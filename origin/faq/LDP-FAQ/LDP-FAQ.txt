Q: What is LDP?
A: LDP is a loosely knit team of volunteers who provide documentation for many
   aspects of Linux. There are several forms of documentation: Guides, HOWTOs, man
   pages, and FAQs.
Q: What is a Guide?
A: A guide is typically a longer book with broader coverage of a subject; for
   instance, the Network Administration or User Guide. The intent is to understand
   the whole subject, as opposed to performing only one task. If you want to have a
   broader look at some aspect of Linux, then the guides should be very handy.
Q: What is a HOWTO?
A: A HOWTO is usually a step-by-step guide that describe, in detail, how to perform a
   specific task. For example, you can use the Linux Installation HOWTO to help you
   install Linux on a system, but it does not cover how to set up a Web server so
   that you can focus on a particular task.
Q: What is a man page?
A: A man (Manual) page is a standard form of help that is available for many Linux
   applications and utilities. You can view man pages by using the man command. Many
   of the GNU utilities have a more detailed form of help, called info pages. You can
   view info pages by using the info command.
Q: What is an FAQ?
A: An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) is a list of questions that are usually
   available in mailing lists. An FAQ is used to avoid answering repetitive questions
   that are asked by new users. For example, the Linux FAQ answers questions like,
   “What is Linux?” and “How is Linux pronounced?”
Q: Where can I get all of these documents?
A: Most Linux distributions include LDP documents, so there is a high chance that
   they are already available for you if you've installed Linux. The latest versions
   that are available at the LDP Web site, http://www.tldp.org.
Q: How are the documents licensed?
A: LDP has documents that are available only under a free license, like the GNU Free
   Documentation License. This means that you are allowed to distribute, modify, and
   do what ever you want to do to the documents, as long as you do not change the
   copyright and licensing terms.
Q: Are all of the topics that are in the LDP related to Linux?
A: Yes. There are several other applications, languages, and operating systems that
   are covered at the LDP. LDP accepts the document if it is of any interest to
   general Linux users. For example, the Linux+Windows HOWTO explains, in detail, how
   your Linux system can coexist with Windows. Documents that do not relate directly
   to Linux won't be accepted.
Q: Who contributes to LDP?
A: Application developers, who usually provide help files with their programs, often
   submit their documentation to LDP. Increasingly, new users solve their Linux
   issues and document their work to help others in the community.
Q: Why should I contribute?
A: Authors who want to help others by providing some documentation can do so through
   LDP. The documents should be under a free license, such as the GNU free
   documentation license, which ensures that everyone is benefited through your
   documents. Here are some of the major benefits when you contribute through LDP:

   * LDP hosts the document and ensures that it is available in many formats,
     including text, html, and pdf, so that Linux users can view it in a platform-
     independent manner.
   * LDP documents are available as part of many distributions and, hence, your
     documents reach a large community of Linux users.
   * Many of the Linux users who read your document may give you comments,
     suggestions, or even provide additional content that ensures the document is
     reliable and updated whenever necessary.
   * You may be providing some crucial help to users who come across the same issues
     that you have solved on your own.
   * It is a form of contribution to the Linux and open source community which
     depends on volunteers for its growth.
   * You may also publish any of LDP documents, including your own, and get monetary
     benefits from the whole process.

Q: How can I contribute?
A: If you know a particular topic well, first search the LDP Web site, http://
   www.tldp.org, for related documentation. If something is already available, you
   can contact the author through e-mail, which will probably be available within the
   document, and coordinate your work together. You can take care of the documents
   that are not maintained. If the topic is an entirely new one, subscribe to the
   Discussion mailing list at <discuss@en.tldp.org>, propose the topic to your peers
   first, and then gather feedback. After you receive feedback and complete the
   draft, you can submit the document by using the instructions that are in the LDP
   Author Guide, http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide. Be sure to advise LDP that
   you followed the steps that are listed in the LDP Author Guide. This avoids having
   someone come back later and tell you that this subject was not acceptable (which
   is rarely the case). Contact the HOWTO coordinator who is listed at the LDP Web
   site if you require any expert help. When you follow the above steps, you are
   ensured the following benefits:

   * If any other person is interested in contributing, you can team up.
   * The topic that you wish to cover may already be available as part of some other
     documentation that you are not aware of; you may want to e-mail the list so that
     you can avoid repetitive work.
   * You can receive guidance in the form of help, tools, and other resources that
     can speed up your writing.

   Because LDP is an informal organisation of volunteers, you do not need any kind of
   membership to contribute. Everyone is encouraged to help in whatever way they can.
Q: In which format should I write the documentation?
A: In any format you would like! Documents will be maintained in DocBook XML or
   LinuxDoc and will be converted for you by a volunteer. You may choose to use an
   editing suite (like OpenOffice.org) to write the DocBook for you. There are also
   scripts available to convert LyX and ASCII documents to DocBook.
Q: DocBook is too hard to learn for a LyX user like me. Why do you use it?
A: It's not just LyX users that say this, but here's the answer... There are hundreds
   of documents in our collection. We have one set of scripts to convert each of
   these documents into human-readable formats (HTML, PostScript and PDF). We use
   these scripts not only to save time, but also to keep our collection visually
   similar, as requested by many of our readers (read http://ask.slashdot.org/
   article.pl?sid=04/03/30/0041253 for more information. DocBook is a very
   descriptive markup language specifically desgined to describe technical
   documentation. Always under active development, DocBook is be used to output a
   variety of formats, including HTML pages, slide shows, PDF and PostScript for
   printed materials. We are always interested in hearing about scripts or tools for
   converting text to DocBook. Please read the Author_Guide and contribute your ideas
   to the “Discuss” mailing list. LyX users should also read http://www.teledyn.com/
   help/XML/lyx2db/t1.html for more information.
Q: How should I submit documentation?
A: For your convenience, this process is summarized in our Author_Guide.
Q: Will my document be reviewed before it is accepted to the collection?
A: All new documents are reviewed according to the LDP_Reviewer_HOWTO. Each document
   will go through three reviews: technical, language and meta-data. You can read
   about these reviews in the LDP Reviewer HOWTO.
Q: What if I have question that hasn't been answered here?
A: If your question hasn't been answered in this FAQ, please send e-mail to the
   Discussion list (<discuss@en.tldp.org>) after subscribing to it. More information
   is also available at http://www.tldp.org/mailinfo.html. If someone on the
   Discussion list answers the question and you feel that it should be included here,
   send a copy of both the question that you asked and the answer that you received
   to the author of this document. The author's e-mail address is listed at the top
   of this page.
