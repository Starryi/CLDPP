computers. To simplify network administration, most networks (mostly
Sun-based networks) run the Network Information Service. Linux machines
can take full advantage of existing NIS service or provide NIS service
themselves. Linux machines can also act as full NIS+ clients, this
support is in beta stage.</P

is a choice between laziness and maturity vs. flexibility and love of

inflexibility.</P

library to include the NYS code into it (or maybe you can
get a precompiled version of libc from someone who has already done it).</P

for NIS Netgroups, which the NYS code doesn't. On the other hand
the NYS code allows you to handle Shadow Passwords in a transparent
way. The "traditonal NIS" code doesn't support Shadow Passwords over NIS.</P

severe security needs. NIS+ is much more problematic to administer
(it's pretty easy to handle on the client side, but the server side
is horrible). Another problem is that the support for NIS+ under Linux
contains a lot of bugs and that the development has stopped.</P

>4.1. How NIS works&#13;</A
></H3
><P
>Within a network there must be at least one machine acting as a NIS
server. You can have multiple NIS servers, each serving different NIS
"domains" - or you can have cooperating NIS servers, where one is the
master NIS server, and all the other are so-called slave NIS servers
(for a certain NIS "domain", that is!) - or you can have a mix
of them...</P
><P
>Slave servers only have copies of the NIS databases and receive these
copies from the master NIS server whenever changes are made to the
master's databases.  Depending on the number of machines in your
network and the reliability of your network, you might decide to
install one or more slave servers.  Whenever a NIS server goes down or
is too slow in responding to requests, a NIS client connected to that
server will try to find one that is up or faster.</P
><P
>NIS databases are in so-called DBM format, derived from ASCII
databases.  For example, the files <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/group</TT
> can be directly converted to DBM format
using ASCII-to-DBM translation software (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>makedbm</B
>,
included with the server software). The master NIS server should have
both, the ASCII databases and the DBM databases.</P
><P
>Slave servers  will be notified of any change to the NIS maps, (via the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>yppush</B
> program), and automatically retrieve the
necessary changes in order to synchronize their databases. NIS clients
do not need to do this since they always talk to the NIS server to read
the information stored in it's DBM databases.</P
><P
>Old ypbind versions do a broadcast to find a running NIS server.
This is insecure, due the fact that anyone may install a NIS server
and answer the broadcast queries. Newer Versions of ypbind
(ypbind-3.3 or ypbind-mt) are able to get the server from a
configuration file - thus no need to broadcast.</P

>NIS+ is a new version of the network information nameservice from Sun.
The biggest difference between NIS and NIS+ is that NIS+ has
support for data encryption and authentication over secure RPC.</P
><P
>The  naming  model of NIS+ is based upon a tree structure. Each node in
the tree corresponds to an NIS+ object, from which we have six types:
directory, entry, group, link, table and private.</P
><P
>The NIS+ directory that forms the root of the NIS+ namespace is called
the root directory. There are two special NIS+ directories:
org_dir and groups_dir. The org_dir directory consists of all
administration tables, such as passwd, hosts, and mail_aliases. The
groups_dir directory consists of NIS+ group objects which are used for
access control. The collection of org_dir, groups_dir and their parent
directory is referred to as an NIS+ domain.</P

>5. The RPC Portmapper

&#13;</A
></H2
><P
>To run any of the software mentioned below you will need to run the
program /sbin/portmap. Some Linux distributions already have
the code in the /sbin/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/ files to start up this
daemon. All you have to do is to activate it and reboot your Linux
machine. Read your Linux Distribution Documentation how to do this.</P
><P
>The RPC portmapper (portmap(8)) is a server that converts RPC program
numbers into TCP/IP (or UDP/IP) protocol port numbers. It must be
running in order to make RPC calls (which is what the NIS/NIS+ client
software does) to RPC servers (like a NIS or NIS+ server) on that machine.
When an RPC server is started, it will tell portmap what port number it
is listening to, and what RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it
will first contact portmap on the server machine to determine the port
number where RPC packets should be sent.</P
><P
>Since RPC servers could be started by inetd(8), portmap should
be running before inetd is started.</P
><P
>For secure RPC, the portmapper needs the Time service. Make sure, that the
Time service is enabled in /etc/inetd.conf on all hosts:

ypcat, yppoll, ypmatch). The most important program is ypbind. This
program must be running at all times, which means, it should always appear

be started from the system's startup file (eg. /etc/init.d/nis,

The new yp-tools 2.4 should work with every Linux libc. Since there was
a bug in the NIS code, you shouldn't use libc 5.4.21-5.4.35. Use libc
5.4.36 or later instead, or the most YP programs will not work.
ypbind 3.3 will work with all libraries, too. If you use gcc 2.8.x or
greater, egcs or glibc 2.x, you should add the ypbind-3.3-glibc5.diff
patch to ypbind 3.3. If possible you should avoid the use of ypbind 3.3
for security reasons.
ypbind-mt is a new, multithreaded daemon. It needs a Linux 2.2 kernel

>rpc.ypxfrd is used for speed up the transfer of very large
NIS  maps  from a NIS master to NIS slave servers. If a
NIS slave server receives a message that there is  a  new
map,  it  will  start  ypxfr  for transfering the new map.
ypxfr will read the contents of  a  map  from  the  master
server  using the yp_all() function. This process can take
several minutes when there are very large maps which  have
to store by the database library.</P
><P
>The  rpc.ypxfrd  server  speeds up the transfer process by
allowing NIS slave  servers  to  simply  copy  the  master
server's  map  files  rather  than building their own from
scratch.  rpc.ypxfrd uses an RPC-based file transfer  protocol,
so that there is no need for building a new map.</P

very slow, it should be started with ypserv. You need to start

You can't just increase this value and recompile the system. Every system

in size; if you suddenly make YPMAXRECORD larger on your client and server,
you will break interoperability with all other systems on your network that
use NIS. To make it work right, you'd have to go to every vendor that supports
NIS and get them to all make the change at the same time. Chances are you

   slightly differnet.

2. keep the GID the same for all.

3. have the first entry with the right group name and the GID.
   I don't put any user names in this one.

What happens is that going by user name you pick up the GID when the code
reads it. Then going the other way it stops after the first match of GID
and takes that name. It's ugly but works!</PRE

>The standard way to change a NIS password is to call
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>yppasswd</B
>, on some systems this is only
an alias for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd</B
>. This commands uses
the yppasswd protocol and needs a running
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpc.yppasswdd</B
> process on the NIS master
server. The protocol has the disadvantage, that the old
password will be send in clear text over the network.
This is not so problematic, if the password change was
successfull. In this case, the old password is replaced
with the new one. But if the password change fails, an attacker
can use the clear password to login as this user.
Even more worse: If the system administrator changes the
NIS password for another user, the root password of the NIS
master server is transfered in clear text over the network.
And this one will not be changed.</P
><P
>One solution is to not use yppasswd for changing the password.
Instead, a good alternative is the <B

command from the <TT
