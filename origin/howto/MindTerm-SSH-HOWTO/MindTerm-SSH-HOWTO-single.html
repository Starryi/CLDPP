><P
>   Businesses, schools, and home users need more secure network services now more than ever. As
   online business increases, more people continue to access critical company information over insecure
   networks. Companies are using the Internet as a primary means to communicate with travelling
   employees in their country and abroad, sending documents to various field offices around the world,
   and sending unencrypted email; this communication can contain a wealth of information that any
   malicious person can potentially intercept and sell or give to a rival company. Good security policies
   for both users and network administrators can help to minimize the problems associated with a
   malicious person intercepting or stealing critical information within their organization. This paper
   will discuss using Secure Shell (SSH) and MindTerm to secure organizational communication across
   the Internet.
  </P
><P
>   Home users and business travelers are accessing company resources and sending sensitive data over
   insecure networks. <EM
>This opens up a whole new area of security issues for System Administrators
   (Securing the home office sensible and securely)</EM

   home with high-speed access is expected to <EM

>The increase in the number of airports and
   hotels offering internet access, especially high-speed access, is increasing and is expected to grow in
   the future (Broadband Moving On Up)</EM
>. This can also leave a door wide open for a malicious person to
   hijack or view a person's Internet traffic and access their companies. The malicious person may not be
   interested in the work the employee is doing but just want access to a high-speed server to launch
   attacks, store files, or other uses. Business people are really at high risk because they don't know who's
   monitoring their Internet connection in the hotel, airport, or anywhere in their travels. Users of the
   new high-speed connections are usually not taught proper security protocols and some companies
   don't have the staff to help the home user and business traveler set up secure communication.
   Individual users and, surprisingly, some companies have a mentality that <EM
>"I don't have anything people
   want"</EM
>. This is very disturbing considering the amount of sensitive information that travels across the
   Internet from an employee's home or from travelers. What's more disturbing is the availability of free
   software to perform these kinds of attacks and the software's ease of use. Dsniff
   (<A
HREF="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/"

>http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/</A
>)
   is a freely available program that has utilities that can allow
   anyone with a networked computer to highjack a local network and monitor what others are doing and
   grab passwords and other sensitive data. In his book Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked
   World, Bruce Schneier states that Technique Propagation is one of the main threats to network
   security: <EM
>"The Internet is...a perfect medium for propagating successful attack tools. Only the first
   attacker has to be skilled; everyone else can use his software" (Schneier)</EM

>The way to ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely and quickly is to use encrypted methods
of data delivery. This can be by way of encrypted email, using secure web-based email services, or
establishing encrypted tunnels between two computers. Also, easy to setup and reliable software need
to be used in order to allow the inexperienced users the ability to quickly establish secure
communication channels. Taten Ylonen 's

>SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure replacement for remote login and file transfer programs like telnet, rsh,
and ftp, which transmit data in clear, human-readable text. SSH uses a public-key authentication
method to establish an encrypted and secure connection from the user's machine to the remote
machine. When the secure connection is established then the username, password, and all other
information is sent over this secure connection. You can read more details of how ssh works, the
algorithms it uses, and the protocols implemented for it to maintain a high level of security and trust
at the ssh website: 
<A
HREF="http://www.ssh.com"
TARGET="_top"
>www.ssh.com</A
>. The OpenBSD team has created a free alternative called OpenSSH
available at:
<A
HREF="http://www.openssh.com"
TARGET="_top"
>www.openssh.com</A
>. It maintains the high security standards of the OpenBSD team and the
IETF specifications for Secure Shell (see the
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/secsh.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Secure Shell IETF drafts</A
>,
except it uses free public domain algorithms. SSH is
becoming a standard for remote login administration. It has become so popular that there are many
ports of ssh to various platforms and there are free clients available to login to an ssh server from
many platforms as well. See 
<A
HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/security/ssh-clients"
TARGET="_top"
>http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/security/ssh-clients</A
>
for a list of clients
and Securityportal.com has an excellent two-part article on ssh and links to ports for different
platforms available at 
<A
HREF="http://www.securityportal.com/research/ssh-part1.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.securityportal.com/research/ssh-part1.html</A
>.
There are programs
that also use an ssh utility called Secure Copy (scp) in the background that provide the same
functionality of a full ftp client, like
<A
HREF="http://winscp.vse.cz"
TARGET="_top"
>WinSCP</A
> and the
<A
HREF="http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/"
TARGET="_top"
>Java SSH/SCP Client</A
>,
which has a modified scp interface for MindTerm. Please read the
licenses carefully to determine if you are legally allowed to download ssh in your country. SSH is free
for academic institutions please. Please read the licenses available at the ssh.com website. </P
><P
>MindTerm is an ssh client written entirely in Java by MindBright Technology. One of the key
practices of developing security software is proper implementation of the underlying algorithms and
protocols it uses. MindBright Technology has implemented the ssh protocol very well in this small
application file. It is a self-contained archive that only needs to be unzipped into a directory of your
choice and it is ready to be used. It can be used as a standalone program or as a web page applet or both.
It is available at: 
<A
HREF="http://www.mindbright.se/download/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.mindbright.se/download/</A
>.
MindTerm is an excellent and inexpensive
client to secure communication to and from a local and remote location. The MindTerm program
located at the download address above is available free for non-commercial and academic use,
commercial use is available on a case to case basis. However, the modifications made by the
<A
HREF="http://www.isnetworks.net"
TARGET="_top"
>ISNetwork</A
>
 <EM
>"is based on the MindTerm 1.21 codebase, which MindBright released
under the GPL [General Public License -- see
<A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org"
TARGET="_top"
> 
http://www.gnu.org</A
>].
Since our version is released
under the GPL you can use it commercially for free" (Eckels)</EM
>. ISNetwork's implementation has all the
features of MindBright's MindTerm except it has a nicer scp interface for more user-friendly file
transfers. MindTerm does have some drawbacks in that it doesn't support UDP tunneling. In order to
secure UDP traffic, a program called Zebedee (
<A
HREF="http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/</A
>)
will work nicely.
Zebedee's server and client program is available for Windows and Linux platforms. It is freely
distributed under the GPL License too. You can connect to either Windows or Linux machines using
Zebedee. MindTerm will not check to see if your system is secure. It is up to the administrators and
users to take care of securing the computer systems. It is easy to implement and it is very effective at
maintaining the high level of security implemented in the ssh protocol. This paper will show how easy
it is to set up and establish secure communication channels for almost any user and by almost any user.
Documents, email, and other data communication can be easily and securely sent to users a few feet
away or around the world.</P

NAME="MINDTERM-WORK"
>2.3. How MindTerm and SSH work together</A
></H3
><P
>SSH and MindTerm will work together to use a technique called port forwarding. Port forwarding is
forwarding traffic from one host and a given port to another host and port. In other words, the
MindTerm application will open a port on the client's machine (local machine) and any connection to
that local port is forwarded to the remote host and its listening port over an encrypted ssh session.
Whether or not the connection is accepted depends on the type of request you are sending to the
remote host. For example, you wouldn't forward POP requests to a remote host listening on port 21
because port 21 is reserved for ftp requests. Port forwarding is also used to allow connections to a
server that is behind a firewall and/or has a private IP address. Essentially this is creating a Virtual
Private Network (VPN). A VPN is <EM
>"a private data network that makes use of the public
telecommunication infrastructure, maintaining privacy through the use of a tunneling protocol and
security procedures"</EM
> (
<A
HREF="http://www.whatis.com"
TARGET="_top"
>www.whatis.com</A
>
). The port-forwarding can only be done with TCP services.</P

you have ssh already installed on your server or workstation. If not then you can read the
documentation that comes with the ssh or the OpenSSH package for installation instructions for your
platform. For the examples that follow, OpenSSH was installed on a RedHat 7.0 server and
workstation. OpenSSH was installed on RedHat 6.0- 7.0 and worked the same. The client machine
used in the following tutorial is a Windows 2000 machine. Windows 95/98, NT 4.0, NT 5.0, RedHat
6.0-7.0 workstation were all tested as client machines and worked the same. On a side note, the exact
same MindTerm jar archive was used on all client systems tested.

>First, make sure that your server is secure. Though traffic is encrypted as it travels over the Internet, it
can be sniffed if someone has root access on the local machine and uses a program like
<A
HREF="http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/ngrep"
TARGET="_top"
> 
ngrep</A
> to sniff traffic on a local machine. For example, in
conjunction with the dsniff program mentioned above, the following command could sniff all traffic
on the local interface network: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ngrep -d lo</B
>. Securing the server is, however, beyond the scope of this
paper.</P
><P
>We'll use the POP (port 110), IMAP (port 143), SMTP (port 25), VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
(5901+), and NTOP (default port 3000) services for this example. All traffic will be forwarded to each
service's respective port on the remote host running the ssh server. All services listening on the
remote host listen on all interfaces, unless the service binds to a specific port by default or if manually
configured. In order to show how effective this technique of tunneling over ssh is, we will only allow
particular services to listen on the local interface.</P
><P
>You don't have to change your current security configurations, however. We will use tcp_wrappers,
that is installed by default with RedHat 7.0 (and previous versions), to connect to the network services.

>This sets sshd (the ssh server) to allow connections from anywhere any IP address. The other services
only allow connections from the local interface. You can verify this by configuring a mail client to
connect to your remote pop or imap server and/or an ftp client to connect to your ftp server, right now.
It won't allow you to connect. You'll also need to set up any user accounts to allow access to these
services. (Note: The setup above is only useful if the services are only for internal use and remote users
need to access the internal services to send and receive email or transfer files. The services can be
available for public use and be encrypted with ssh and MindTerm.) If MindTerm will be used over the
web to create tunnels or use the secure copy GUI features then a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
will need to be installed on the server running SSH as well.</P

Remember that the remote server name or POP server name will be "<EM
>localhost:</EM
>". If you are asked for
the POP server and port seperately then add it accordingly. Any connections to the local port 2010, in
this example, will be forwarded to the remote hosts' port 110. If you configure an ftp client to connect
to the localhost port 2010, right now it wouldn't work. Why? The POP protocol doesn't understand ftp
protocol. Only POP clients can be forwarded to the localhost port 2010 for the tunnel to be effective.
A POP server isn't any good if you don't have an smtp server. If you have a mail program like Postfix (
<A
HREF="http://www.postfix.net"
TARGET="_top"
>www.postfix.net</A
>), Qmail (<A

software can be pre-configured for remote profiles that connect to the tunnels automatically.</P

>When you are finished using the MindTerm, be sure to close all applications that are using a tunnel. If
you forget to close the programs using the tunnels, MindTerm will display a message when you attempt

><P
>What about VNC and NTOP? These services work the same way. Here the VNC server was running
on a RedHat 7.0 workstation. When you start the VNC server, it first listens on port 5901 and each
server after that increments up 1 port so the second instance of VNC will listen on port 5902, and the
third 5903, etc.. On Linux, you can run multiple VNC servers and people can connect to each VNC
server as well. In MindTerm you can simply add a VNC tunnel with the following settings:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Local Port: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>2001</B
></P

>.</P
></LI

> <EM
>(If this is the first server instance running)</EM
></P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Click <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Add</B
>.
Then click <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>OK</B
> on the confirmation menu.</P
><P
>Run the vncviewer application on your local machine and type: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>localhost:2001</B
>, and then the
password, when prompted, for the VNC desktop and you have an encrypted VNC session.</P
><P
>Ntop works the same way. If you want to run ntop in web mode as a network monitor, you can tunnel
connections to your local machine and view the stats in your local browser, without having to install a
webserver or opening port 3000 on your remote server. By default, ntop in web mode listens on port
3000 and waits for an http connection to display network stats. Simply create a tunnel to the server
running the ssh server and ntop. First run ntop in web mode: ntop -d -w 3000 Then add the settings
to the MindTerm tunnel:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Local Port: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>2080</B
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Host: <EM
>Server running ntop</EM
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Remote Port: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>3000</B
></P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Click <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Add</B
>.
Then click <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>OK</B
> on the confirmation menu.</P
><P
>Open up your web browser and in the location bar type: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>http://localhost:2080</B
> You should now see
the network stats page for ntop (see the ntop man pages to add password protected access to the ntop
display). Similarly, if you want to install a web server so you can use web-based applications to control
your server or firewall, then just create a tunnel to port 80. You don't have to open up a port on the
public interface. Simply bind the webserver to the local interface and create a tunnel to the remote
hosts' port 80. For Apache, edit the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>httpd.conf</TT
> file and change the <EM
>BindAddress *</EM
> option to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>BindAddress 127.0.0.1</B
>. Then add <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>localhost</B
> to the <EM
>ServerName directive</EM
>: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ServerName localhost</B
>. Finally, change the <EM
>Listen</EM
> directive to:  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Listen 127.0.0.1:80</B
>
As you can see by now MindTerm can secure almost any TCP service. It can be used on a remote
server to run
<A
HREF="http://www.webmin.com/webmin"
TARGET="_top"
>Webmin</A
>,
which is an excellent web-application to
administer your servers. It comes with its own perl-based webserver and listens on port 10000 by
default. Simply create a tunnel to it using MindTerm and it should work without any changes to the
Webmin application or your local web browser. The MindTerm download zip file contains many
useful examples, such as using it from the command line and an explanation of all the menu options.
MindTerm has more features than outlined in this tutorial but the tunnel option is well worth
spending time focusing on.</P

>When an ssh session starts, the public-keys are being sent over an insecure connection until the
authentication process is established.. This allows a person to intercept an ssh session and place their
own public key in the connection process. SSH is designed to warn the user if a public-key has changed
from what exists in their known_host file. The warning that is given is quite noticeable and ssh will
drop the connection if the public keys are different, but user's may still trust the certificate because
they may think that their company has changed the server's public key. This kind of attack isn't
difficult because the dsniff package mentioned earlier contains the tools to perform it. This attack is
more commonly called a <EM

>A temporary and easy fix for this is to first teach the user's how to recognize the signs that the host
key has changed and what to do to get the proper host(s) public key. Second, post the public key for the
ssh server(s) on a website, ftp server, or distribute it some other way so that users have access to it at

>SSH and MindTerm together can provide local and remote users with a high-level of security with a
simple and small drop-in application. It can also be used from nearly any platform available. Java was
chosen because of its cross-platform compatibility. If there is a JRE available for a platform that
someone uses then they can use the MindTerm application to communicate securely over long
distances. Since ssh is becoming the standard for remote administration and logins, soon nearly all
platforms will be able to run an ssh server. MindBright is currently working on a Java SSH server.</P

>This tutorial also shows how someone can tunnel through a firewall. This is by no means the intention
of this paper. It is hoped people will use it for a secure, quick, and free drop-in VPN-like replacement
for remote administration, traveling business people, and a hope that other sectors can see the
usefulness in this excellent program. As long as you are allowed to make ssh connections then you can
tunnel services through to a remote machine. System and Security Administrators should establish
policies against tunneling through firewalls because that can cause internal security breaches if used
improperly. Remember that the communication is secured but the commands and files that you access
and/or download are still being executed on your local and remote machines. Also, any commands you
type on most servers are being logged as well. SSH will protect the data over the network or the
Internet but what is done on the remote machines can be logged. SSH and MindTerm will not protect
against someone gaining access to a remote user's computer and installing key logging programs or
other snooping devices.</P

>It is very simple and quick to set up secure communications but the only way to increase the use of
secure communication is for users to encourage their company, financial institutions, health care
providers, and other businesses to offer secure services.</P
