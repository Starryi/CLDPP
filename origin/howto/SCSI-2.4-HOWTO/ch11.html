A raw device can be bound to an existing block device (e.g. a disk) and be
used to perform "raw" IO with that existing block device. Such "raw" IO
bypasses the caching that is normally associated with block devices. 
Hence a raw device offers a more "direct" route to the physical device
and allows an application more control over the timing of IO to that
physical device. This makes raw devices suitable for complex applications
like Database Management Systems that typically do their own caching.
</p><p>
Raw devices are character devices (major number 162). The first
minor number (i.e. 0) is reserved as a control interface and is usually
found at <code class="filename">/dev/rawctl</code>. A utility called <span class="command"><strong>raw
</strong></span> (see <span class="command"><strong>man raw</strong></span>) can be used to bind a raw
device to an existing block device. These "existing block devices" may be
disks or cdroms/dvds whose underlying interface can be anything supported
by Linux (e.g. IDE/ATA or SCSI).
</p><p>
A sequence of commands listing the raw devices and then binding
a SCSI disk partition followed by binding the whole disk looks
like this on my system:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ ls -lR /dev/raw*
crw-r--r--    1 root     root     162,   0 Dec  6 06:54 /dev/rawctl

/dev/raw:
total 0
crw-r--r--    1 root     root     162,   1 Dec  6 06:54 raw1
crw-r--r--    1 root     root     162,   2 Dec  6 06:54 raw2
crw-r--r--    1 root     root     162,   3 Dec  6 06:54 raw3
crw-r--r--    1 root     root     162,   4 Dec  6 06:54 raw4
$
$ raw -qa
$
$ raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/sda3
/dev/raw/raw1:  bound to major 8, minor 3
$ raw /dev/raw/raw2 /dev/sda
/dev/raw/raw2:  bound to major 8, minor 0
$ raw -qa
/dev/raw/raw1:  bound to major 8, minor 3
/dev/raw/raw2:  bound to major 8, minor 0
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The normal array of system calls for character devices are available on
raw devices. The size of the transfer for read(2) and write(2) must be
an integral multiple of the physical device's block size. For a disk
this will be its sector size which is normally 512 bytes. The data buffer
given to read() and write() system calls must be aligned to the block 
size. The lseek(2) call needs to align its file read/write offset to a block
boundary as well. The pread(3) call (see <span class="command"><strong>man pread</strong></span>)
combines a read() and an lseek() and can be useful with raw devices (ditto with 
pwrite() ). Care should be taken with offsets greater than 2 GB (or perhaps
4 GB) on 32 bit architectures where the "off_t" type is 32 bits long.
One solution is to use the _llseek() call (see <span class="command"><strong>man llseek</strong></span>).
</p><p>
Unix utilities such as recent versions of <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> and 
<span class="command"><strong>lmdd</strong></span> (from the lmbench suite of programs) can be used
to move data to and from "raw" devices as they meet the above-mentioned
block alignment requirements. Recent versions of the <span class="command"><strong>sg_dd</strong></span>
command in the sg_utils package can access both raw and sg devices.
</p><p>
Also note that if the physical device has an odd number of sectors (as 
shown by <span class="command"><strong>blockdev --getsize /dev/raw/raw*</strong></span>), the last
sector will not be accessible using raw IO.

If a block device is being accessed via a bound raw device and also via
its normal block interface then there is no cache coherency between the
two access mechanisms. For example if <code class="filename">/dev/sda1</code> was
both mounted and being accessed via a bound raw device then there could be
data inconsistencies.
