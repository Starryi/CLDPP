The SCSI Command Utility (SCU) implements various SCSI commands necessary
for normal maintenance and diagnostics of SCSI peripherals. Some of its
features include: formatting, scanning for (and reassigning) bad blocks,
downloading new firmware, executing diagnostics and obtaining
performance information. It is available on several Unix platforms
(and NT), however it is only currently available in binary form. See
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bit-net.com/~rmiller/scu.html" target="_top">
www.bit-net.com/~rmiller/scu.html</a> for more details.
</p><p><b>dd. </b>
Very useful for testing the streaming performance of disks and cdroms/dvds.
See <span class="command"><strong>man dd</strong></span> for more details. Here is an example for
timing how long a disk takes to read 1 GB (10**9 bytes) starting from block 0:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ time dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=512 count=1953126
</pre><p>
If the raw device <code class="filename">/dev/raw/raw1</code> is bound to
<code class="filename">/dev/sda</code> then the above line is equivalent to:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ time dd if=/dev/raw/raw1 of=/dev/null bs=512 count=1953126
</pre><p>
This may be slower than expected since one 512 byte sector is being read
at a time. Changing the last 2 arguments to "bs=8k count=122071" should
give better timings for the "raw" dd.
</p><p><b>dt. </b>
The Data Test (DT) program is modelled on dd's syntax but dt can do a
lot more than sequential copies. It is a comprehensive data test program
for SCSI devices such as disks, tapes and cdrom/dvds. It is available on
several Unix platforms (and NT), and its source is available (unlike its
stable mate "scu" discussed earlier). See 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.bit-net.com/~rmiller/dt.html" target="_top">
www.bit-net.com/~rmiller/dt.html</a> for more details.
</p><p><b>lmdd. </b>
This command is part of the lmbench suite of programs and is a variant of the
<span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command. It has been tailored for IO measurements
and outputs timing and throughput numbers on completion. Hence the
<span class="command"><strong>time</strong></span> command and a calculator are not needed.
</p><p><b>blockdev. </b>
Fetches the sector size, the number of sectors and read ahead status
of a block device (typically a disk). Can also be used to flush buffers
and reread the partition table. See <span class="command"><strong>man blockdev</strong></span>.
</p><p><b>sg_dd. </b>
This command is part of the sg_utils package (see 
<a class="link" href="apf.html#W4">W4</a>) and is another variant of the
<span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command in which either the input and/or
output file is a sg or a raw device. The block size argument ("bs") must
match that of the physical device in question. The "skip" and "seek" arguments
can be up to 2**31 - 1 on a 32 bit architecture allowing 1TB disks to be
accessed (2G * 512). The Linux system command llseek() is used to seek with
a 64 bit file read/write offset. The <span class="command"><strong>lmdd</strong></span> does not
handle the &gt; 2GB case and the <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command gets creative
with multiple relative seeks. <span class="command"><strong>sg_dd</strong></span> has
a "bpt" (blocks per transfer) argument that controls the number of blocks
read or written in each IO transaction.
</p><p>
There are other programs in the sg_utils package to scan the SCSI bus
(<span class="command"><strong>sg_scan</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>sg_map</strong></span>), to measure
SCSI bus throughput (<span class="command"><strong>sg_rbuf</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>sg_turs
</strong></span>), show data from the SCSI inquiry command
(<span class="command"><strong>sg_inq</strong></span>) and spin up (or down) media
(<span class="command"><strong>sg_start</strong></span>).
</p><p><b>dd_rescue + scsiinfo. </b>
This dd variant is designed to rescue damaged media such as SCSI (or IDE)
disks and CDROMs (see <a class="link" href="apf.html#W6">W6</a>). The <span class="command"><strong>
scsiinfo</strong></span> utility for displaying and changing mode page
information is also at that site.
</p><p><b>sard. </b>
This utility is modelled on System V Release 4's <span class="command"><strong>sar -d</strong></span> for
producing IO statistics for mounted devices and partitions. It has been
developed by Stephen Tweedie and includes the sard utility and a required
kernel patch which expands the output of <code class="filename">/proc/partitions</code>
. It can be found at 
<a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/profiling" target="_top">
ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/profiling</a>. It collects statistics
at a relatively low level (e.g. SCSI mid level) compared to programs
like <span class="command"><strong>vmstat</strong></span> (see "man vmstat").
