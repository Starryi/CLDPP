A device name can be thought of as a gateway to a kernel driver that
controls a device rather than the device itself. Hence there can be
multiple device names some of which may offer slightly different
characteristics, all mapping to the same actual device.
</p><p>
The device names of the various SCSI devices are found within the
<code class="filename">/dev</code> directory. Traditionally in Linux, SCSI
devices have been identified by their major and minor device number
rather than their SCSI bus addresses (e.g. SCSI target id and LUN).
The device pseudo file system (devfs) moves away from the major and
minor device number scheme and for the SCSI subsystem uses device names
based on the SCSI bus addresses [discussed later in
<a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html" title="3. Device Names in devfs">Section 3, &#8220;Device Names in devfs&#8221;</a> and see reference: <a class="link" href="apf.html#W5">W5</a>].
Alternatively, there is a utility called <span class="command"><strong>scsidev</strong></span>
which addresses this issue within the scope of the Linux SCSI subsystem
and thus does not have the same system wide impact as devfs. Scsidev is
discussed later in <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html" title="4. Device Names in scsidev">Section 4, &#8220;Device Names in scsidev&#8221;</a> and ref: 
<a class="link" href="apf.html#W6">W6</a>.

Eight block major numbers are reserved for SCSI disks: 8, 65, 66, 67, 68,
69, 70 and 71. Each major can accommodate 256 minor numbers which, in the
case of SCSI disks, are subdivided as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[b,8,0]    /dev/sda
[b,8,1]    /dev/sda1
....
[b,8,15]   /dev/sda15
[b,8,16]   /dev/sdb
[b,8,17]   /dev/sdb1
....
[b,8,255]  /dev/sdp15
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The disk device names without a trailing digit refer to the whole disk
(e.g. <code class="filename">/dev/sda</code>)
while those with a trailing digit refer to one of the 15 allowable
partitions 
<a href="#ftn.idm172" class="footnote" name="idm172"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>
within that disk.
</p><p>
The remaining 7 SCSI disk block major numbers follow a similar pattern:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[b,65,0]   /dev/sdq
[b,65,1]   /dev/sdq1
....
[b,65,159] /dev/sdz15
[b,65,160] /dev/sdaa
[b,65,161] /dev/sdaa1
....
[b,65,255] /dev/sdaf15
[b,66,0]   /dev/sdag
[b,66,1]   /dev/sdag1
....
[b,66,255] /dev/sdav15
....
[b,71,255] /dev/sddx15
</pre><p>
</p><p>
So there are 128 possible disks (i.e. <code class="filename">/dev/sda</code> to
<code class="filename">/dev/sddx</code>) each having up
to 15 partitions. By way of contrast, the IDE subsystem allows 20 disks
(10 controllers each with 1 master and 1 slave) which can have up to 63
partitions each.
</p><p>
SCSI CD-ROM devices are allocated the block major number of 11. Traditionally
<code class="filename">sr</code> has been the device name but <code class="filename">scd</code>
probably is more recognizable and is
favoured by several recent distributions. 256 SCSI CD-ROM devices are
allowed:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[b,11,0]   /dev/scd0          [or /dev/sr0]
[b,11,255] /dev/scd255        [or /dev/sr255]
</pre><p>
</p><p>
SCSI tape devices are allocated the char major number of 9. Up to 32 tape
devices are supported each of which can be accessed in one of four modes
(0, 1, 2 and 3), with or without rewind. The devices are allocated as
follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[c,9,0]    /dev/st0     [tape 0, mode 0, rewind]
[c,9,1]    /dev/st1     [tape 1, mode 0, rewind]
....
[c,9,31]   /dev/st31    [tape 31, mode 0, rewind]
[c,9,32]   /dev/st0l    [tape 0, mode 1, rewind]
....
[c,9,63]   /dev/st31l   [tape 31, mode 1, rewind]
[c,9,64]   /dev/st0m    [tape 0, mode 2, rewind]
....
[c,9,96]   /dev/st0a    [tape 0, mode 3, rewind]
....
[c,9,127]  /dev/st31a   [tape 31, mode 3, rewind]
[c,9,128]  /dev/nst0    [tape 0, mode 0, no rewind]
....
[c,9,160]  /dev/nst0l   [tape 0, mode 1, no rewind]
....
[c,9,192]  /dev/nst0m   [tape 0, mode 2, no rewind]
....
[c,9,224]  /dev/nst0a   [tape 0, mode 3, no rewind]
....
[c,9,255]  /dev/nst31a  [tape 31, mode 3, no rewind]
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The SCSI generic (sg) devices are allocated the char major number of 21.
There are 256 possible SCSI generic (sg) devices:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[c,21,0]   /dev/sg0
[c,21,1]   /dev/sg1
....
[c,21,255] /dev/sg255
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Note that the SCSI generic device name's use of a trailing letter (e.g.
<code class="filename">/dev/sgc</code>) is deprecated.
</p><p>
Each SCSI disk (but not each partition), each SCSI CD-ROM and each SCSI
tape is mapped to an sg device. SCSI devices that don't fit into these
three categories (e.g. scanners) also appear as sg devices.
</p><p>
Pseudo devices [see <a class="xref" href="ch10s01.html" title="1. Pseudo drivers">Section 1, &#8220;Pseudo drivers&#8221;</a>] can cause devices
that are usually not considered as SCSI to appear as SCSI device names.
For example an ATAPI CD-ROM may be picked up by the ide-scsi pseudo
driver and mapped to <code class="filename">/dev/scd0</code> .
</p><p>
The <code class="filename">linux/Documentation/devices.txt</code> file supplied
within the kernel source is the definitive reference for Linux device
names and their corresponding major and minor number allocations.

If 15 partitions is too limiting then the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
might be considered. See <code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/Documentation/LVM-HOWTO
</code>. LVM will also allow a logical partition to span multiple
block devices.
