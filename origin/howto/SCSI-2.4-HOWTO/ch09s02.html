CDROM and DVD drives (and WORM devices) are accessible via the sr upper 
level device driver.
While "sr" is the device driver name, "sr_mod" is its module name.
The device file name is either <code class="filename">/dev/sr&lt;n&gt;</code> or
<code class="filename">/dev/scd&lt;n&gt;</code>.
</p><p>
Following is a diagram illustrating the CDROM subsystem of which sr is a
part:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="cdrom.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
      The architecture of the CD-ROM subsystem.
      </p></div></div><p>
This diagram glosses over some of the differences between the 
protocol stacks. CDROM device names are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> maintained
by the uniform CDROM layer but rather by each individual protocol stack.
In the case of the SCSI subsystem, device names are maintained by the
sr driver while the IDE subsystem maintains device names with its
central "ide" driver (i.e. not by the ide-cd driver). USB and IEEE1394
cd devices names are maintained by their respective stacks. This may
partially explain why the <code class="filename">/dev/cdrom</code> is often a
symbolic link to the appropriate subsystem's device name.
</p><p>
Two types of SCSI devices are accessible via the sr driver:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>CD-ROM devices (including DVD players)
[SCSI peripheral device code is 5]</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Write-once read-multiple" devices which are known as WORMs.
[SCSI peripheral device code is 4]</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
The sr driver is capable of recognizing 256 CDROM/DVD drives when it is 
loaded at kernel boot time or later as a module. However, once it is 
loaded, it will only recognize a fixed number of additional drives. The 
number of additional drives that can be accommodated is set by the kernel
configuration parameter CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS whose default value is 2.
</p><p>
People often use the <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command to read a data CDROM
containing an iso9660 file system. If a count argument is not given then
the <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command will read the number of 2048 byte sectors
indicated by the SCSI Read Capacity command. Unfortunately this can 
include unwritten (or "run out") sectors at the end of the image that can
cause I/O errors. Use the <span class="command"><strong>isosize</strong></span> command (see its man 
page) to find the true length of the iso9660 image and use that in the
"count=" argument given to the <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command.

Doing a test to find out if a cdrom drive supports XA mode (mode 2) triggers
firmware bugs on some drives. Consequently the check for XA mode support is
turned off by default. The following module parameter is provided:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    xa_test=&lt;0|1&gt;
</pre><p>
to override the default. [Currently there seems to be no way to turn on
XA mode testing when the sr driver is built into the kernel.]

All the following files are readable by all and produce ASCII output
when read:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
 /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/autoclose
 /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/autoeject
 /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/check_media
 /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/debug
 /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info
 /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/lock
</pre><p>
They reflect the current state of the CDROM subsystem. This location
is part of the procfs's window through to the sysctl configuration
mechanism (see <span class="command"><strong>man sysctl</strong></span>). All but
<code class="filename">info</code> are writable by the superuser. There is
a column for each CDROM and DVD player in the system in
<code class="filename">info</code> (not just SCSI devices). 
</p><p>
As an
example, the auto eject feature can be turned on by the superuser with
the command <span class="command"><strong>echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/autoeject</strong></span>.
This will cause cdroms to be ejected from the drive when unmounted.

Many Linux users have no SCSI devices (or adapters) in their systems. They
become a little perplexed as to why cd writer software (e.g. 
<span class="command"><strong>cdrecord</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>cdrdao</strong></span>)
and cd music reading programs (e.g. <span class="command"><strong>cdparanoia</strong></span>) use
the Linux SCSI subsystem. The answer is that these programs need lower level
access to these devices. ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) is essentially
a SCSI command set sent over an ATA 
<a href="#ftn.idm489" class="footnote" name="idm489"><sup class="footnote">[10]</sup></a>
transport. [The discussion in this section is also applicable to ATAPI
tape drives and ATAPI floppy drives.]
</p><p>
Currently both <span class="command"><strong>cdrecord</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>cdparanoia</strong></span>
interface to the SCSI generic driver (sg) and, in the case of ATAPI 
cd devices, use the ide-scsi pseudo device driver to access the hardware.
This may change in the future as in the 2.4 series kernels a packet
interface ioctl has been added to the uniform cdrom layer (see the diagram
in <a class="xref" href="ch09s02.html" title="2. CDROM driver (sr or scd)">Section 2, &#8220;CDROM driver (sr or scd)&#8221;</a> above).
<a href="#ftn.idm495" class="footnote" name="idm495"><sup class="footnote">[11]</sup></a>
</p><p>
The default action of the IDE subsystem in Linux is to claim all ATA
devices for its built-in drivers. In the case of an ATAPI cd writer, it 
will be claimed by the built-in ide-cd driver. Once this has happened, 
the SCSI subsystem is unable to get control over an ATAPI device. The 
ide-scsi (pseudo lower level SCSI) driver can only register ATAPI devices 
in the SCSI subsystem that have <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> already been 
claimed by the IDE subsystem.
</p><p>
Notice the <span class="emphasis"><em>built-in</em></span> qualification in the previous 
paragraph. If both the ide-cd and ide-scsi drivers are modules then the 
first one loaded will claim the ATAPI cd devices (e.g. cd/dvd readers and 
writers). Furthermore you can switch the controlling driver module by 
<span class="command"><strong>rmmod</strong></span>-ing one and <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span>-ing the 
other.
</p><p>
Probably the most flexible way to instruct the IDE core driver that you
want the cd writer at <code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code> accessible to
<span class="command"><strong>cdrecord</strong></span> is to use the kernel boot option: 
"hdd=ide-scsi". This will cause the ide-cd driver to bypass 
<code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code> (irrespective of whether ide-cd driver is 
built-in or a module). As long as the ide-scsi driver is built-in or a 
module then it will "capture" the cd writer
at <code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code> (with the IDE core driver loading the
ide-scsi module if required).
</p><p>
The ide-cd driver module can be instructed to ignore certain ATA devices
with the following syntax:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
modprobe ide-cd ignore='hdc hdd'
</pre><p>
In this case the ide-cd driver will ignore the devices at 
<code class="filename">/dev/hdc</code> and <code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code> .
This effect can also be accomplished by placing a line like this: 
"options ide-cd ignore=hdd" in the <code class="filename">/etc/modules.conf</code> 
file.
</p><p>
A new option added in the lk 2.4 series is of the form "hdd=scsi".
This option seems to have a similar function to the "hdd=ide-scsi"
option discussed above. Furthermore "hdd=scsi" can only be used if
both the SCSI mid-level and the ide-scsi drivers are built into the
kernel (otherwise "BAD OPTION" is reported by the ide_setup function).
</p><p>
To find out whether an ATAPI cd device is "owned" by the SCSI subsystem, 
the output of <span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/scsi/scsi</strong></span> can be checked. 
Another technique is to observe the "drive name:" line of
<span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info</strong></span> for "sr" entries. The
following output is from my system:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info

Once an ATAPI cd writer at /dev/hdd has been registered by the SCSI
subsystem, then cdroms should be mounted via the "scd" device name
and cd players should also use the "scd" device. Strangely the
<span class="command"><strong>hdparm</strong></span> command should still use the <code class="filename">
/dev/hdd</code> device file (or the "echo ... &gt; /proc/ide/hdd/settings"
method described in this <a class="link" href="ch10s01.html#idescsi">section</a>).

ATA is the modern name for what was previously known as IDE and/or EIDE.
Note that the subsystem that controls ATA devices in Linux is called
the "IDE" subsystem for historical reasons.
</p></div><div id="ftn.idm495" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm495" class="para"><sup class="para">[11] </sup></a>
Other ATA devices such as tapes and floppies often use the ATAPI interface. 
However, the vast majority of ATA disks do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> use
the ATAPI interface.
</p></div><div id="ftn.idm523" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm523" class="para"><sup class="para">[12] </sup></a>
In the linux 2.4 kernel series there has been an increase in problems when
the ide-scsi driver is used so that <span class="command"><strong>cdrecord</strong></span> can control
ATAPI (IDE) cd writers. The problem may be related to the aggressive manner 
in which the IDE subsystem attempts to optimize the speed of data transfers 
on devices it controls. Some people experiencing timeouts and machine lockups 
have found that reducing the DMA setting via the <span class="command"><strong>hdparm</strong></span>
command has fixed the problem. If the cd writer is connected to 
<code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code> then users have reported success with one of
these two commands: 
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    hdparm -d0 -c1 /dev/hdd 
    hdparm -d 1 -X 34 /dev/hdd 
</pre><p>
The first one turns off DMA completely while the second one sets it in
"multiword DMA mode 2". Cd writers do not need the types of speeds that 
modern disks utilize. Even burning at "x16" implies a sustained transfer 
rate of 16 times 150 KB/sec which is approximately 2.4 MB/sec, not
really that fast. There has also been a report that moving a cd writer off
a high speed IDE controller (Promise) and back to the motherboard's lower 
speed IDE controllers has fixed a random IDE bus reset problem. Another 
report suggests reducing (or turning off) the DMA on the IDE hard disk can 
also stop lockups.
