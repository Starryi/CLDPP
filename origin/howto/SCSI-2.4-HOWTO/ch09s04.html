All types of SCSI devices are accessible via the sg driver. This means
devices such as CDROM drives can be accessed both via the sr and sg
drivers. Other SCSI devices such as scanners can only be accessed
via the sg driver.
The sg driver is capable of recognizing 256 SCSI devices. Any number of
devices (up to the overall limit of 256) can be added after the sg
driver is loaded.
</p><p>
See reference <a class="link" href="apf.html#W4">W4</a> for the SCSI Generic (sg) driver
documentation (also found there is the sg_utils package). 
For SCSI standards see reference <a class="link" href="apf.html#W1">W1</a> and for a
book on the subject of SCSI programming and pass through mechanisms see
reference <a class="link" href="apf.html#B3">B3</a>.

The sg driver in lk 2.4 is "version 3" which adds an additional interface
structure and some new ioctl()s. The most interesting new ioctl()
is SG_IO which sends a SCSI command and waits for its response. 
See the Linux Documentation Project site:
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SCSI-Generic-HOWTO/" target="_top">
<code class="literal">www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SCSI-Generic-HOWTO/</code></a> 
for a full description of the sg driver.
A (possibly later) version of this document can be found at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.torque.net/sg/p/sg_v3_ho.html" target="_top">
<code class="literal">www.torque.net/sg/p/sg_v3_ho.html</code></a>.
</p><p>
The abbreviation "sg" is used within the kernel to refer both to the
SCSI generic driver and the scatter-gather capability offered by many
modern IO devices (usually associated with DMA). The context usually
makes it clear which one is being referred to. As an example, note the
contorted sg ioctl() named SG_GET_SG_TABLESIZE where the second "SG"
refers to scatter gather.
</p><p>
The public interface for sg is found in the file: <code class="filename">
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h</code>. Depending on the distribution
this may or may not contain the same information as <code class="filename">
/usr/include/scsi/sg.h</code> which is controlled by the GNU library
maintainers. If these 2 files are not the same use the former header
file. Those writing applications based on sg should see its documentation
for more on this matter.
</p><p>
The sg driver registers all SCSI devices (with a current maximum of 256)
as they are seen. Each newly registered SCSI device gets allocated the
next available minor device number. At least initially this will be the
same sequence that devices are displayed in mid level's <span class="command"><strong>
cat /proc/scsi/scsi</strong></span>. The sg devices device mapping can be
seen with <span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/scsi/sg/devices</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>
cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_strs</strong></span>. Differences between
<span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/scsi/scsi</strong></span> and sg orderings will appear when
a low level driver is removed (e.g. <span class="command"><strong>rmmod aha1542</strong></span>) or
when a device is removed with remove-single-device.
The sg driver will leave remaining SCSI device mapping to minor device
numbers unchanged. This potentially leaves a "hole" in the sg mapping.
An example follows:

Notice how the sg driver maintains the row positions of the remaining
devices in the "device_strs" output. So when the Pioneer
dvd player is removed, a hole opens up in the sg device mapping
which is not reflected in the <span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/scsi/scsi</strong></span>
output. That "hole" corresponds to the device name <code class="filename">
/dev/sg1</code>.
</p><p>
The new sg_io_hdr interface includes a data transfer residual count
field called "resid". Only some lower level adapters support this
feature and those that don't always yield zero in this field. At
the time of writing the advansys, aha152x and the sym53c8xx
drivers support this feature.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sgbparams"></a>4.1. sg boot parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
The sg driver maintains a reserved buffer for each open file descriptor.
The purpose is to guarantee applications that data transfers up to the
size of the reserved buffer will not fail for lack of kernel memory. This
is important for applications like cdrecord that cannot easily recover
(the CDR) from a ENOMEM error.
</p><p>
In the absence of the boot parameter 'sg_def_reserved_size' or the sg module
parameter 'def_reserved_size', then each time a sg file descriptor is opened
the reserved buffer size is inherited from SG_DEF_RESERVED_SIZE which is
defined in <code class="filename">include/linux/sg.h</code>.
</p><p>
The SG_DEF_RESERVED_SIZE define value can be overridden by this kernel boot
option:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    sg_def_reserved_size=&lt;n&gt;
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sgmparams"></a>4.2. sg module parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
When the sg module is loaded the SG_DEF_RESERVED_SIZE define value can be
overridden by supplying this option:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    def_reserved_size=&lt;n&gt;
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sgproc"></a>4.3. sg proc interface</h3></div></div></div><p>
All the following files are readable by all and produce ASCII output
when read. The file
'def_reserved_size' is also writable by root. The ASCII output has been
formatted in such a way as to be human and machine readable (and hence
a compromise). Use Unix commands of the form <span class="command"><strong>cat device_hdrs devices
</strong></span> to see the output of tables.
</p><pre class="programlisting">

/proc/scsi/sg/debug       [internal state of sg driver]

All the above files are owned by root and readable by all while
<code class="filename">def_reserved_size</code> is writable by root. For the
<code class="filename">devices</code> and <code class="filename">device_strs</code> files
the first row output corresponds to <code class="filename">/dev/sg0</code>
(sg minor device number 0). The second row output corresponds to
<code class="filename">/dev/sg1</code>, etc.
For the <code class="filename">hosts</code> and <code class="filename">host_strs</code>
files the first row output corresponds to host (adapter number) 0, etc.
For numeric tables a missing device or host is indicated by a row
of "-1" values. For string tables a missing device or host is indicated
by a row containing "&lt;no active device/host&gt;".
