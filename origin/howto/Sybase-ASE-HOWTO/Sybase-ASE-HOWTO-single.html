Sybase ASE / SQL Server is an industry-strength high-performance database solution used by some of the largest corporations worldwide. It is also, in my personal opinion, one of the easiest database servers to learn and to work with. It has a wide range of extremely advanced options, probably the most advanced replication in the market, and a set of various add-on products that will even support opaque access of data from competing products. There is a Linux version available for download which is free even for production use. Sharing a common heritage with Microsoft SQL Server (Sybase sold the code to Microsoft, but the T-SQL dialect remains almost the same in both products), Sybase ASE is the easiest way of getting "MS SQL on Linux". Having said that, you may also understand by now that Sybase ASE could deserve the label "the best-kept secret in the market". Welcome to a free helping of a commercial database server that basically runs most of Wall Street and stock exchanges around the world - now on your home PC or business server.

There are some parts I have skipped since this is a HOWTO for installation, configuration and very basic usage. Some points that could be of interest are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm46"></a>1.4. History</h3></div></div></div><p>
Sybase started as a company in 1984, making a relational database management system (RDBMS) called SQL Server. At version 4.9.2, Microsoft licensed the code and released their SQL Server 6.0. Sybase version-inflated their next version to "System X". The product has been enhanced and improved over the years, it was first released on Linux with a pilot of version 11.0.3.3  which was already a mature version on it's way out at the time of release in 1999. The product was renamed from SQL Server to Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) when version 11.5 was released, the name is a bit of a mouthful and some users simply refer to it as "ace". Later, version 11.9.2 was released both as a free developer version and a fully supported production version on Linux. Currently Linux is considered a tier-1 platform and the current version as of this writing, 12.5.0.x, as well as the beta release of the next version, 12.5.1, are available for the Linux OS.
</p><p>
A brief note about the version numbering. Sybase patches are called EBFs, or Emergency Bug Fixes, and each has a unique number (product number) for that particular set of fixes on each particular architecture. Since this made comparing the various bug fixes across OS platforms difficult, the notation of ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) was introduced. So for a major release (Maintenance Release) 12.5.0.0 there were some EBFs numbered ESD#1, ESD#2 and so on, until a minor release with significant enhancements (Interim Release) numbered 12.5.0.1 and then further EBFs are based on this. If a Linux machine and a Solaris machine both run 12.5.0.3 ESD #1, you know they will have exactly the same bugfixes corrected even if the EBF product number of course differs.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm50"></a>1.5. Availability</h3></div></div></div><p>
I have briefly mentioned the available versions. You can download the free versions from <a class="ulink" href="http://linux.sybase.com" target="_top">http://linux.sybase.com</a>, and if you need a production server with support etc. you can order a boxed CD from your local Sybase office or <a class="ulink" href="http://eshop.sybase.com" target="_top">http://eshop.sybase.com</a>.
</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
SQL Server 11.0.3.3 ESD #6 is no longer supported or maintained. The reason it is still made available is that it is free for production use on Linux. Read the license file shipped with the product for details. The 11.0.3 versions are the earliest that were Y2K-certified.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
ASE 11.9.2.x was the first release on Linux where you could get either a free developer license or buy support. It is no longer actively maintained or supported. I describe it in this document since it was the first production use supported release for Linux and hence became very popular.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
ASE 12.5.0.x is the current release on all platforms, including Linux.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
ASE 12.5.1 is the next release, currently in beta. There is a beta for Linux available.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
The functionality varies in the releases, certain significant enhancements have been made in the current versions. However, major corporations based their infrastructure on SQL Server 11.0.x until very recently (and some of them may have old installations still very active) so don't think of it as outdated.
Some of the new enhancements may be of interest to you, others will only sooth your pain if you were annoyed by the lack of them over a period of time first.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="install"></a>2. Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>
The different versions of ASE for Linux that are available have slightly different installation and configuration procedures. The installation documents that come with the product are quite detailed so I will instead try to focus on some alternatives in order to avoid common problems. In particular, I will describe how to install without RPM since the RPM utility is a functionality unique to Linux and most Sybase DBAs with background from other types of UNIX prefer to avoid this format and use the traditional installation instead. However, I will also describe how you can play it safer when using RPM.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm69"></a>2.1. Super-quick RPM installation for the impatient</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you are just doing a test, simply install the <code class="filename">sybase-common</code> and <code class="filename">sybase-ase</code> RPMs using <span class="command"><strong>rpm -ihv</strong></span> as root. The installation should then create a sybase user and start the configuration scripts automatically. For version 11.0.3.3, only the <code class="filename">sybase-ase</code> package is needed.
</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ su - root
Password:
bash# rpm -ihv sybase-common-12.5-1.rpm sybase-ase-12.5-1.rpm
</pre><p>
I strongly recommend that you read through any text files shipped with the software (<code class="filename">README</code> for instance), and also the documents "Release Bulletin" and "Installation Guide" available on the Sybase documentation website (also known as SyBooks). These will contain lots of important information, and I have attempted to avoid duplication of those efforts as much as possible.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm78"></a>2.2. Pre-install Steps For All Installations</h3></div></div></div><p>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
The first thing to check is whether your Linux installation is able to run the version of ASE you have selected. The RPM utility will attempt to check this during installation, but you can check the dependencies in advance with <span class="command"><strong>rpm -qRp &lt;package&gt;</strong></span>. RPM will check against the RPM database of installed products on your machine, if these have lower version numbers than the requirements you will get an error message and it is first necessary to update these packages to be able to install. Note that you will also get an error if the package name is not found in the RPM database. This can happen if you installed software without using RPM (e.g. compiled from source, not SRPMs) or the package has a different name from what the ASE packages list as dependencies (e.g. RedHat places the Linux kernel in a package named "kernel", SuSE uses k_deflt for the default kernel and other names for other supplied kernels such as k_smp). You can then check the kernel version with <span class="command"><strong>uname -r</strong></span> and the glibc version will most likely be what is reported by <span class="command"><strong>ldd --version</strong></span>, but also do <span class="command"><strong>ls -l /lib/</strong></span> and check the actual filenames that the symlinks <code class="filename">/lib/libc.so</code>, <code class="filename">/lib/libpthread.so</code> and <code class="filename">/lib/librt.so</code> link to.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a name="cert"></a>Certified OS levels</h3><p>
The distribution Sybase has chosen to certify on is RedHat. For installation of 11.0.3.3 or 11.9.2 you can probably use any distribution, for the newer enterprise features of 12.5.0.x you will have to check exactly which distribution is certified and only use that particular Linux distribution and release level. Don't expect anything else than the certified OS level to work. The installation document lists the minimum required kernel and glibc versions.</p></div><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Glibc-specific issues</h3><p>
There are some known issues with glibc that cause serious problems with ASE. Basically, you will see this as a Segmentation Fault when starting the server (the error log will say something about process infected with signal 11 and then dump out a stack trace.). These problems are seen above version 12.5.0.1 on any uncertified platform, including currently RedHat 9.0. You must use a certified Linux distribution and version (RedHat 7.2, RedHat Advanced Server 2.1) and make sure the proper fixes are in the i686 glibc libraries (update them from RedHat Network). In particular, at the time of this writing the current ASE version (12.5.0.3) does not work on the current RedHat version (9.0) - nor on the beta of the next Enterprise Server (3.0) due to glibc issues! RedHat is working on this, and the release of Enterprise Server should be in order. See RedHat bugs 90002 and 102995 as well as the research done by Sybase under CR 326398. Hopefully this will eventually trickle up to the FSF/GNU distribution point for glibc and then to the various other distributions.
</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Check the available disk space. You will initially need space for installing the binaries and for installing the system databases. This is listed in the Installation Guide, but you will need additional space for the databases you create and you will have to make some estimates of how much you need for this.
</p><div class="table"><a name="idm99"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Default Installation Directory</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" summary="Default Installation Directory" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left" class="col1"><col align="left" class="col2"><col align="left" class="col3"><col align="left" class="col4"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Version</th><th align="left">Minimum RAM Dedicated to ASE</th><th align="left">Application Disk Space</th><th align="left">System Database Devices</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">11.0.3.3</td><td align="left">&#732;15 MB</td><td align="left">110 MB</td><td align="left">17 MB master 12 MB sysprocsdev</td></tr><tr><td align="left">11.9.2.x</td><td align="left">&#732;32 MB</td><td align="left">140 MB</td><td align="left">25 MB master 45 MB sysprocsdev</td></tr><tr><td align="left">12.5.0.x</td><td align="left">&#732;50 MB</td><td align="left">215 MB</td><td align="left">30 MB master 100 MB sysprocsdev</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><br class="table-break">

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
After checking that ASE can be installed, create the sybase user group and then the sybase user as a member of it. This is an ordinary user that will be used mainly for starting the database server, so the user has to own all the ASE-related files. I suggest you keep the home directory of this user together with the home directories of other normal users, instead of using the installation directory of the ASE software as a home directory. Use <span class="command"><strong>adduser</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>useradd</strong></span> or whatever GUI utility your distribution provides you with.
</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ su - root
bash# groupadd sybase
bash# useradd -g sybase -d /home/sybase -c "Sybase ASE DBA account" -p Hard2Guess sybase
</pre><p>
The installation scripts will not attempt to create the user if you have done so yourself first.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
Once these steps are done, we are ready to unload the software onto the base directory that ASE will be installed in. By default, the RPM packages are configured to place this under <code class="filename">/opt/<em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;sybase-directory&gt;</code></em></code> where &lt;sybase-directory&gt; is:
</p><div class="table"><a name="idm136"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. Default Installation Directory</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" summary="Default Installation Directory" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left" class="col1"><col align="left" class="col2"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Version</th><th align="left">Directory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">11.0.3.3</td><td align="left">/opt/sybase/</td></tr><tr><td align="left">11.9.2.x</td><td align="left">/opt/sybase-11.9.2/</td></tr><tr><td align="left">12.5.0.x</td><td align="left">/opt/sybase-12.5/</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><br class="table-break">

You can choose a different location if you like, either with the <em class="parameter"><code>--relocate</code></em> parameter to <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span>, or by unpacking to a different directory if you are converting to .tgz file first. Again, I recommend keeping a normal home directory for the sybase user, a directory for the ASE software and a third location for the database storage.

After preparing the environment, it is time to write the software to disk. You can either install with RPM or convert the RPM packages to another format first. These options will be covered here, and why you would want to choose one or the other.

So, why is RPM bad? Well, as long as you install the latest ASE patches on the latest working RedHat version with the latest patches you may not have a lot of problems. However, you may also find that the RPM installations will cause the following problems depending on exactly which version of ASE (or EBFs) you are installing on which RedHat version (or other distribution).
</p><p>
</p><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><b>Known Problems with RPM and Their Workarounds</b></p><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
   <span class="bold"><strong>Problem:</strong></span> RPM installation of ASE or applying EBFs will truncate the <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file.
</span></dt><dd><p>
   <span class="bold"><strong>Symptom:</strong></span> After RPM installation of ASE if will truncate your <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file to 0 bytes, making your OS installation forget where shared libraries are found. This may affect X, sshd and several others.

<span class="bold"><strong>Caused by:</strong></span> the post-install scripts. You can view them with <span class="command"><strong>rpm -qp -scripts <em class="parameter"><code>&lt;package&gt;</code></em></strong></span>. They try to use a varaible named <code class="varname">$RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> which is apparently not set by newer versions of the RPM utility.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Kludge 1:</strong></span> first copy all the files that will be destroyed by the installation. <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code>, <code class="filename">.profile</code> and <code class="filename">.cshrc</code> for the sybase user should be copied to a safe place before installing. Then install as per the Sybase instructions and copy the files back when you are done. When the correct <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> is in place, run <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig</strong></span> as root.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Kludge 2:</strong></span> First set the <code class="varname">$RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> to the top-level directory where the ASE files are to be installed (what will become <code class="varname">$SYBASE</code>).
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Kludge 3:</strong></span> Make RPM install without running the scripts; <span class="command"><strong>rpm -ihv --noscripts</strong></span>

Unless the above problem descriptions scared you, you may want to use RPM with a few extra modifications. Instead of letting RPM try to be helpful but end up causing trouble, we will disable the friendly attempts and have to do some manual corrections ourselves afterwards.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm224"></a>2.4.1. The Manual RPM Installation</h4></div></div></div><p>
Just to be on the safe side, we first copy out the files that are at risk; <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code>, <code class="filename">&lt;sybase user home&gt;/.profile</code> and <code class="filename">&lt;sybase user home&gt;/.cshrc</code>.
The switches I have chosen to add are:
</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>--relocate</td></tr><tr><td>--nodeps</td></tr><tr><td>--noscripts</td></tr></table><p>
Now, mount the CD or download the files with FTP and <span class="command"><strong>cd</strong></span> to this directory. As root, install the files with:
</p><pre class="screen">
<span class="command"><strong>rpm -ihv --relocate /opt/sybase-12.5=/opt/sybase --nodeps --noscripts sybase-common* sybase-ase*</strong></span>

A couple of common utilities for installing without RPM are rpm2tgz and alien. You can use any of these to first convert into a tgz package and then unpack the files without running any of the RPM scripts. The distribuiton of the RPM utility also ships with a program called rpm2cpio which will convert to a cpio archive.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
alien: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/" target="_top">http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/</a>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
rpm2tgz: This is apparently the name of a utility shipped with Slackware and TurboLinux. The TurboLinux files indicate that it is simply a wrapper for rpm2cpio and cpio2tgz, the latter of these will actually unpack the cpio archive into a temporary directory and repack it as tgz.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
rpm2cpio: This is part of the RedHat Package Manager (RPM) distribution so it should be installed if you have rpm installed. You will need cpio together with it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
The alien utility can either unpack the rpm using <span class="command"><strong>alien -g</strong></span>, or you can create a tgz archive with <span class="command"><strong>alien -t</strong></span>.
</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ su -
Password:
bash# alien -t sybase-ase*.rpm sybas-common*.rpm
sybase-common-12.5.tgz generated
sybase-ase-12.5.tgz generated
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The rpm2tgz utility does the same thing, converts the rpm into a tgz archive.
</p><pre class="screen">
rpm2tgz sybase-ase*.rpm
rpm2tgz sybase-common*.rpm
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The distribution of RPM contains the rpm2cpio utility, it reads an rpm from a file or STDIN and outputs a cpio archive on STDOUT.
</p><pre class="screen">
rpm2cpio sybase-ase-12.5-3.i386.rpm &gt; sybase-ase-12.5-3.i386.cpio
rpm2cpio sybase-common-12.5-3.i386.rpm &gt; sybase-common-12.5-3.i386.cpio
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Once you have created a .tgz archive from the RPM, you can unpack it. Since the path in the archive is relative to /, you need to do this as root.
</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ su -
Password:
bash# tar -xvzf sybase-ase*.tgz
bash# tar -xvzf sybase-common*.tgz

For a cpio archive, unpack it with the cpio command:

There are some useful steps done by the installation scripts in the RPM packages that you may want to do by hand if you installed with extra RPM switches or used alien. One is that directories in ASE 12.5 get shortcuts created with shorter names. ASE-12_5 gets a symlink named ASE, OCS-12_5 has a symlink named OCS. You can set these up yourself to save some typing later.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm369"></a>3.2. Preparing the Data Area</h3></div></div></div><p>
Since the file system for the software is now prepared, we can decide where to locate the data storage used to hold the data inserted into the databases. The first decision is whether to use raw devices or file system. Traditionally, raw devices were used. You had to partition a disk and set a certain label to have it recognized as raw. Linux didn't have this previously and the Sybase virtual devices were instead written to files in a file system.
</p><p>
So, what is the difference between these approaches and when should you choose each? Unfortunately, it is one of the areas where the answer is a very clear and unambiguos "it depends". Raw devices were introduced first with kernel patches and then included in the 2.4 series. You use the command <span class="command"><strong>raw</strong></span> to create bindings between partitions and the <code class="filename">/dev/raw<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></code> devices. This means that you will need to have a free partition on a disk. Changing this later can also be difficult. The advantages of raw devices are that you know exactly where on disk they are located - you can place them on the fastest cylinders if you like. Writes to the raw devices will be unbuffered, they will go directly to disk. In case of a failure (such as power outage, disk controller failure or process crash) the finished writes are guaranteed to be on disk instead of only having been written to a buffer waiting for the disk to be ready. Also, the ASE server will to asynchronous I/O on these devices. It can queue a series of I/O instead of having to do a single I/O, wait for it to finish and then do the next operation. While the I/O result is pending, the ASE server will perform other work. With a virtual device written to a file on a file system (ext2, ext3 and Reiserfs are all supported), the writes will normally be done to the file system buffers. The actual file may be located anywhere on the partition and may not be contiguous. Note that there is no need for a journalling file system since these will only log the changes to the inode, not the contents of the data blocks. The Sybase ASE transaction log will do exactly this kind of "journalling" of the data modifications for you. The buffering means that reading data not held in ASE cache may take place from the file system buffer instead of having to read it from disk, thereby speeding up these. However, writes will probably take longer time to finish since they have to pass through the file system driver layer. In order to have safe writes to file system devices you can configure ASE to open the device using the O_DSYNC flag, which will cause writes to be flushed to disc immediately when writing.
</p><p>
In ASE 11.0.3.3 ESD #6 there is support for raw devices. This will need certain patches shipped in the GPL directory, one for raw device access, one for KAIO. There are instructions for how to apply these to the kernels and distributions that were current at the time.
</p><p>
In 11.9.2.x it was decided not to include any experimental raw device support before the Linux kernel officially included and supported this. In order to guarantee safe writes, the O_DSYNC flag is always enabled by default. You can globally disable this with traceflag 1625; add -T1625 as a parameter to the RUN_SERVER file.
</p><p>
In ASE 12.5.0.x there was a change starting in 12.5.0.2 where the server is now compiled to use the kernel 2.4 functionality. That means you can create raw devices on OS level and configure ASE to use these without any special patches. If you prefer file system devices, you can set the O_DSYNC flag to be used with the <em class="parameter"><code>dsync=true</code></em> parameter when creating the device with <span class="command"><strong>disk init</strong></span>, or the <span class="command"><strong>sp_deviceattr</strong></span> stored procedure to modify it later.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm382"></a>3.3. Starting the Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>
To configure a SQL Server 11.0.3.3 you log in as the sybase user and start the <span class="command"><strong>sybinit</strong></span> utility. You can run this in a console, make changes and hit <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keysym">A</span> for "accept" and <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keysym">X</span> to go back to the previous menu.
</p><p>
In ASE 11.9.2.x and 12.5.0.x, you normally use the <span class="command"><strong>srvbuild</strong></span> command, but you will need an X server to display it. For those not using X, an option is to use the shell script "sybinit4ever", available on the web from SyPron, see the 3rd party utilities section later. This will give you a classic sybinit menu interface to the configuration process. An alternative from Sybase is the <span class="command"><strong>srvbuildres</strong></span> utility which uses a resource file containing all configuration options which you can edit with your settings, these options are  described in an appendix of the Installation Guide. 
</p><p>
The exact entries for configuring a server are described in more detail in the /opt/sybase/doc/howto/howto-ase-quickstart.html file from the ASE 11.0.3.3 documentation RPM, and in the "Configuration Guide for UNIX" for the newer versions. The information you will need for all versions are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
IP address of the interface which ASE will listen on. Use the network IP of the machine or 127.0.0.1 if you are only going to accept local connections.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
TCP port which ASE will listen on. Choose any port not in use. Port 2025 was used before, 4100 is the current default. Use 1433 if you are trying to trick applications into believing this is an MS SQL Server.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Path to the master device (raw device or file).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Path to the sybsystemprocs device (raw device or file).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Character set and sort order for your data (you want to get this right the first time, changing it later involves copying all data out to files and load them back in). ISO_1 character set should be sufficient for most purposes. Unicode is only supported in the 12.5.0.x releases.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Logical server name - this is just a placeholder to identify an ASE instance. In the examples I have named the server SYBASE.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Once you have decided on these settings, start the configuration program. If you use <span class="command"><strong>srvbuild</strong></span>, you will need to set your $DISPLAY variable correctly. Type in the requested settings and let the configuration utility build the server. Some parts of this, such as creating the database devices and loading the system stored procedures, will take time. Once the process has finished, you server should have been built and be up and running, ready for requests.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm411"></a>3.4. Finishing Off</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you want automatic startup and shutdown, consider the rc.sybase script a good start. You can copy this to where all your other startup scripts are and create the correct start and stop links from your runlevel directories.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="usage"></a>4. Basic Usage</h2></div></div></div><p>
The intention behind this section is to allow you to get started with the Sybase-specific parts quickly. You will still need to know a little bit about relational databases, creating tables, designing the database and so on. You will see how to start and stop the server, execute commands and a little bit about backups.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm417"></a>4.1. Starting and Stopping the Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
Starting the server is done with the <span class="command"><strong>startserver</strong></span> utility. During installation a script file was created named <code class="filename">RUN_</code> and then the name of the server. Since the file name will vary with your server name, it is generally referred to as the <code class="filename">RUN_SERVER</code> file. To start your server, make sure all environment variables (in particular <code class="varname">$SYBASE</code>) are set correctly. Check with <span class="command"><strong>showserver</strong></span> that the server is not already running -  there is no risk of starting the server twice, but you may get some confusing error messages about the master device already being in use. Assuming the server is not started, execute the following: <span class="command"><strong>startserver -f RUN_SYBASE</strong></span>Assuming that you named your server "SYBASE" at install time, this should make various messages starting with a timestamp scroll over your screen and hopefully end with messages about the default character set and sort order. If not, read the messages carefully for any errors. If they have scrolled out of your screen buffer you can read the error log file instead, located in the same directory as the <code class="filename">RUN_SERVER</code> file. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm427"></a>4.2. Connecting to the Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
Once the server is up and running, you can attempt to connect to it. Start with the simplest tool, which is also the traditional utility for Sybase administration and use; <span class="command"><strong>isql</strong></span>. It takes many parameters, as listed in the Utility Guide, but we only need a few. Make your first connection like this: <span class="command"><strong>isql -Usa -P -S<em class="replaceable"><code>server</code></em></strong></span>Replace the <em class="parameter"><code>-S</code></em> parameter with your logical server name that you chose during installation.
</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Remember to change the blank sa password</h3><p>
The <em class="parameter"><code>-U</code></em> parameter is the login name, we are here logging in as "<span class="emphasis"><em>sa</em></span>" the Sybase equivalent of "<span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span>". The password specified with the <em class="parameter"><code>-P</code></em> parameter is blank, which is the default password for this user. It should be fairly obvious that you don't want to leave your most powerful login with a blank password. Note that the ASE logins are independent from the OS logins and passwords.</p></div><p>
The result should be a simple prompt:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">1&gt;</pre><p>
</p><p>If the connection did not succeed, make sure the server is running and that the port is reported by <span class="command"><strong>netstat -na</strong></span> to have a LISTENING state. </p><p>
You can now start typing T-SQL commands and use the keyword "<span class="command"><strong>go</strong></span>" as a terminator.

The first thing to do is to set a password for "sa" and then create a new login with less privileges that we can use to play around with. By default you are placed in the <code class="filename">master</code> database once you are logged in. We will make our new login default to an example database instead to avoid creating objects in the master database by mistake. So, we first set a password for sa by calling the stored procedure <span class="command"><strong>sp_password</strong></span> with old and new passwords as parameters:
</p><pre class="screen">
1&gt; exec sp_password NULL, "Secr3t"
2&gt; go
Password correctly set.
(return status = 0)
</pre><p>
Now sa has a new password, changed from the old null default. We add a new login with <span class="command"><strong>sp_addlogin</strong></span>:
</p><pre class="screen">
1&gt; exec sp_addlogin "sybtest", "SomePass"
2&gt; go
Password correctly set.
Account unlocked.
New login created.
(return status = 0)
</pre><p>
We can log out by telling isql to disconnect using the <span class="command"><strong>exit</strong></span> command.
</p><pre class="screen">
1&gt; exit
</pre><p>
Since this is not a T-SQL command but a directive to isql we don't need to terminate with "go".
</p><p>
The <span class="command"><strong>isql</strong></span> command can also be used non-interactively to apply scripts of T-SQL to the server. One such script that is shipped with the server is <code class="filename">installpubs2</code>, located in the scripts directory. This is a very simple example database for a bookshop or a publishing house holding data about books, authors, publishers and so on. It is used in Sybase manuals and training courses and also in some SQL books. Microsoft SQL Server contains a similar database in addition to the Northwind example database they have added. In order to create the database, use the <em class="parameter"><code>-i</code></em> parameter to read the script in. Have a look at the file first so you understand the basics of what it is doing; it will create a database named pubs2 and several tables populated with data. It is time to execute the script. We'll do this as sa who will also become the owner (dbo - database owner ) of the database. We redirect the output to a file we call <code class="filename">errors.out</code>. The <em class="parameter"><code>-e</code></em> parameter tells isql to also echo the T-SQL commands to the same file, giving more output but making it easier to match any errors to the commands causing them.
</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ cd $SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/scripts
bash$ isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE -iinstallpubs2 -e -oerrors.out
</pre><p>
In order to allow our new login full privileges to this sample database we change ownership of the database to the new login. Here's how we give the database away with <span class="command"><strong>sp_changedbowner</strong></span>:
</p><pre class="screen">
isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE
1&gt; use pubs2
2&gt; go
1&gt; exec sp_changedbowner sybtest
2&gt; go
DBCC execution completed. If DBCC printed error messages, contact a user with
System Administrator (SA) role.
Database owner changed.
(return status = 0)
</pre><p>
We can now log in interactively as our new user and check what has been installed.
</p><pre class="screen">
1&gt; exit
bash$ isql -Usybtest -PSomePass -SSYBASE
1&gt; use pubs2
2&gt; go
1&gt; sp_help
2&gt; go
[Lots of output deleted - the command displays all objects in the current database]
</pre><p>
(Note that we don't actually have to use "exec" to execute a stored procedure, the server will assume any non-keyword is a procedure.)
</p><pre class="screen">
1&gt; quit
</pre><p>
One last command as the sa login in order to make life more convenient when we continue to use our new login - we make the new pubs2 database the default database.
</p><pre class="screen">
1&gt; exit
bash$ isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE
1&gt; sp_modifylogin sybtest, "defdb", "pubs2"
2&gt; go

(return status = 0)
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm471"></a>4.4. Stopping the Server</h3></div></div></div><p>
In order to stop the server in a controlled fashion, log in as sa and issue the <span class="command"><strong>shutdown</strong></span> command.
</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE
1&gt; shutdown
2&gt; go
Server SHUTDOWN by request.

CT-LIBRARY error:

</pre><p>
You will immediately be disconnected and a message is printed by isql to warn you of this fact. You can check the error log for a message about the server being shutdown and you can verify that the process is no longer running with <span class="command"><strong>showserver</strong></span>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm477"></a>4.5. Maintenance</h3></div></div></div><p>
One of the most important aspects of being a database administrator may be the backup. The I/O load of a relational database means little rest for the hard drives and once a drive fails the database is in need of serious disaster recovery. Even a mistyped command may result in the need to revert to a previous backup generation. For this purpose, a separate server application called the Backup Server is used. It is by default named the same as your server with an extension of BCK. Start it with <span class="command"><strong>startserver -f RUN_SYBASE_BCK</strong></span>. Certain commands typed into the isql propmt will be forwarded from the <code class="filename">dataserver</code> process to the <code class="filename">backupserver</code> process, which will then proceed with the actual backup (in Sybase terminology, this is a database dump) while processing in the database continues unaffected. You should schedule database dumps (usually via cron) to run at low activity hours. A typical full database bacup is simply done like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE

You can restore this back into your database using the load database command.
</p><p>
As time passes while users are doing modifications in the database, adding, deleting or changing data, all operations are being written to the transaction log. This keeps track of changes so they can be undone by an implicit or explicit rollback, or for the undo/redo phases of revocery at startup. This transaction log should normally be placed on a device of its own for several reasons, but a small test database can be created on a single mixed log and data device.
</p><p>
Apart from the performance benefits of spreading I/O, one reason for keeping the log and data separate is for recovery purposes. You can at regular intervals, depending upon your recovery needs, dump this log of changes to the database. Together with the full database dump, this transaction log dump now constitute an incremental backup. Should a restore become necessary, you can load the database dump, then load all subsequent transaction log dumps. There is even an "until_time" option to the load command enabling you to specify the exact time you want to restore until, abandoning any mistakes done after that time. Dumping the log is done with a similar syntax:
</p><pre class="screen">
isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE
1&gt; dump transaction <em class="parameter"><code>database</code></em> to "/mnt/backup/dbtrandump2003_08_27_T23_32.bkp"
2&gt; go
</pre><p>
Note that we could not do this with pubs2 as it was not created with a separate log fragment.
</p><p>
Unless you keep dumping the transaction log, it will just keep growing until it fills up it's space and starts reporting error 1105. Users will be suspended and appear to be hanging while the situation remains unresolved. Dump the transaction log to file or tape, or simply truncate it if you don't use incremental backups.
</p><pre class="screen">
isql -Usa -PSecr3t -SSYBASE
1&gt; dump transaction pubs2 with truncate_only
2&gt; go

There are some other external utilities that are useful to know. The Java based applications need the JDBC driver installed, this is included with newer servers under the product name jConnect. There is a separate CD that comes with ASE 11.9.2.x and 12.5.0.x called "PC Client CD". This is a set of Windows-based tools for administration, pop the CD into your Windows box and the installer will start up so you can select components from the CD.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

What follows is a brief description of the architecture of ASE and how you can peek into this a bit closer.
In order to get an overview of what ASE is doing and how it is set up we'll use a combination of internal ASE commands and OS commands.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm510"></a>5.1. Processes</h3></div></div></div><p>
Each ASE server running on the machine will have at least one OS process, the <code class="filename">dataserver</code> binary, and may have many such running. A single server instance consists of at least one <code class="filename">dataserver</code> process. Under Sybase terminology, such <code class="filename">dataserver</code> processes that are cooperating and communicating with each other in shared memory are known as engines. For production use, one CPU on the server machine is often reserved as dedicated to host each Sybase engine. The engine may then be configured to hog this CPU, even when there is no active work it will idle loop polling for new incoming client connections to avoid context switches. Of course, this behaviour is entirely configurable and running one or more server instances on a single-CPU machine is not a problem - depending of course upon the load on these servers. As long as there is sufficient memory for each instance and they are started on different TCP ports, there is no problem having several instances on one machine - even of different versions.
</p><p>
A simple <span class="command"><strong>ps</strong></span> will show you the <code class="filename">dataserver</code> processes (by default you only have one), Sybase has provided a utility named <span class="command"><strong>showserver</strong></span> that will just show you the Sybase-related processes that are active. The <span class="command"><strong>sp_sysmon</strong></span> stored procedure will monitor ASE for a given time interval, then dump out several pages of global performance data. The Engine section shows how active the server really is, regardless of the CPU usage shown on OS level.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm521"></a>5.2. Physical Storage</h3></div></div></div><p>
The ASE server does I/O to the raw devices or files, these are represented internally as virtual devices. A database can reside on one or spread out on many of these virtual devices, and a virtual device can hold many databases if you want. You should locate the OS-level device files on fast disks and make sure they are not removed or messed with by other applications or sysadmins on a cleanup crusade. The path to the virtual devices are stored in the master..sysdevices table, you can list these with the <span class="command"><strong>sp_helpdevice</strong></span> stored procedure.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm525"></a>5.3. Network</h3></div></div></div><p>
The server listens for incoming connections on one or several TCP ports. You identify the server by the logical Sybase server name when you connect. This logical name is listed in the interfaces file, used by both ASE server and clients such as isql. When the ASE server is started, it finds it's name in the RUN_SERVER file, looks this up in the interfaces file, finds the master entry and starts a listener on the IP / port found there. When you start isql it also looks for the logical server name in the interfaces file, but looks for the query line instead. Normally this is the same IP and port, but it gives you the option of starting the server on several different IPs and ports and configure clients in different parts of the network to utilize different pathways to the server. JDBC does not use the interfaces file, but instead lets you use the IP and port as part of the URL.
</p><p>
You can observe the open port and established connections with <span class="command"><strong>netstat</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>lsof -i</strong></span>. It is also possible to trace the communication using <span class="command"><strong>tcpdump</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>Ethereal</strong></span>, these utilities have support for the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol used in Sybase client-server connections.
</p><p>
Once a client has connected it will be visible inside ASE as a task, an internal process. These are not seen as separate OS processes, but can be listed with the <span class="command"><strong>sp_who</strong></span> stored procedure.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm535"></a>5.4. Memory</h3></div></div></div><p>
You can configure how much memory you want ASE to use down to a certain needed minimum and up to whatever your OS and your ASE version combination will allow you. Except for doing careful analysis and clever design and SQL writing, using more of the available memory is what makes databases speed up without changing hardware. By default, most of the memory you allow allocated to ASE is used for caching data to avoid disk I/O as much as possible. Another area of memory is used to cache stored procedures in a compiled form, enabling these to be readily re-used without having to read from disk as frequently. Smaller parts are reserved for various administrative memory structures needed by the server for keeping track of each user connection, each database and so on.
</p><p>
On OS level you can see this normally contiguous memory chunk with <span class="command"><strong>ipcs -m</strong></span>.
Inside ASE you can use <span class="command"><strong>sp_configure</strong></span> to read and modify configuration parameters such as total memory. There are several ways of determining the efficiency of memory usage, this art is explained in the Performance and Tuning Guide.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm541"></a>5.5. Boot Process</h3></div></div></div><p>
You start the server using the startserver utility. This will call the RUN_* file that you specify on the command line. If you open this RUN_SERVER file in a text editor you will find it simply calls the <code class="filename">dataserver</code> executable with several parameters listed in the file. These are documented in the utility guide.
The server reads its configuration file (specified by one of the parameters) and allocates the amount of shared memory stated in that file (NOTE: this is configured in 2KB pages, not bytes), then does it's own internal distribution of this memory for various purposes. Once the memory is available, the process of initializing (you can think of it as "mounting") the virtual devices used to store databases is started. When these are verified available and OK, the databases have to go through recovery. This means reading the write-ahead transaction log and comparing any changes recorded there to the actual data stored. Transactions are redone and undone as needed to get the databases to a clean and correct state. Once the process is done the databases will be online. For the system databases the same process is applied, except for the scratchpad database tempdb which will be totally overwritten with the model template database and any remaining space zeroed out. Finally the TCP port is opened and the server is ready to accept incoming client connections.

Sybase provides client development libraries under the name of Open Client Developer's Kit which is included in their SDK. There is also an Embedded SQL/C precompiler which enables you to add SQL code to your C programs
</p><p>
If you prefer to use free / open source products, there is the FreeTDS project at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freetds.org/" target="_top">http://www.freetds.org/</a>. This is a re-implementation of Sybase's Tabular Data Stream (TDS), used for the client-server communication.
</p><p>
Note that Microsoft has modified their SQL Server TDS dialect from their Sybase legacy and you are no longer guaranteed that Microsoft SQL Server clients can communicate with a Sybase server or vice versa. MS SQL Server 6.5 came with a patch to enable Sybase TDS compatibility, later versions (7.0, 2000) do not support the Sybase communication protocol.

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Java / JDBC
</p><p>
Sybase ships the jConnect JDBC driver with ASE for Linux in ASE 12.5.0.x and up. There are both JDBC 1.0 and 2.0 implementations, labeled as jConnect 4.x and 5.x respectively. These are Type 4 JDBC drivers, which means they are 100% Java implementations of the TDS protocol.
</p><p>
The FreeTDS project mentioned above also ships a JDBC driver.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
ODBC
</p><p>For Windows clients, the ODBC drivers are shipped on the "PC Client CD". This used to be a ODBC layer on top of the Open Client runtime libaries, but are being modified to speak TDS directly instead.
</p><p>
There is also an ODBC driver available from FreeTDS. Unfortunately, it appears there is no unixODBC (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.unixodbc.org/" target="_top">http://www.unixodbc.org/</a>) driver available yet.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</p><p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</p><p>

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</p><p>

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</p><p>

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</p><p>

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</p><p>

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</p><p>

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm669"></a>1.1. 
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
</h3></div></div></div><p>

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p><p>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</p><p>

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</p><p>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</p><p>

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p><p>

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</p><p>

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
</p><p>

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</p><p>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p><p>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</p><p>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</p><p>

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</p><p>

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
</p><p>

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
</p><p>

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</p><p>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</p><p>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p><p>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p><p>

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</p><p>

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</p><p>

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

</p><p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</p><p>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p><p>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p><p>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</p><p>

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</p><p>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</p><p>

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</p><p>
    NO WARRANTY
</p><p>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p><p>

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p><p>
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm703"></a>1.2. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3></div></div></div><p>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</p><p>

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</em></span>
Copyright (C) <span class="emphasis"><em>yyyy name of author</em></span>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

</pre><p>

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</p><p>

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <span class="emphasis"><em>year name of author</em></span>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre><p>

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
</p><p>

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

</pre><p>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
