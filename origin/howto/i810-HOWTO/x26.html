tried getting XFree86 3.3.6 working with the i810 and failed, or perhaps those 
who have not even heard that X4.x supports the i810 and have been struggling 
vainly with their <TT

suppose the majority of people who find these instructions useful will have 
already loaded X4.x. You lot can skip this bit. Anyway, if you do need to

>2.2. Get and compile kernel 2.2.18 or 2.4.x (including mknod agpgart

></H2
><P
>You can get either kernel from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.com"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.kernel.com</A
>. Of 
course, read everything called README while you are at it. (In the README 
literature that comes with the 2.4.x kernel, there is an important note about 
where to unpack the source. Make sure you read it.) Put the kernel source file 
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/kernels</TT
>, and 
then run the following compile sequence, which I learned from a linuxnewbie 
article (to which you should refer if my directions are not clear enough for 
you, however it is specific to 2.2.x kernels). It can be found at the following address; <A
HREF="http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nfh/intel/compiling/kernel_update.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nfh/intel/compiling/kernel_update.html</A
>. 
Of course, the location of the still-packed kernel is not really relevant, it 
only matters that it is unpacked to an acceptable location. OK, now for the 
commands:</P
><P
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>tar -xzvf /usr/src/kernels/linux-2.4.x.tar.gz</KBD
></P

><P
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>bzcat /usr/src/kernels/linux-2.4.x.tar.bz2 | tar xv</KBD
></P
><P
>and watch the screen spew out pages of information about what's happening. 
When it is finished it will have created a new <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>linux</TT
> folder.</P
><P
>OK, so, change to the new directory:</P
><P
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"

><P
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"

></P
><P
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"

></P
><P
>There's also <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make xconfig</B
>, but you haven't got X running, 
or you wouldn't be reading this. So that won't work. And I'm embarrassed to 
mention it in such an imperfect fashion but there is also something like 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make oldconfig</B
> but I can't find any reference to it in my 
books. In any case I am not addressing it here, though I am sure the procedure 
for it is very similar to that which follows for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
menuconfig</B
>, should you be awkward and want to use it.</P
><P
>Now, I have gone through three text based kernel compiles (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
config</B
>) and know how long winded they are. I reommend <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
menuconfig</B
> instead, which requires only that ncurses be loaded (you 
don't need X) and you will be taken through the pretty face of kernel 
recompilation. I loaded ncurses during a custom install of Red Hat 6.1, but I 
forget exactly at which stage that option is available. Otherwise ncurses is, 
I'm sure, on your distro's CD in rpm format, so if issuing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
menuconfig</B
> just produces errors, install ncurses and try 
again.</P
><P
>The most relevant stages of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

our particular problem are:</P
><P

the above instruction has been followed), and</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>select the appropriate sub-option of "/dev/agpgart (AGP) support" (again not

section of the HOWTO after I have tested it. I recommend the static mode here 
because I ran this procedure on a test version of the 2.4.x kernel and it was 
suggested to me that loading statically was a safer and stabler way to go. Now 
that 2.4.x is officially out there, perhaps modules will be more sensible. 
I'll let you know how it goes. (Thanks to Heron Ordonez for this.))</P

You will probably see that <TT

a symbolic link to <TT

CLASS="FILENAME"

true for many distros, but not all. I think some store <TT

> in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>, 
while <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>System.map</TT
> resides in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
>. Whatever the case is, use your brain and 
apply these instructions accordingly. So, basically you need to remove the 
symbolic links like so:

>You don't need to use absolute pathnames if you are in <TT

and do use absolute pathnames, you just have longer names for your symbolic 
files. In fact the whole symbolic link thing here is only necessary if
you want to play it that way. Essentially, minimalistically, you can have 
one kernel called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vmlinuz</TT
> 
and name all the others by their version number (or just trash them!), and swap  
all the names around when you want to boot another kernel. Or give each kernel a unique 
name, and have one entry per kernel in <TT

have experienced this) the new kernel will not be available for booting. Which 
would be silly. So after all this take a deep breath and reboot, select your 
new kernel and with fingers crossed, watch. It should work. If it does, go and 
celebrate a little. But don't let it get to your head because you have yet to 
mknod the agpgart module, a simple yet essential procedure done thusly:

be nothing for you to choose, so choose that very nothing. You'll be entering

>As you can see I have only given X the option of "1024x768", and have a 
default colour depth of 24 bits, because I like it that way, and the i810 can 
easily cope with that resolution and depth on my 17" monitor. How that would 
work on a 21" I do not know. Experimentation will teach you.</P

than I can give here of the mysteries of the <TT

the man page (see above). This is really important if you want to have a 
chance of solving any problems that are bound to come up now and again, that 
have not been covered here.</P

>This is a kind of a p.s. to this section but may be helpful. I had a wee 
problem when going through the XF86Config part of this HOWTO during a test 
run. It stemmed from having read but not fully understood some blurb about the 
i810 and X4.x not working at all resolutions with a buffer extension (or 
something like that). Anyway, I made no notes about this and cannot therefore 
remember exactly what I read. Because I remember this vaguely I can only say 
the following with certainty; you need the following stanza at the beginning 
of your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> file:
