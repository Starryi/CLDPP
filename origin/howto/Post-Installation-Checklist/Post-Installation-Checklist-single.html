>     You have just completed installing your own Linux system. You
     have just made an upgrade to your existing Linux system. You are
     happy with the first few checkouts and usage experience.  You
     want to make sure you will enjoy this system in spite of any
     damage which may occur later because of any unexpected "faux
     pas".
   </P
><P
>     It is a good idea to keep a snapshot of the new system, so that
     you can be assured that in the event of any misfortune with your
     Linux installation, you can always recover without any permanent
     damage. This checklist will help you with precautionary steps
     you must take, as soon as you complete installation of Linux. It
     is a sequel to the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Pre-Installation-Checklist/"
TARGET="_top"
>GNU/Linux 
     pre-installation checklist</A
>, and a companion to the official
     <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Installation HOWTO</A
>.
     This checklist also contains a <A

     automate the process of making a snapshot of your system.

     installation along with all files and directories. This is not
     always possible, necessary, or advisable. The next best thing
     would be to take a backup of the most essential information and
     files. The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>shivalik</B

     you. The script creates a directory called
     <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

     information (and files) there. To be absolutely prepared for any
     eventuality, you must copy the entire
