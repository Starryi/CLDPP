Because Emacspeak is actually integrated into the Emacs environment (instead of just running "on top" of an environment like most screen readers), Emacspeak provides much more context-specific information than its commercial screen reader counterparts.  In this sense, Emacspeak is not a "screen reader," but rather a subsystem of Emacs that produces speech output.</p><p>Although Emacspeak only works inside Emacs, there are a large number of both built-in and add-on applications for Emacs that do everything from keeping track of your appointments to playing CDs to coding HTML.  In addition, Emacs has a special command shell mode that can be used to run any command-line application. </p><p>This HOWTO focuses on installing Emacspeak on your Linux system. It does not discuss how to actually use Emacs or
Emacspeak - for information on usage, refer to the Emacspeak User's Guide, available at 
 <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/guides.html#espk" target="_top">http://www.tldp.org/guides.html#espk</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="documentation-conventions"></a>3. Documentation Conventions</h2></div></div></div><p>As per the LDP Author Guide, this HOWTO uses the following documentation conventions:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>File Names:</td><td><code class="filename">file.extension</code></td></tr><tr><td>Commands to be typed:</td><td><span class="command"><strong>command</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td>Command prompt:</td><td><code class="prompt">&gt;</code> (unless otherwise specified)</td></tr></table></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="requirements"></a>4. Requirements</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a number of things you must have before you install Emacspeak, including Linux, a Linux-compatible sound card, Emacs, and a hardware or software speech synthesizer. You should read this section carefully before installing Emacspeak, because Emacspeak will not function correctly if any of the requirements are missing.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="linux-distros"></a>4.1. Linux Distributions</h3></div></div></div><p>This HOWTO assumes that you have already installed Linux on your system.  If not, you may wish to refer to the "Linux Information Sheet" by Michael K. Johnson a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html" target="_top">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html</a>. It provides an introduction to Linux, discusses some hardware requirements, and also has a section on how to obtain Linux.</p><p>There are a number of different Linux distributions (distros) that you can choose from. All of the distros are based upon the same basic Linux code, or kernel, but each distro has a different installation process, features, and support options. Martin Wheeler's "Distributions HOWTO," at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Distributions-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Distributions-HOWTO/index.html</a>, discusses the pros and cons of a number of Linux distros. You can also find information about each distribution on their respective web sites. Those distros known to support Emacspeak are listed below with their URLs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Debian Linux - <a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org" target="_top">http://www.debian.org</a></p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Mandrake Linux - <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/" target="_top">http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/</a></p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Red Hat Linux - <a class="ulink" href="http://www.redhat.com" target="_top">http://www.redhat.com</a></p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Slackware Linux - <a class="ulink" href="http://www.slackware.com" target="_top">http://www.slackware.com</a></p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>SuSE Linux - <a class="ulink" href="http://www.suse.com" target="_top">http://www.suse.com</a></p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>TurboLinux - <a class="ulink" href="http://www.turbolinux.com" target="_top">http://www.turbolinux.com</a></p></li></ul></div><p>All of the distributions listed above can be downloaded free of charge from their respective web sites. However, the downloads are quite large, so you'll need a fast Internet connection. You will also need access to a CD burner, to burn your own CDs from the images you download. Depending on the distribution, you may also have to download and make a boot floppy. Once you have burned the CDs and created the boot floppy, you can install Linux.  Alternatively, you can purchase the disks at your local computer store for between $30 and $80 US. Both of these options are discussed at length in the Linux Installation HOWTO at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/overview.html" target="_top">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/overview.html</a>, so you may want to refer there before making a decision as to which route to take.</p><p>Most methods of installation require sighted assistance. However, if you prefer to install Linux yourself, there are two options.  The first is to install Linux from a DOS machine running JAWS. This option requires two machines, a null modem cable, JAWS for DOS, and a hardware speech synthesizer. More information on this option can be found in, <a class="link" href="#appendixa" title="8. Appendix A: Installing Linux from a DOS machine">Appendix A</a>.  The second option is installing one of the distributions that includes a Speakup kernel patch.  This option requires a Speakup-enabled distro and a hardware synthesizer. Speakup is a screen reader that is patched into the kernel, so it starts talking at boot and will speak during the entire installation. Currently, Speakup is supported on Debian, Red Hat 7.1, and Slackware. The Speakup option also requires you to download the CD images and make your own CDs. Refer to the Speakup home page at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux-speakup.org" target="_top">http://www.linux-speakup.org</a> for instructions for this option.</p><p>For assistance with installing Linux, Eric Raymond's Linux Installation HOWTO, at  
 <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO" target="_top">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO</a>, is highly recommended reading. In the HOWTO, Eric discusses hardware requirements, choosing a distro, and installing your distro of choice. If Eric's HOWTO does not provide enough installation-specific information, you can refer to the documentation specific to your distribution, available at the URLs given in the distro list. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="emacs"></a>4.2. Emacs</h3></div></div></div><p>Because Emacspeak is an Emacs subsystem, you must have Emacs installed for Emacspeak to work.  Most distributions include Emacs by default, so it should be installed on your system when you install Linux. </p><p>If you do not have Emacs on your system or you want to check on the latest version of Emacs, refer to the Emacs homepage at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</a>. If you install Emacs on your own or choose to upgrade, be sure to install all of Emacs, including both the X and non-X versions (even if you do not plan to use X). Some Emacs applications depend on packages included in the X version, even if you use those applications in the non-X version of Emacs.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Emacs and how to use it, an excellent place to start is the Emacs Beginner's HOWTO, by Jeremy D. Zawondy.  It's available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html" target="_top">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html</a>. There is also an online manual available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs/index.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs/index.html</a>. Alternatively, you can try the built-in Emacs tutorial.

Because each Linux distribution comes with different applications, you may find that your distro does not quite have everything that Emacspeak needs to run properly.  Therefore, before you install anything else, it is important to make sure you have all the necessary applications, as listed below.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>Tk, Tcl,</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>Tclx</strong></span>: Check to make sure you have these applications.

 <a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lesstif" target="_top">http://sourceforge.net/projects/lesstif</a>. Currently, the latest release of Lesstif is version 0.93.14; however, Marty Moore recommends using the 0.92.32 version.

To produce speech output, you need two things: something to parse the information on the screen (Emacspeak), and something to produce the sounds you hear as output (a speech synthesizer). Emacspeak can use either a hardware or software synthesizer to produce sound output.  Software synthesizers have the benefit of being either free or very inexpensive. Hardware synthesizers can run from $150 to $1600 or more, but they are typically easier to install than software synthesizers.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="hardware-synths"></a>4.4.1. Hardware synthesizers</h4></div></div></div><p>Emacspeak supports the following hardware synthesizers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> Accent</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> Apollo</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> Braille Lite</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> Braille n' Speak</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> DECtalk Express (the original Emacspeak synthesizer) or MultiVoice</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> DoubleTalk PC and AT </p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> Internal DECtalk PC and DECtalk PC2</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> LiteTalk</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p> Type n' Speak</p></li></ul></div><p>Support for the DECtalk Express and MultiVoice synthesizers is built into Emacspeak.  If you have a synthesizer other than a DECtalk Express, you may require additional drivers or "speech servers" to get Emacspeak to work with your synthesizer.</p><p>The Internal DECtalk PC and DECtalk PC2 require a kernel driver available from <a class="ulink" href="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.95.tgz" target="_top">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.95.tgz</a>.

In addition, if you want to perform any tasks that require a multi-channel sound card, such as playing auditory cues when you open or close an Emacs buffer, you must make sure that your sound card is multi-channel capable.</p><p>There is a complete list of Linux-compatible sound cards available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.alsa-project.org" target="_top">http://www.alsa-project.org</a>.  In addition, you can usually find information on your distribution's web site about which sound cards are supported with each distro.</p><p>Once you have ensured that your sound card is Linux compatible, you can install a software synthesizer.  Currently the only one that works with Emacspeak is IBM's ViaVoice Text-to-Speech (TTS), formerly called ViaVoice Outloud. Many Emacspeak users use this software synthesizer, because it is free of charge. Instructions for installing ViaVoice can be found in, <a class="link" href="#appendixb" title="9. Appendix B: Installing ViaVoice TTS">Appendix B</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installing-emacspeak"></a>5. Installing Emacspeak</h2></div></div></div><p>Assuming that you have all the items listed in, <a class="link" href="#requirements" title="4. Requirements">Requirements</a>, you are ready to install Emacspeak.

If you select the binary file, <code class="filename">emacspeak.tar.gz</code>, you will need to configure and make Emacspeak. If you have some experience with Linux, or if you're using a distribution that does not support RPMs, you should download this option. If your distro supports RPMs, you can download the ready-to-install version of Emacspeak (<code class="filename">emacspeak-14.0-1.noarch.rpm</code>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Download the file and place it in your home directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type <span class="command"><strong>su root</strong></span> and provide the root password if you are not already logged onto your machine as root.

If you downloaded the binary version, unzip and untar the file, then follow the installation directions in the README file in the resulting <code class="filename">emacspeak-14.0</code> directory.</p><p>Once you have installed the rpm, you'll see a message saying that Emacspeak installed successfully, as well as some additional instructions. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you are using Emacspeak v.14 or earlier and also using ViaVoice TTS as your synthesizer, change directories to the <code class="filename">/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/linux-outloud</code> directory and type the command <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>. This command compiles the ViaVoice TTS server. If you are not using ViaVoice, or if you have Emacspeak v.15 or later, you do not need to complete this step. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Using the <span class="command"><strong>cd</strong></span> command, change directories to the <code class="filename">/etc</code> directory and open your <code class="filename">profile</code> file with your favorite text editor (you must be root to edit the <code class="filename">profile</code>).

This section steps though finding and correcting this problem. </p><p>The first step is to make sure that you have tcl correctly installed, as explained in the following instructions.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>First, make sure you are in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers</code> directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the command prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>tcl <em class="replaceable"><code>name of speech server</code></em></strong></span>. The most common speech servers are <span class="command"><strong>dtk-exp</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>outloud</strong></span>.
</p></li></ol></div><p>If you get an error such as <span class="command"><strong>bash: tcl:: command not found</strong></span>, it means that tcl/tclx is not correctly installed on your system. You must get the latest version of either tcl or tclx and install it before Emacspeak will work.</p><p>If everything is installed correctly, you should hear a voice saying "IBM ViaVoice. This is Emacspeak" or something similar. A <span class="command"><strong>%</strong></span> command prompt should also appear. At the prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>q "this is a test."</strong></span> Then press <span class="command"><strong>Return</strong></span> and type <span class="command"><strong>d</strong></span>. This command runs the speech, so you should hear "this is a test" spoken. If you hear this, the server script is running properly. You can type <span class="command"><strong>exit</strong></span> to quit tcl.</p><p>You may also get an error like <span class="command"><strong>stdiosynth executable not found</strong></span> when you type <span class="command"><strong>tcl<em class="replaceable"><code>name of speech server</code></em></strong></span>, and then get a command prompt. Testing has shown that this error can appear even when <span class="application">stdiosynth</span> is correctly installed and Emacspeak is working. Even if you get this error message, you should still get the <span class="command"><strong>%</strong></span> command prompt, so you should be able to test the script.</p><p>If the script test was unsuccessful, (if tcl was found and you got a <code class="prompt">%</code> prompt but you did not hear any speech), the next step is to make sure that you have the correct lines in your <code class="filename">profile</code> file to let Emacspeak know where to find the speech server. To check this, follow these steps: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Go to your <code class="filename">/etc</code> directory, then use you favorite text editor to open the file named<code class="filename">profile</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure the following lines are in the file: </p><pre class="programlisting"> export DTK_PROGRAM DTK_PROGRAM=<em class="replaceable"><code>name of speech server</code></em></pre><p>The most common speech servers, are <span class="command"><strong>outloud</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>dtk-exp</strong></span>. </p></li></ol></div><p>If these lines are not in your <code class="filename">profile</code> file, add them and then re-test tcl. If you are using ViaVoice TTS as your synthesizer, Emacspeak should work correctly at this point. If you are using a hardware synthesizer and you still do not get any sound, check to make sure that the environment variable <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> is set correctly in your <code class="filename">/etc/profile</code> file.</p><p>The variable <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> specifies which port your hardware synthesizer is plugged into on
your computer. Under Linux, if your synthesizer is plugged into com1, you must set <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> to<code class="filename">/dev/ttyS0</code>, and if it is in com2, then <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> should be set to <code class="filename">/dev/ttyS1</code>. To set this variable, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open your <code class="filename">profile</code> file located in the <code class="filename">/etc</code> directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Look for the variable <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code>.  If this variable does not exist, scroll to the bottom of the <code class="filename">profile</code> and add the following line: </p><pre class="programlisting">export DTK_PORT=/dev/ttySX</pre><p>In this line, the "X" should be replaced by the correct port number, as described above. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When you are finished, save and close the <code class="filename">profile</code> file. </p></li></ol></div><p>Finally, retest tcl, and if it works, restart Emacspeak. Emacspeak should work correctly. </p><p>If you have a hardware synthesizer and are still not getting any speech, you probably do not have the necessary permissions to use the serial port for your synthesizer. There are a number of solutions to this problem, and the best solution  depends on your operating environment. For example, if you are in a multi-user environment, controlling the access permissions to the serial device may be a concern. The options are as follows: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Change the ownership of the serail device to the user running Emacspeak.

As with the other instructions in this HOWTO, I tried, unfortunately without success, to duplicate this procedure. However, I have provided the information gathered during testing in the following section.  If you successfully install Linux from a Windows&#8482; or DOS&#8482; machine over a null-modem cable, please let me know the procedure you followed and I'll include it here. </p><p> Please note that the original instructions for installing Linux over a null modem cable were written for a DOS machine.  I first attempted to reproduce these instructions with my Windows 2000 machine (from the DOS prompt) and Red Hat 7.1.  Although I successfully downloaded and installed JAWS for DOS (available from Freedom Scientific at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/morejaws.asp" target="_top">http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/morejaws.asp</a>), I was unable to get a DOS VT100 terminal emulator installed. I tried using TELIX, which was popular several years ago, but when I tried to install TELIX version 3.51, I got a runtime error. Since I was unable to find any other DOS terminal emulators, I decided to try using a Windows screenreader and terminal emulator instead. This section documents the procedure I tried with the Windows machine.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="appendix-a-requirements"></a>8.1. Requirments</h3></div></div></div><p>For this process, you will need a machine with a working speech synthesizer and a terminal emulator program. For my test, I used a Windows 2000 machine and tried both Narrarator (which comes with Windows 2000) and JAWS for Windows v.3.5. For the terminal emulator, I used tried both Hyperterminal (which comes with Windows) and CRT (which can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt" target="_top">http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt</a>). You will also need a second machine (on which to install Linux), a null modem cable, and a copy of your preferred Linux distribution on either floppy disk or CD-ROM. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup"></a>8.2. Connecting the computers</h3></div></div></div><p>To connect the two computers, you need a "null modem" cable.  A "null modem" cable is a serial cable that connects ground to ground and transmits on each end to receive on the other.  The cable that comes with the DOS application<span class="application">LapLink</span> will work fine.  The <span class="application">LapLink</span> cable is particularly handy because it has both a 9 pin and a 25 pin connector on each end.  Alternatively, you may be able to find a null modem cable at your local computer store, or you can have one made. If you choose to have one made, here are the required connections:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>For two 9 pin connectors, connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin 3, pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 2, and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 5.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For two 25 pin connectors, connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin 3, pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 2, and pin 7 (signal ground) to pin 7.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For a 9 pin connector (first) to a 25 pin connector (second), connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin 2 (transmit data), pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 3 (receive data), and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 7 (signal ground). </p></li></ul></div><p>Once you have your null modem cable, you'll need to connect the two machines while both of them are off. It's
easiest to use COM1 on both machines. Once you've got them connected, you're ready to start them up, as discussed in the next section</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="installing"></a>8.3. Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>Once your machines are connected via the null modem cable, boot the DOS/Windows machine, then start the terminal emulation program.  For my test, I tried both Hyperterminal (which comes with Windows 2000) and CRT (which can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt" target="_top">http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt</a>. For some reason, the arrow keys did not work in HyperTerminal, making navigation within the HyperTerminal window impossible. However, the arrow keys (as well as Tab and Return) do work in CRT, so I recommend using CRT as your terminal emulator.</p><p>Set the terminal emulator for 9600 baud, no parity, eight data bits, 1 stop bit. If "Flow control" is an option, select Hardware.  Also be sure to set your terminal emulation mode to VT100. Start the terminal emulator connection (you won't get any data at this point, as your Linux machine should still be off).</p><p> Once you've set up the terminal emulator on your DOS/Windows machine, insert the "boot" floppy or CD into your Linux machine and boot the machine. With Red Hat, at the <code class="prompt">boot:</code> prompt, I typed in the command <span class="command"><strong>linux text console=ttyS0</strong></span>.  Note that the "s" in "ttyS0" is capitalized, and that's a "zero" at the end of the string, not a capital letter "o." Other distributions may require other strings, so if you know the syntax required for distros other than Red Hat, please let me know and I will include that information here. </p><p> Once you've typed in this string at the <code class="prompt">boot:</code> prompt and hit <span class="command"><strong>Return</strong></span>, you should get output in your terminal emulator program on your DOS/Windows machine.  Unfortunately, at this point I discovered that neither JAWS for Windows nor Narrarator produces speech output in either the HyperTerminal or CRT terminal windows. This ultimately stymied my attempts to install Linux over a null modem cable. </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="appendixb"></a>9. Appendix B: Installing ViaVoice TTS</h2></div></div></div><p>This section steps through the installation of ViaVoice TTS, which can be used as a software synthesizer with Emacspeak.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="downloading-viavoice"></a>9.1. Downloading ViaVoice</h3></div></div></div><p>First, you must download the ViaVoice Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Run Time Kit (RTK), as described in the following steps.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Go to IBM's ViaVoice TTS website a
