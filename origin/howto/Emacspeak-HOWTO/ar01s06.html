If there is a topic that is not covered here, you should review the Emacspeak mailing list archives at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~priestdo/emacspeak/" target="_top">http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~priestdo/emacspeak/</a>. You can find the answers to many additional questions there.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>The volume on my system is very low - how can I increase it?</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>The easiest way to turn up system volume is with a set of speakers. However, sometimes speakers aren't feasible (for example, with a laptop), or even with speakers, the volume is still not loud enough. In this case, you can use the application <span class="application">aumix</span> to increase your system's volume. </p><p><span class="application">Aumix</span> comes with many distributions of Linux, but if your distro doesn't have <span class="application">aumix</span>, you can download it from <a class="ulink" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aumix/aumix-2.7.tar.gz" target="_top">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aumix/aumix-2.7.tar.gz</a>. The latest version is 2.7.</p><p>To use <span class="application">aumix</span> to increase your system's volume, type the command <span class="command"><strong>aumix -v +100</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>aumix -w +100</strong></span>.  The numerical value is the percentage volume, so in this case 100 means 100%.  You may want to try different settings to find the most comfortable one for you. </p><p>For more information on using <span class="application">aumix</span>, type <span class="command"><strong>aumix -h</strong></span> at the command prompt.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>sndconfig doesn't recognize my soundcard.  What should I do?</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>If sndconfig doesn't recognize your soundcard, you should see if you can download a driver for your card.  The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) Web site, located at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.alsa-project.org" target="_top">http://www.alsa-project.org</a>, lists many sound cards, along with their drivers (if available).  Another alternative is the Open Sound System (OSS) for Linux. OSS is a commercial implementation of the Linux kernel drivers, and a list of supported cards can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.4front-tech.com/osshw.html" target="_top">http://www.4front-tech.com/osshw.html</a>. There used to be a free version, but apparently it is
no longer available (if anyone knows differently, please let me know).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Some users have reported compatibility problems with ViaVoice and ALSA drivers. I have been unable to determine
the exact problem or solution from various mailing archives, so if anyone can provide more information on this issue, please let me know. </p></div></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>When I try to install the ViaVoice RTK rpm file, I get the error "libXm.so.1 is missing."  What's wrong?</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>The file <code class="filename">libXm.so.1</code> is part of the <code class="filename">lesstif</code> distribution, and it is also a shared library. This error message indicates that either <code class="filename">lesstif</code> is not installed, or that the
system is unable to locate the file. Often shared libraries are referenced by a symbolic link to the real shared library file, which may be named something like <code class="filename">libXm.so.1.0.17</code>. When the name of the symbolic link to the shared library and the name of the real shared library file differ, the system may not be able to find the shared library, even
if it exists. If another program depends on a shared library that cannot be found, an error message like the one above results. In the case of <code class="filename">libXm.so.1</code>, lesstif is only needed for graphical demonstration programs.  Thus, if you do not plan to use the graphical mode, it is safe to install the ViaVoice RTK rpm using the option
<span class="command"><strong>--nodeps</strong></span>, which tells ViaVoice to ignore any missing dependencies. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Note that this is only a workaround, not a "fix," and that it only works for  ViaVoice Text-to-speech (TTS).

in the <code class="filename">/usr/include</code> directory, then change directories to <code class="filename">/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/linux-outloud</code>, and type <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> at the command prompt. The ViaVoice TTS should now make successfully.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>When I start Emacspeak, I keep getting the error "process speaker not running." What's wrong?</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>If you are getting this error message, there are several possible causes. This section steps though finding and correcting this problem. </p><p>The first step is to make sure that you have tcl correctly installed, as explained in the following instructions.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>First, make sure you are in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers</code> directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the command prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>tcl <em class="replaceable"><code>name of speech server</code></em></strong></span>. The most common speech servers are <span class="command"><strong>dtk-exp</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>outloud</strong></span>.
</p></li></ol></div><p>If you get an error such as <span class="command"><strong>bash: tcl:: command not found</strong></span>, it means that tcl/tclx is not correctly installed on your system. You must get the latest version of either tcl or tclx and install it before Emacspeak will work.</p><p>If everything is installed correctly, you should hear a voice saying "IBM ViaVoice. This is Emacspeak" or something similar. A <span class="command"><strong>%</strong></span> command prompt should also appear. At the prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>q "this is a test."</strong></span> Then press <span class="command"><strong>Return</strong></span> and type <span class="command"><strong>d</strong></span>. This command runs the speech, so you should hear "this is a test" spoken. If you hear this, the server script is running properly. You can type <span class="command"><strong>exit</strong></span> to quit tcl.</p><p>You may also get an error like <span class="command"><strong>stdiosynth executable not found</strong></span> when you type <span class="command"><strong>tcl<em class="replaceable"><code>name of speech server</code></em></strong></span>, and then get a command prompt. Testing has shown that this error can appear even when <span class="application">stdiosynth</span> is correctly installed and Emacspeak is working. Even if you get this error message, you should still get the <span class="command"><strong>%</strong></span> command prompt, so you should be able to test the script.</p><p>If the script test was unsuccessful, (if tcl was found and you got a <code class="prompt">%</code> prompt but you did not hear any speech), the next step is to make sure that you have the correct lines in your <code class="filename">profile</code> file to let Emacspeak know where to find the speech server. To check this, follow these steps: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Go to your <code class="filename">/etc</code> directory, then use you favorite text editor to open the file named<code class="filename">profile</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure the following lines are in the file: </p><pre class="programlisting"> export DTK_PROGRAM DTK_PROGRAM=<em class="replaceable"><code>name of speech server</code></em></pre><p>The most common speech servers, are <span class="command"><strong>outloud</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>dtk-exp</strong></span>. </p></li></ol></div><p>If these lines are not in your <code class="filename">profile</code> file, add them and then re-test tcl. If you are using ViaVoice TTS as your synthesizer, Emacspeak should work correctly at this point. If you are using a hardware synthesizer and you still do not get any sound, check to make sure that the environment variable <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> is set correctly in your <code class="filename">/etc/profile</code> file.</p><p>The variable <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> specifies which port your hardware synthesizer is plugged into on
your computer. Under Linux, if your synthesizer is plugged into com1, you must set <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> to<code class="filename">/dev/ttyS0</code>, and if it is in com2, then <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code> should be set to <code class="filename">/dev/ttyS1</code>. To set this variable, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open your <code class="filename">profile</code> file located in the <code class="filename">/etc</code> directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Look for the variable <code class="varname">DTK_PORT</code>.  If this variable does not exist, scroll to the bottom of the <code class="filename">profile</code> and add the following line: </p><pre class="programlisting">export DTK_PORT=/dev/ttySX</pre><p>In this line, the "X" should be replaced by the correct port number, as described above. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When you are finished, save and close the <code class="filename">profile</code> file. </p></li></ol></div><p>Finally, retest tcl, and if it works, restart Emacspeak. Emacspeak should work correctly. </p><p>If you have a hardware synthesizer and are still not getting any speech, you probably do not have the necessary permissions to use the serial port for your synthesizer. There are a number of solutions to this problem, and the best solution  depends on your operating environment. For example, if you are in a multi-user environment, controlling the access permissions to the serial device may be a concern. The options are as follows: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Change the ownership of the serail device to the user running Emacspeak. To do this, type <span class="command"><strong>chown <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> /dev/ttyS0</strong></span> at the command prompt then type <span class="command"><strong>chmode u+rw dev/ttyS0</strong></span>. </p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Add the user to the group associated with the serial device. On Red Hat systems this is usually the group<span class="command"><strong>tty</strong></span>. To do this edit the <code class="filename">/etc/group</code> file and find the line starting with <span class="command"><strong>tty:</strong></span>. At the end of that line, add ",<em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em>" where username is your username.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Give read/write access to the serial device for all users. This is the least secure solution, but if you are the  only user on the system, it will not matter. To give read/write access, make sure you are the root user and at the command prompt type <span class="command"><strong>chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS0</strong></span>.</p></li></ul></div></dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5. Installing Emacspeak </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7. Additional resources</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
