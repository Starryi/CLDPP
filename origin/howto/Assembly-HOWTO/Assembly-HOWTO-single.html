This document aims answering questions of those who program or want to program
32-bit x86 assembly using <span class="emphasis"><em>free software</em></span>, particularly
under the Linux operating system. At many places Universal Resource Locators
(<acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>) are given for some software or documentation
repository. This document also points to other documents about non-free,
non-x86, or non-32-bit assemblers, although this is not its primary goal. Also
note that there are FAQs and docs about programming on your favorite platform
(whatever it is), which you should consult for platform-specific issues, not
related directly to assembly programming.
</p><p>
Because the main interest of assembly programming is to build the guts of
operating systems, interpreters, compilers, and games, where C compiler fails
to provide the needed expressiveness (performance is more and more seldom as
issue), we are focusing on development of such kind of software.
</p><p>
If you don't know what <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/" target="_top">
<span class="emphasis"><em>free software</em></span></a> is, please do read
<span class="emphasis"><em>carefully</em></span> the GNU

General Public License</a> (<acronym class="acronym">GPL</acronym> or

the model for most of their licenses. It generally comes in a file named
<code class="filename">COPYING</code> (or <code class="filename">COPYING.LIB</code>). Literature
from the <a class="link" href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_top">Free Software Foundation</a>
(<acronym class="acronym">FSF</acronym>) might help you too. Particularly, the interesting
feature of free software is that it comes with source code which you can
consult and correct, or sometimes even borrow from. Read your particular
license carefully and do comply to it.

Well, I wouldn't want to interfere with what you're doing, but here is some
advice from the hard-earned experience.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm130"></a>Pros and Cons</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm132"></a>The advantages of Assembly</h3></div></div></div><p>
Assembly can express very low-level things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
you can access machine-dependent registers and I/O
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can control the exact code behavior in critical sections that might
otherwise involve deadlock between multiple software threads or hardware
devices
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can break the conventions of your usual compiler, which might allow some
optimizations (like temporarily breaking rules about memory allocation,
threading, calling conventions, etc)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can build interfaces between code fragments using incompatible conventions
(e.g. produced by different compilers, or separated by a low-level interface)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can get access to unusual programming modes of your processor (e.g. 16 bit
mode to interface startup, firmware, or legacy code on Intel PCs)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can produce reasonably fast code for tight loops to cope with a bad
non-optimizing compiler (but then, there are free optimizing compilers
available!)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can produce hand-optimized code perfectly tuned for your particular
hardware setup, though not to someone else's
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you can write some code for your new language's optimizing compiler (that is
something what very few ones will ever do, and even they not often)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
i.e. you can be in complete control of your code
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm154"></a>The disadvantages of Assembly</h3></div></div></div><p>
Assembly is a very low-level language (the lowest above hand-coding the binary
instruction patterns). This means
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
it is long and tedious to write initially
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
it is quite bug-prone
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
your bugs can be very difficult to chase
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
your code can be fairly difficult to understand and modify, i.e. to maintain
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
the result is non-portable to other architectures, existing or upcoming
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
your code will be optimized only for a certain implementation of a same
architecture: for instance, among Intel-compatible platforms each CPU design
and its variations (relative latency, through-output, and capacity, of
processing units, caches, RAM, bus, disks, presence of FPU, MMX, 3DNOW, SIMD
extensions, etc) implies potentially completely different optimization
techniques. CPU designs already include: Intel 386, 486, Pentium, PPro, PII,
PIII, PIV; Cyrix 5x86, 6x86, M2; AMD K5, K6 (K6-2, K6-III), K7 (Athlon, Duron).
New designs keep popping up, so don't expect either this listing and your code
to be up-to-date.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
you spend more time on a few details and can't focus on small and large
algorithmic design, that are known to bring the largest part of the speed up
(e.g. you might spend some time building very fast list/array manipulation
primitives in assembly; only a hash table would have sped up your program much
more; or, in another context, a binary tree; or some high-level structure
distributed over a cluster of CPUs)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
a small change in algorithmic design might completely invalidate all your
existing assembly code. So that either you're ready (and able) to rewrite it
all, or you're tied to a particular algorithmic design
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
On code that ain't too far from what's in standard benchmarks, commercial
optimizing compilers outperform hand-coded assembly (well, that's less true on
the x86 architecture than on RISC architectures, and perhaps less true for
widely available/free compilers; anyway, for typical C code, GCC is fairly
good);
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
And in any case, as moderator John Levine says on
<a class="link" href="news:comp.compilers" target="_top">comp.compilers</a>,
</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
"compilers make it a lot easier to use complex data structures,<br>
and compilers don't get bored halfway through<br>
and generate reliably pretty good code."<br>
</p></div><p>
They will also <span class="emphasis"><em>correctly</em></span> propagate code transformations
throughout the whole (huge) program when optimizing code between procedures
and module boundaries.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm182"></a>Assessment</h3></div></div></div><p>
All in all, you might find that though using assembly is sometimes needed, and
might even be useful in a few cases where it is not, you'll want to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
minimize use of assembly code
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
encapsulate this code in well-defined interfaces
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
have your assembly code automatically generated from patterns expressed in a
higher-level language than assembly (e.g. GCC inline assembly macros)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
have automatic tools translate these programs into assembly code
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
have this code be optimized if possible
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
All of the above, i.e. write (an extension to) an optimizing compiler back-end.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Even when assembly is needed (e.g. OS development), you'll find that not so
much of it is required, and that the above principles retain.
</p><p>
See the Linux kernel sources concerning this: as little assembly as needed,
resulting in a fast, reliable, portable, maintainable OS. Even a successful
game like DOOM was almost massively written in C, with a tiny part only being
written in assembly for speed up.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm200"></a>How to NOT use Assembly</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm202"></a>General procedure to achieve efficient code</h3></div></div></div><p>
As Charles Fiterman says on <a class="link" href="news:comp.compilers" target="_top">comp.compilers</a>
about human vs computer-generated assembly code:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
The human should always win and here is why.<br>
<br>
First the human writes the whole thing in a high level language.<br>
Second he profiles it to find the hot spots where it spends its time.<br>
Third he has the compiler produce assembly for those small sections of code.<br>
Fourth he hand tunes them looking for tiny improvements over the machine<br>
generated code.<br>
<br>
The human wins because he can use the machine.<br>
</p></div></blockquote></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm208"></a>Languages with optimizing compilers</h3></div></div></div><p>
Languages like ObjectiveCAML, SML, CommonLISP, Scheme, ADA, Pascal, C, C++,
among others, all have free optimizing compilers that will optimize the bulk
of your programs, and often do better than hand-coded assembly even for tight
loops, while allowing you to focus on higher-level details, and without
forbidding you to grab a few percent of extra performance in the
above-mentioned way, once you've reached a stable design. Of course, there are
also commercial optimizing compilers for most of these languages, too!
</p><p>
Some languages have compilers that produce C code, which can be further
optimized by a C compiler: LISP, Scheme, Perl, and many other. Speed is fairly
good.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm212"></a>General procedure to speed your code up</h3></div></div></div><p>
As for speeding code up, you should do it only for parts of a program that a
profiling tool has consistently identified as being a performance bottleneck.
</p><p>
Hence, if you identify some code portion as being too slow, you should
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
first try to use a better algorithm;
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
then try to compile it rather than interpret it;
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
then try to enable and tweak optimization from your compiler;
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
then give the compiler hints about how to optimize (typing information in LISP;
register usage with GCC; lots of options in most compilers, etc).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
then possibly fallback to assembly programming
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Finally, before you end up writing assembly, you should inspect generated code,
to check that the problem really is with bad code generation, as this might
really not be the case: compiler-generated code might be better than what you'd
have written, particularly on modern multi-pipelined architectures! Slow parts
of a program might be intrinsically so. The biggest problems on modern
architectures with fast processors are due to delays from memory access,
cache-misses, TLB-misses, and page-faults; register optimization becomes
useless, and you'll more profitably re-think data structures and threading
to achieve better locality in memory access. Perhaps a completely different
approach to the problem might help, then.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm228"></a>Inspecting compiler-generated code</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are many reasons to inspect compiler-generated assembly code. Here is
what you'll do with such code:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
check whether generated code can be obviously enhanced with hand-coded assembly
(or by tweaking compiler switches)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
when that's the case, start from generated code and modify it instead of
starting from scratch
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
more generally, use generated code as stubs to modify, which at least gets
right the way your assembly routines interface to the external world
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
track down bugs in your compiler (hopefully the rarer)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
The standard way to have assembly code be generated is to invoke your compiler
with the <code class="option">-S</code> flag. This works with most Unix compilers,
including the GNU C Compiler (GCC), but YMMV. As for GCC, it will produce more
understandable assembly code with the <code class="option">-fverbose-asm</code> command-line
option. Of course, if you want to get good assembly code, don't forget your usual
optimization options and hints!
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm243"></a>Linux and assembly</h2></div></div></div><p>
As you probably noticed, in general case you don't need to use assembly
language in Linux programming. Unlike DOS, you do not have to write Linux
drivers in assembly (well, actually you can do it if you really want). And
with modern optimizing compilers, if you care of speed optimization for
different CPU's, it's much simpler to write in C. However, if you're reading
this, you might have some reason to use assembly instead of C/C++.
</p><p>
You may <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to use assembly, or you may
<span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to use assembly. In short, main practical
(<span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span>) reasons of diving into the assembly realm are
<span class="emphasis"><em>small code</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="application">libc</span>
independence</em></span>. Impractical (<span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span>), and the most
often reason is being just an old crazy hacker, who has twenty years old habit
of doing everything in assembly language.
</p><p>
However, if you're porting Linux to some embedded hardware you can be quite
short at the size of whole system: you need to fit kernel,
<span class="application">libc</span> and all that stuff of
<span class="application">(file|find|text|sh|etc.) utils</span> into several hundreds
of kilobytes, and every kilobyte costs much. So, one of the possible ways is to
rewrite some (or all) parts of system in assembly, and this will really save
you a lot of space. For instance, a simple <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> written in
assembly can take less than 600 bytes; you can fit a server consisting of
kernel, httpd and ftpd in 400 KB or less... Think about it.

The well-known GNU C/C++ Compiler (GCC), an optimizing 32-bit compiler at the
heart of the GNU project, supports the x86 architecture quite well, and
includes the ability to insert assembly code in C programs, in such a way that
register allocation can be either specified or left to GCC. GCC works on most
available platforms, notably Linux, *BSD, VSTa, OS/2, *DOS, Win*, etc.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm263"></a>Where to find GCC</h3></div></div></div><p>
GCC home page is <a class="link" href="http://gcc.gnu.org" target="_top">http://gcc.gnu.org</a>.

<a name="p-djgpp"></a>
DOS port of GCC is called
<a class="link" href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/" target="_top">DJGPP</a>.
</p><p>

<a class="link" href="http://www.mingw.org" target="_top">mingw</a> 
</p><p>
There is also an OS/2 port of GCC called EMX;
it works under DOS too,
and includes lots of unix-emulation library routines.
Look around the following site:

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm275"></a>Where to find docs for GCC Inline Asm</h3></div></div></div><p>
The documentation of GCC includes documentation files in TeXinfo format.
You can compile them with TeX and print then result,
or convert them to <code class="filename">.info</code>, and browse them with emacs,
or convert them to <code class="filename">.html</code>, or nearly whatever you like;
convert (with the right tools) to whatever you like,
or just read as is. The <code class="filename">.info</code> files
are generally found on any good installation for GCC.
</p><p>
The right section to look for is <code class="literal">C Extensions::Extended Asm::</code>
</p><p>
Section	<code class="literal">Invoking GCC::Submodel Options::i386 Options::</code> might
help too. Particularly, it gives the i386 specific constraint names for
registers: 
<code class="literal">abcdSDB</code> correspond to
<code class="literal">%eax</code>,
<code class="literal">%ebx</code>,
<code class="literal">%ecx</code>,
<code class="literal">%edx</code>,
<code class="literal">%esi</code>,
<code class="literal">%edi</code>
and
<code class="literal">%ebp</code>
respectively (no letter for <code class="literal">%esp</code>).

GCC depends on GAS for assembling and follows its syntax (see below);
do mind that inline asm needs percent characters to be quoted,
they will be passed to GAS.
See the section about GAS below.
</p><p>
Find <span class="emphasis"><em>lots</em></span> of useful examples in the
<code class="filename">linux/include/asm-i386/</code>
subdirectory of the sources for the Linux kernel.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm301"></a>Invoking GCC to build proper inline assembly code</h3></div></div></div><p>
Because assembly routines from the kernel headers (and most likely your own
headers, if you try making your assembly programming as clean as it is in the
linux kernel) are embedded in <code class="function">extern inline</code> functions,
GCC must be invoked with the <code class="option">-O</code> flag (or <code class="option">-O2</code>,
<code class="option">-O3</code>, etc), for these routines to be available. If not, your
code may compile, but not link properly, since it will be looking for
non-inlined <code class="function">extern</code> functions in the libraries against
which your program is being linked! Another way is to link against libraries
that include fallback versions of the routines.
</p><p>
Inline assembly can be disabled with <code class="option">-fno-asm</code>, which will have
the compiler die when using extended inline asm syntax, or else generate calls
to an external function named <code class="function">asm()</code> that the linker can't
resolve. To counter such flag, <code class="option">-fasm</code> restores treatment of the
<code class="literal">asm</code> keyword.
</p><p>
More generally, good compile flags for GCC on the x86 platform are
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>gcc -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -W -Wall</strong></span>
</p><p>
<code class="option">-O2</code> is the good optimization level in most cases. Optimizing
besides it takes more time, and yields code that is much larger, but only a bit
faster; such over-optimization might be useful for tight loops only (if any),
which you may be doing in assembly anyway. In cases when you need really strong
compiler optimization for a few files, do consider using up to
<code class="option">-O6</code>.
</p><p>
<code class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</code> allows generated code to skip the stupid
frame pointer maintenance, which makes code smaller and faster, and frees a
register for further optimizations. It precludes the easy use of debugging tools
(<span class="command"><strong>gdb</strong></span>), but when you use these, you just don't care about size
and speed anymore anyway.
</p><p>
<code class="option">-W -Wall</code> enables all useful warnings and helps you to catch
obvious stupid errors.
</p><p>
You can add some CPU-specific <code class="option">-m486</code> or such flag so that GCC
will produce code that is more adapted to your precise CPU. Note that modern
GCC has <code class="option">-mpentium</code> and such flags (and
<a class="link" href="http://goof.com/pcg/" target="_top">PGCC</a> has even more), whereas
GCC 2.7.x and older versions do not. A good choice of CPU-specific flags should
be in the Linux kernel. Check the TeXinfo documentation of your current GCC
installation for more.
</p><p>
<code class="option">-m386</code> will help optimize for size, hence also for speed on
computers whose memory is tight and/or loaded, since big programs cause swap,
which more than counters any "optimization" intended by the larger code. In
such settings, it might be useful to stop using C, and use instead a language
that favors code factorization, such as a functional language and/or FORTH,
and use a bytecode- or wordcode- based implementation.
</p><p>
Note that you can vary code generation flags from file to file, so
performance-critical files will use maximum optimization, whereas other files
will be optimized for size.
</p><p>
To optimize even more, option <code class="option">-mregparm=2</code> and/or corresponding
function attribute might help, but might pose lots of problems when linking to
foreign code, <span class="emphasis"><em>including <span class="application">libc</span></em></span>.
There are ways to correctly declare foreign functions so the right call
sequences be generated, or you might want to recompile the foreign libraries
to use the same register-based calling convention...
</p><p>
Note that you can add make these flags the default by editing file
<code class="filename">/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2.3/specs</code> or wherever that
is on your system (better not add <code class="option">-W -Wall</code> there, though). The
exact location of the GCC specs files on system can be found by
<span class="command"><strong>gcc -v</strong></span>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm340"></a>Macro support</h3></div></div></div><p>
GCC allows (and requires) you to specify register constraints in your inline
assembly code, so the optimizer always know about it; thus, inline assembly
code is really made of patterns, not forcibly exact code.
</p><p>
Thus, you can put your assembly into CPP macros, and inline C functions, so
anyone can use it in as any C function/macro. Inline functions resemble macros
very much, but are sometimes cleaner to use. Beware that in all those cases,
code will be duplicated, so only local labels (of <code class="literal">1:</code> style)
should be defined in that asm code. However, a macro would allow the name for
a non local defined label to be passed as a parameter (or else, you should use
additional meta-programming methods). Also, note that propagating inline asm
code will spread potential bugs in them; so watch out doubly for register
constraints in such inline asm code.
</p><p>
Lastly, the C language itself may be considered as a good abstraction to
assembly programming, which relieves you from most of the trouble of assembling.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="p-gas"></a>GAS</h2></div></div></div><p>
GAS is the GNU Assembler, that GCC relies upon.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm349"></a>Where to find it</h3></div></div></div><p>
Find it at the same place where you've found GCC, in the binutils package.
The latest version of binutils is available from
<a class="link" href="http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/" target="_top">
http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm353"></a>What is this AT&amp;T syntax</h3></div></div></div><p>
Because GAS was invented to support a 32-bit unix compiler, it uses standard
AT&amp;T syntax, which resembles a lot the syntax for standard m68k assemblers,
and is standard in the UNIX world. This syntax is neither worse, nor better
than the Intel syntax. It's just different. When you get used to it, you find
it much more regular than the Intel syntax, though a bit boring.
</p><p>
Here are the major caveats about GAS syntax:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Register names are prefixed with <code class="literal">%</code>, so that registers are
<code class="literal">%eax</code>, <code class="literal">%dl</code> and so on, instead of just
<code class="literal">eax</code>, <code class="literal">dl</code>, etc. This makes it possible to
include external C symbols directly in assembly source, without any risk of
confusion, or any need for ugly underscore prefixes.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The order of operands is source(s) first, and destination last, as opposed to the
Intel convention of destination first and sources last. Hence, what in Intel
syntax is <code class="function">mov eax,edx</code> (move contents of register
<code class="literal">edx</code> into register <code class="literal">eax</code>) will be in GAS
syntax <code class="function">mov %edx,%eax</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The operand size is specified as a suffix to the instruction name. The suffix
is <code class="literal">b</code> for (8-bit) byte, <code class="literal">w</code> for (16-bit)
word, and <code class="literal">l</code> for (32-bit) long. For instance, the correct
syntax for the above instruction would have been
<code class="function">movl %edx,%eax</code>. However, gas does not require strict
AT&amp;T syntax, so the suffix is optional when size can be guessed from
register operands, and else defaults to 32-bit (with a warning).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Immediate operands are marked with a <code class="literal">$</code> prefix, as in
<code class="function">addl $5,%eax</code> (add immediate long value 5 to register
<code class="literal">%eax</code>).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Missing operand prefix indicates that it is memory-contents; hence
<code class="function">movl $foo,%eax</code> puts the <span class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span> of
variable <code class="literal">foo</code> into register <code class="literal">%eax</code>, but
<code class="function">movl foo,%eax</code> puts the <span class="emphasis"><em>contents</em></span> of
variable <code class="literal">foo</code> into register <code class="literal">%eax</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Indexing or indirection is done by enclosing the index register or indirection
memory cell address in parentheses, as in
<code class="function">testb $0x80,17(%ebp)</code> (test the high bit of the byte value
at offset 17 from the cell pointed to by <code class="literal">%ebp</code>).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
<a name="p-convert"></a>
Note: There are <a class="link" href="#s-res" title="Chapter 7. Resources">few programs</a> which may help you to
convert source code between AT&amp;T and Intel assembler syntaxes; some of the
are capable of performing conversion in both directions.
</p><p>
GAS has comprehensive documentation in TeXinfo format, which comes at least
with the source distribution. Browse extracted <code class="filename">.info</code>
pages with Emacs or whatever. There used to be a file named gas.doc or as.doc
around the GAS source package, but it was merged into the TeXinfo docs. Of
course, in case of doubt, the ultimate documentation is the sources themselves!
A section that will particularly interest you is 
<code class="literal">Machine Dependencies::i386-Dependent::</code>
</p><p>
Again, the sources for Linux (the OS kernel) come in as excellent examples;
see under <code class="filename">linux/arch/i386/</code> the following files:
<code class="filename">kernel/*.S</code>, <code class="filename">boot/compressed/*.S</code>,
<code class="filename">math-emu/*.S</code>.
</p><p>
If you are writing kind of a language, a thread package, etc., you might as
well see how other languages (<a class="link" href="http://para.inria.fr/" target="_top">
OCaml</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.jwdt.com/~paysan/gforth.html" target="_top">
Gforth</a>, etc.), or thread packages (QuickThreads, MIT pthreads,
LinuxThreads, etc), or whatever else do it.
</p><p>
Finally, just compiling a C program to assembly might show you the syntax for
the kind of instructions you want. See section <a class="xref" href="#s-doyou" title="Chapter 2. Do you need assembly?">Do you need assembly?</a> above.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm412"></a>Intel syntax</h3></div></div></div><p>
Good news are that starting from binutils 2.10 release, GAS supports Intel
syntax too. It can be triggered with <code class="literal">.intel_syntax</code>
directive. Unfortunately this mode is not documented (yet?) in the official
binutils manual, so if you want to use it, try to examine
<a class="link" href="http://www.lxhp.in-berlin.de/lhpas86.html" target="_top">
http://www.lxhp.in-berlin.de/lhpas86.html</a>, which is an extract from AMD
64bit port of binutils 2.11.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm417"></a>16-bit mode</h3></div></div></div><p>
Binutils (2.9.1.0.25+) now fully support 16-bit mode
(registers <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> addressing) on i386 PCs. Use
<code class="literal">.code16</code> and <code class="literal">.code32</code> to switch
between assembly modes.
</p><p>
Also, a neat trick used by several people (including the oskit authors) is to
force GCC to produce code for 16-bit real mode, using an inline assembly
statement <code class="literal">asm(".code16\n")</code>. GCC will still emit only 32-bit
addressing modes, but GAS will insert proper 32-bit prefixes for them.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm425"></a>Macro support</h3></div></div></div><p>
GAS has some macro capability included, as detailed in the texinfo docs.
Moreover, while GCC recognizes <code class="filename">.s</code> files as raw assembly
to send to GAS, it also recognizes <code class="filename">.S</code> files as files
to pipe through CPP before feeding them to GAS. Again and again, see Linux
sources for examples.
</p><p>
GAS also has GASP (GAS Preprocessor), which adds all the usual macroassembly
tricks to GAS. GASP comes together with GAS in the GNU binutils archive. It
works as a filter, like <a class="xref" href="#p-cpp" title="CPP">CPP</a> and <a class="xref" href="#p-m4" title="M4">M4</a>. I
have no idea on details, but it comes with its own texinfo documentation,
which you would like to browse (<span class="command"><strong>info gasp</strong></span>), print, grok.
GAS with GASP looks like a regular macro-assembler to me.

</p><p>
NASM can be used as a backend for the free LCC compiler (support files
included).
</p><p>
Unless you're using BCC as a 16-bit compiler (which is out of scope of this
32-bit HOWTO), you should definitely use NASM instead of say AS86 or MASM,
because it runs on all platforms.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
NASM comes with a disassembler, NDISASM.
</p></div><p>
Its hand-written parser makes it much faster than GAS, though of course, it
doesn't support three bazillion different architectures. If you like
Intel-style syntax, as opposed to GAS syntax, then it should be the assembler
of choice...

AS86 is a 80x86 assembler (16-bit and 32-bit) with integrated macro support.
It has mostly Intel-syntax, though it differs slightly as for addressing modes.
Some time ago it was used in a several projects, including the Linux kernel,
but eventually most of those projects have moved to GAS or NASM. AFAIK, only
ELKS continues to use it.
</p><p>
AS86 can be found at
<a class="link" href="http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/" target="_top">
http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/</a>, in the bin86 package with linker (ld86),
or as separate archive. Documentation is available as the man page and as.doc
from the source package. When in doubt, the source code itself is often a good
doc: though it is not very well commented, the programming style is
straightforward. AS86 is part of a number of BSD and Linux distributions.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
AS86 is primarily a 16 bit assembler.
</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Using AS86 with BCC</h3><p>

YASM is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the "new" BSD License.
It is designed from the ground up to allow for multiple syntaxes to be
supported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object
formats including COFF, Win32 and Mach-O. Another primary module of the overall
design is an optimizer module.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm492"></a>FASM</h3></div></div></div><p>
FASM (flat assembler) is a fast, efficient 80x86 assembler that runs in
'flat real mode'. Unlike many other 80x86 assemblers, FASM only requires the
source code to include the information it really needs. It is written in itself
and is very small and fast. It runs on DOS/Windows/Linux and can produce flat
binary, DOS EXE, Win32 PE, COFF and Linux ELF output. See
<a class="link" href="http://flatassembler.net" target="_top">http://flatassembler.net</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm496"></a>OSIMPA (SHASM)</h3></div></div></div><p>
osimpa is an assembler for Intel 80386 processors and subsequent, written
entirely in the GNU Bash command interpreter shell. The predecessor of osimpa
was shasm. osimpa is much cleaned up, can create useful Linux ELF executables,
and has various HLL-like extensions and programmer convenience commands.
</p><p>
It is (of course) slower than other assemblers. It has its own syntax (and uses
its own names for x86 opcodes) Fairly good documentation is included. Check it

Aasm is an advanced assembler designed to support several target architectures.
It has been designed to be easily extended and, should be considered as a good
alternative to monolithic assembler development for each new target CPUs
and binary file formats.
</p><p>
Aasm should make assembly programming easier for developer, by providing
a set of advanced features including symbol scopes, an expressions engine,
big integer support, macro capability, numerous and accurate warning messages.
Its dynamic modular architecture enables Aasm to extend its set of features
with plug-ins by taking advantages of dynamic libraries.
</p><p>
The input module supports Intel syntax (like nasm, tasm, masm, etc.).
The x86 assembler module supports all opcodes up to P6 including MMX, SSE
and 3DNow! extensions. F-CPU and SPARC assembler modules are under development.
Several output modules are available for ELF, COFF, IntelHex, and raw binary
formats.

HLA</a> is a <span class="emphasis"><em>H</em></span>igh <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span>evel
<span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>ssembly language. It uses a high level language like

high level language style control structures (if, while, repeat..until, etc.)
that help you write much more readable code.
</p><p>
HLA is free and comes with source, Linux and Win32 versions available. On Win32
you need MASM and a 32-bit version of MS-link on Win32, on Linux you need GAS,
because HLA produces specified assembler code and uses that assembler for final
assembling and linking.

type safety of TAL programs. Moreover, the typing constructs are expressive
enough to encode most source language programming features including records

abstract data types, subtyping, and modules. Just as importantly, TAL is
flexible enough to admit many low-level compiler optimizations. Consequently,
TAL is an ideal target platform for type-directed compilers that want to
produce verifiably safe code for use in secure mobile code applications or
extensible operating system kernels.

Assembly programming is a bore, but for critical parts of programs.
</p><p>
You should use the appropriate tool for the right task, so don't choose
assembly when it does not fit; C, OCaml, perl, Scheme, might be a better
choice  in the most cases.
</p><p>
However, there are cases when these tools do not give fine enough control on
the machine, and assembly is useful or needed. In these cases you'll
appreciate a system of macroprocessing and metaprogramming that allows
recurring patterns to be factored each into one indefinitely reusable
definition, which allows safer programming, automatic propagation of pattern
modification, etc. Plain assembler often is not enough, even when one is doing
only small routines to link with C.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm573"></a>External filters</h2></div></div></div><p>
Whatever is the macro support from your assembler, or whatever language you
use (even C!), if the language is not expressive enough to you, you can have
files passed through an external filter with a Makefile rule like that:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
%.s:    %.S other_dependencies
        $(FILTER) $(FILTER_OPTIONS) &lt; $&lt; &gt; $@
</pre><p>
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="p-cpp"></a>CPP</h3></div></div></div><p>
CPP is truly not very expressive, but it's enough for easy things, it's
standard, and called transparently by GCC.
</p><p>
As an example of its limitations, you can't declare objects so that destructors
are automatically called at the end of the declaring block; you don't have
diversions or scoping, etc.
</p><p>
CPP comes with any C compiler. However, considering how mediocre it is, stay
away from it if by chance you can make it without C.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="p-m4"></a>M4</h3></div></div></div><p>
M4 gives you the full power of macroprocessing, with a Turing equivalent
language, recursion, regular expressions, etc. You can do with it everything
that CPP cannot.
</p><p>
See
<a class="link" href="ftp://ftp.forth.org/pub/Forth/Compilers/native/unix/this4th.tar.gz" target="_top">
macro4th (this4th)</a> as an example of advanced macroprogramming using m4.
</p><p>
However, its disfunctional quoting and unquoting semantics force you to use
explicit continuation-passing tail-recursive macro style if you want to do
<span class="emphasis"><em>advanced</em></span> macro programming (which is remindful of TeX
-- BTW, has anyone tried to use TeX as a macroprocessor for anything else than
typesetting ?). This is NOT worse than CPP that does not allow quoting and
recursion anyway.
</p><p>
The right version of M4 to get is <code class="literal">GNU m4</code> which has the most
features and the least bugs or limitations of all. m4 is designed to be slow
for anything but the simplest uses, which might still be ok for most assembly
programming (you are not writing million-lines assembly programs, are you?).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm592"></a>Macroprocessing with your own filter</h3></div></div></div><p>
You can write your own simple macro-expansion filter with the usual tools:
perl, awk, sed, etc. It can be made rather quickly, and you control everything.
But, of course, power in macroprocessing implies "the hard way".
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm595"></a>Metaprogramming</h2></div></div></div><p>
Instead of using an external filter that expands macros, one way to do things
is to write programs that write part or all of other programs.
</p><p>
For instance, you could use a program outputting source code

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
to generate sine/cosine/whatever lookup tables,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
to extract a source-form representation of a binary file,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
to compile your bitmaps into fast display routines,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
to extract documentation, initialization/finalization code,
description tables, as well as normal code from the same source files,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
to have customized assembly code, generated from a perl/shell/scheme script
that does arbitrary processing,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
to propagate data defined at one point only into several cross-referencing
tables and code chunks.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
etc.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Think about it!
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm615"></a>Backends from compilers</h3></div></div></div><p>
Compilers like GCC, SML/NJ, Objective CAML, MIT-Scheme, CMUCL, etc,
do have their own generic assembler backend,
which you might choose to use,
if you intend to generate code semi-automatically
from the according languages,
or from a language you hack:
rather than write great assembly code,
you may instead modify a compiler so that it dumps great assembly code!

</p><p>
The assembler manipulates abstract syntax trees, so it could equally serve as
the basis for a assembly syntax translator, a disassembler, a common
 assembler/compiler back-end, etc. Also, the full power of a real language,
 Scheme, make it unchallenged as for macroprocessing/metaprogramming.

This is the preferred way if you are developing mixed C-asm project. Check GCC
docs and examples from Linux kernel <code class="filename">.S</code> files that go through
<span class="application">gas</span> (not those that go through
<span class="application">as86</span>).
</p><p>
32-bit arguments are pushed down stack in reverse syntactic order (hence
accessed/popped in the right order), above the 32-bit near return address.
<code class="literal">%ebp</code>, <code class="literal">%esi</code>, <code class="literal">%edi</code>,
<code class="literal">%ebx</code> are callee-saved, other registers are caller-saved;
<code class="literal">%eax</code> is to hold the result, or <code class="literal">%edx:%eax</code>
for 64-bit results.
</p><p>
FP stack: I'm not sure, but I think result is in <code class="literal">st(0)</code>,
whole stack caller-saved.
</p><p>
Note that GCC has options to modify the calling conventions by reserving
registers, having arguments in registers, not assuming the FPU, etc. Check the
i386 <code class="filename">.info</code> pages.
</p><p>
Beware that you must then declare the <code class="literal">cdecl</code> or
<code class="literal">regparm(0)</code> attribute for a function that will follow
standard GCC calling conventions. See
<code class="literal">C Extensions::Extended Asm::</code> section from the GCC info
pages. See also how Linux defines its <code class="literal">asmlinkage</code> macro.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm653"></a>ELF vs a.out problems</h3></div></div></div><p>
Some C compilers prepend an underscore before every symbol, while others do
not.
</p><p>
Particularly, Linux a.out GCC does such prepending, while Linux ELF GCC does
not.
</p><p>
If you need to cope with both behaviors at once, see how existing packages do.
For instance, get an old Linux source tree, the Elk, qthreads, or OCaml.
</p><p>
You can also override the implicit C-&gt;asm renaming by inserting statements like

</p><pre class="programlisting">
	void foo asm("bar") (void);
</pre><p>

to be sure that the C function <code class="function">foo()</code>
will be called really <code class="function">bar</code> in assembly.
</p><p>
Note that the <span class="command"><strong>objcopy</strong></span> utility from the binutils package
should allow you to transform your a.out objects into ELF objects,
and perhaps the contrary too, in some cases.
More generally, it will do lots of file format conversions.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm664"></a>Direct Linux syscalls</h3></div></div></div><p>
Often you will be told that using <span class="application">C library</span>
(<acronym class="acronym">libc</acronym>) is the only way, and direct system calls are bad.
This is true. To some extent. In general, you must know that
<span class="application">libc</span> is not sacred, and in <span class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span>
cases it only does some checks, then calls kernel, and then sets errno. You can
easily do this in your program as well (if you need to), and your program will
be dozen times smaller, and this will result in improved performance as well,
just because you're not using shared libraries (static binaries are faster).
Using or not using <span class="application">libc</span> in assembly programming is
more a question of taste/belief than something practical. Remember, Linux is
aiming to be POSIX compliant, so does <span class="application">libc</span>.
This means that syntax of almost all <span class="application">libc</span> "system
calls" exactly matches syntax of real kernel system calls (and vice versa).
Besides, <span class="application">GNU libc</span>(<span class="application">glibc</span>)
becomes slower and slower from version to version, and eats more and more
memory; and so, cases of using direct system calls become quite usual.
However, the main drawback of throwing <span class="application">libc</span> away
is that you will possibly need to implement several
<span class="application">libc</span> specific functions (that are not just syscall
wrappers) on your own (<code class="function">printf()</code> and Co.), and you are
ready for that, aren't you? :-)
</p><p>
Here is summary of direct system calls pros and cons.
</p><p>
Pros:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
the smallest possible size; squeezing the last byte out of the system
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
the highest possible speed; squeezing cycles out of your favorite benchmark
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
full control: you can adapt your program/library to your specific language or
memory requirements or whatever
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
no pollution by libc cruft
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
no pollution by C calling conventions (if you're developing your own language
or environment)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
static binaries make you independent from libc upgrades or crashes, or from
dangling <code class="literal">#!</code> path to an interpreter (and are faster)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
just for the fun out of it (don't you get a kick out of assembly programming?)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Cons:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
If any other program on your computer uses the libc, then duplicating the libc
code will actually wastes memory, not saves it.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Services redundantly implemented in many static binaries are a waste of memory.
But you can make your libc replacement a shared library.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Size is much better saved by having some kind of bytecode, wordcode, or
structure interpreter than by writing everything in assembly. (the interpreter
itself could be written either in C or assembly.) The best way to keep multiple
binaries small is to not have multiple binaries, but instead to have an
interpreter process files with <code class="literal">#!</code> prefix. This is how OCaml
works when used in wordcode mode (as opposed to optimized native code mode),
and it is compatible with using the libc. This is also how Tom Christiansen's
Perl PowerTools reimplementation of unix utilities works. Finally, one last way
to keep things small, that doesn't depend on an external file with a hardcoded
path, be it library or interpreter, is to have only one binary, and have
multiply-named hard or soft links to it: the same binary will provide everything
you need in an optimal space, with no redundancy of subroutines or useless
binary headers; it will dispatch its specific behavior according to its
<em class="parameter"><code>argv[0]</code></em>; in case it isn't called with a recognized name,
it might default to a shell, and be possibly thus also usable as an interpreter!
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
You cannot benefit from the many functionalities that libc provides besides mere
linux syscalls: that is, functionality described in section 3 of the manual
pages, as opposed to section 2, such as malloc, threads, locale, password,
high-level network management, etc.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Therefore, you might have to reimplement large parts of libc, from
<code class="function">printf()</code> to <code class="function">malloc()</code> and
<code class="function">gethostbyname</code>. It's redundant with the libc effort, and
can be <span class="emphasis"><em>quite</em></span> boring sometimes. Note that some people have
already reimplemented "light" replacements for parts of the libc - - check
them out! (Redhat's minilibc, Rick Hohensee's

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Static libraries prevent you to benefit from libc upgrades as well as from libc
add-ons such as the <span class="application">zlibc</span> package, that does
on-the-fly transparent decompression of gzip-compressed files.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The few instructions added by the libc can be a
<span class="emphasis"><em>ridiculously</em></span> small speed overhead as compared to the cost
of a system call. If speed is a concern, your main problem is in your usage of
system calls, not in their wrapper's implementation.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Using the standard assembly API for system calls is much slower than using the
libc API when running in micro-kernel versions of Linux such as L4Linux, that
have their own faster calling convention, and pay high convention-translation
overhead when using the standard one (L4Linux comes with libc recompiled with
their syscall API; of course, you could recompile your code with their API,
too).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
See previous discussion for general speed optimization issue.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If syscalls are too slow to you, you might want to hack the kernel sources
(in C) instead of staying in userland.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
If you've pondered the above pros and cons, and still want to use direct
syscalls, then here is some advice.
</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
You can easily define your system calling functions in a portable way in C
(as opposed to unportable using assembly), by including
<code class="filename">asm/unistd.h</code>, and using provided macros.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Since you're trying to replace it, go get the sources for the libc, and
grok them. (And if you think you can do better, then send feedback to the
authors!)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
As an example of pure assembly code that does everything you want, examine
<a class="xref" href="#s-res" title="Chapter 7. Resources">Linux assembly resources</a>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Basically, you issue an <code class="function">int 0x80</code>, with the
<code class="literal">__NR_</code>syscallname number (from <code class="filename">asm/unistd.h</code>)
in <code class="literal">eax</code>, and parameters (up to <a class="link" href="#six-arg">six</a>)
in <code class="literal">ebx</code>, <code class="literal">ecx</code>, <code class="literal">edx</code>,
<code class="literal">esi</code>, <code class="literal">edi</code>, <a class="link" href="#six-arg">
<code class="literal">ebp</code></a> respectively.
</p><p>
Result is returned in <code class="literal">eax</code>, with a negative result being an
error, whose opposite is what libc would put into <code class="literal">errno</code>.
The user-stack is not touched, so you needn't have a valid one when doing a
syscall.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
<a name="six-arg"></a>
Passing sixth parameter in <code class="literal">ebp</code> appeared in Linux 2.4,
previous Linux versions understand only 5 parameters in registers.
</p></div><p>
<a class="link" href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lki/" target="_top">Linux Kernel Internals</a>,
and especially <a class="link" href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lki/lki-2.html#ss2.11" target="_top">
How System Calls Are Implemented on i386 Architecture?</a> chapter will give
you more robust overview.
</p><p>
As for the invocation arguments passed to a process upon startup, the general
principle is that the stack originally contains the number of arguments
<em class="parameter"><code>argc</code></em>, then the list of pointers that constitute
<em class="parameter"><code>*argv</code></em>, then a null-terminated sequence of
null-terminated <code class="literal">variable=value</code> strings for the
<em class="parameter"><code>environ</code></em>ment. For more details, do examine
<a class="xref" href="#s-res" title="Chapter 7. Resources">Linux assembly resources</a>, read the sources of C startup code from your libc
(<code class="filename">crt0.S</code> or <code class="filename">crt1.S</code>), or those from
the Linux kernel (<code class="filename">exec.c</code> and
<code class="filename">binfmt_*.c</code> in <code class="filename">linux/fs/</code>).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm775"></a>Hardware I/O under Linux</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you want to perform direct port I/O under Linux, either it's something very
simple that does not need OS arbitration, and you should see the
<code class="literal">IO-Port-Programming</code> mini-HOWTO; or it needs a kernel device
driver, and you should try to learn more about kernel hacking, device driver
development, kernel modules, etc, for which there are other excellent HOWTOs
and documents from the LDP.
</p><p>
Particularly, if what you want is Graphics programming, then do join one of the
<a class="link" href="http://www.ggi-project.org/" target="_top">GGI</a> or
<a class="link" href="http://www.XFree86.org/" target="_top">XFree86</a> projects.
</p><p>
Some people have even done better, writing small and robust XFree86 drivers in
an interpreted domain-specific language, GAL, and achieving the efficiency of
hand C-written drivers through partial evaluation (drivers not only not in asm,
but not even in C!). The problem is that the partial evaluator they used to
achieve efficiency is not free software. Any taker for a replacement?
</p><p>
Anyway, in all these cases, you'll be better when using GCC inline assembly
with the macros from <code class="filename">linux/asm/*.h</code> than writing full
assembly source files.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm785"></a>Accessing 16-bit drivers from Linux/i386</h3></div></div></div><p>
Such thing is theoretically possible (proof: see how
<a class="link" href="http://www.dosemu.org" target="_top">DOSEMU</a> can selectively grant
hardware port access to programs), and I've heard rumors that someone somewhere
did actually do it (in the PCI driver? Some VESA access stuff? ISA PnP? dunno).
If you have some more precise information on that, you'll be most welcome.
Anyway, good places to look for more information are the Linux kernel sources,
DOSEMU sources, and sources for various low-level programs under Linux.
(perhaps GGI if it supports VESA).
</p><p>
Basically, you must either use 16-bit protected mode or vm86 mode.
</p><p>
The first is simpler to setup, but only works with well-behaved code that won't
do any kind of segment arithmetics or absolute segment addressing (particularly
addressing segment 0), unless by chance it happens that all segments used can
be setup in advance in the LDT.
</p><p>
The later allows for more "compatibility" with vanilla 16-bit environments, but
requires more complicated handling.
</p><p>
In both cases, before you can jump to 16-bit code, you must

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
mmap any absolute address used in the 16-bit code (such as ROM, video buffers,
DMA targets, and memory-mapped I/O) from <code class="filename">/dev/mem</code> to your
process' address space,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
setup the LDT and/or vm86 mode monitor.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
grab proper I/O permissions from the kernel (see the above section)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Again, carefully read the source for the stuff contributed to the DOSEMU
project, particularly these mini-emulators for running ELKS and/or simple
<code class="filename">.COM</code> programs under Linux/i386.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm803"></a>DOS and Windows</h2></div></div></div><p>
Most DOS extenders come with some interface to DOS services. Read their docs
about that, but often, they just simulate <code class="function">int 0x21</code> and
such, so you do "as if" you are in real mode (I doubt they have more than stubs
and extend things to work with 32-bit operands; they most likely will just
reflect the interrupt into the real-mode or vm86 handler).
</p><p>
Docs about DPMI (and much more) can be found on
<a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Protected_Mode_Interface" target="_top">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Protected_Mode_Interface</a>).
</p><p>
DJGPP comes with its own (limited) <span class="application">glibc</span>
derivative/subset/replacement, too.
</p><p>
It is possible to cross-compile from Linux to DOS, see the
<code class="filename">devel/msdos/</code> directory of your local FTP mirror for
metalab.unc.edu; Also see the MOSS DOS-extender from the
<a class="link" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/" target="_top">Flux project</a>
from the university of Utah.
</p><p>
Other documents and FAQs are more DOS-centered; we do not recommend DOS
development.
</p><p><b>Windows and Co. </b>
This document is not about Windows programming, you can find lots of documents
about it everywhere... The thing you should know is that there is the
<a class="link" href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_top">cygwin32.dll library</a>,
for GNU programs to run on Win32 platform; thus, you can use GCC, GAS,
all the GNU tools, and many other Unix applications.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm819"></a>Your own OS</h2></div></div></div><p>
Control is what attracts many OS developers to assembly, often is what leads to
or stems from assembly hacking. Note that any system that allows
self-development could be qualified an "OS", though it can run "on the top" of
an underlying system (much like Linux over Mach or OpenGenera over Unix).
</p><p>
Hence, for easier debugging purpose, you might like to develop your "OS" first
as a process running on top of Linux (despite the slowness), then use the
<a class="link" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/oskit/" target="_top">Flux OS kit</a>
(which grants use of Linux and BSD drivers in your own OS) to make it
stand-alone. When your OS is stable, it is time to write your own hardware
drivers if you really love that.
</p><p>
This HOWTO will not cover topics such as bootloader code, getting into 32-bit
mode, handling Interrupts, the basics about Intel protected mode or V86/R86
braindeadness, defining your object format and calling conventions.
</p><p>
The main place where to find reliable information about that all, is source
code of existing OSes and bootloaders. Lots of pointers are on the following

Finally, if you still want to try this crazy idea and write something in
assembly (if you've reached this section -- you're real assembly fan),
here's what you need to start.
</p><p>
As you've read before, you can write for Linux in different ways; I'll show
how to use <span class="emphasis"><em>direct</em></span> kernel calls, since this is the fastest
way to call kernel service; our code is not linked to any library, does not
use ELF interpreter, it communicates with kernel directly.
</p><p>
I will show the same sample program in two assemblers, <span class="command"><strong>nasm</strong></span>
and <span class="command"><strong>gas</strong></span>, thus showing Intel and AT&amp;T syntax.
</p><p>
You may also want to read
<a class="link" href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/intro.html" target="_top">
Introduction to UNIX assembly programming</a> tutorial, it contains sample
code for other UNIX-like OSes.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm839"></a>Tools you need</h3></div></div></div><p>
First of all you need assembler (compiler) -- <span class="command"><strong>nasm</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>gas</strong></span>.
</p><p>
Second, you need a linker -- <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span>, since assembler produces
only object code. Almost all distributions have <span class="application">gas</span>
and <span class="application">ld</span>, in the binutils package.
</p><p>
As for <span class="application">nasm</span>, you may have to download and install
binary packages for Linux and docs from the
<a class="link" href="#p-nasm-where" title="Where to find NASM">nasm site</a>; note that several distributions
(Stampede, Debian, SuSe, Mandrake) already have <span class="application">nasm</span>,
check first.
</p><p>
If you're going to dig in, you should also install include files for your OS,
and if possible, kernel source.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm853"></a>Hello, world!</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm855"></a>Program layout</h3></div></div></div><p>
Linux is 32-bit, runs in protected mode, has flat memory model, and uses the
ELF format for binaries.
</p><p>
A program can be divided into sections: <code class="literal">.text</code> for your code
(read-only), <code class="literal">.data</code> for your data (read-write),
<code class="literal">.bss</code> for uninitialized data (read-write); there can actually
be a few other standard sections, as well as some user-defined sections, but
there's rare need to use them and they are out of our interest here. A program
must have at least <code class="literal">.text</code> section.
</p><p>
Now we will write our first program. Here is sample code:
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm864"></a>NASM (hello.asm)</h3></div></div></div><p>

First step of building an executable is compiling (or assembling) object file
from the source:
</p><p>
For <span class="application">nasm</span> example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
$ nasm -f elf hello.asm

For <span class="application">gas</span> example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
$ as -o hello.o hello.S

This makes <code class="filename">hello.o</code> object file.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm887"></a>Producing executable</h3></div></div></div><p>
Second step is producing executable file itself from the object file by
invoking linker:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
$ ld -s -o hello hello.o
</pre><p>
</p><p>
This will finally build <code class="filename">hello</code> executable.

An answer from <a class="link" href="mailto:paulf@gam.co.za" target="_top">Paul Furber</a>:

</p><pre class="screen">
Ok you have a number of options to graphics in Linux. Which one you use
depends on what you want to do. There isn't one Web site with all the
information but here are some tips:

SVGALib: This is a C library for console SVGA access.
Pros: very easy to learn, good coding examples, not all that different
from equivalent gfx libraries for DOS, all the effects you know from DOS
can be converted with little difficulty.
Cons: programs need superuser rights to run since they write directly to
the hardware, doesn't work with all chipsets, can't run under X-Windows.
Search for svgalib-1.4.x on http://ftp.is.co.za

Framebuffer: do it yourself graphics at SVGA res
Pros: fast, linear mapped video access, ASM can be used if you want :)
Cons: has to be compiled into the kernel, chipset-specific issues, must
switch out of X to run, relies on good knowledge of linux system calls
and kernel, tough to debug
Examples: asmutils (http://www.linuxassembly.org) and the leaves example
and my own site for some framebuffer code and tips in asm
(http://ma.verick.co.za/linux4k/)

Xlib: the application and development libraries for XFree86.
Pros: Complete control over your X application
Cons: Difficult to learn, horrible to work with and requires quite a bit
of knowledge as to how X works at the low level. 
Not recommended but if you're really masochistic go for it. All the
include and lib files are probably installed already so you have what
you need. 

Low-level APIs: include PTC, SDL, GGI and Clanlib
Pros: very flexible, run under X or the console, generally abstract away
the video hardware a little so you can draw to a linear surface, lots of
good coding examples, can link to other APIs like OpenGL and sound libs,
Windows DirectX versions for free
Cons: Not as fast as doing it yourself, often in development so versions
can (and do) change frequently.
Examples: PTC and GGI have excellent demos, SDL is used in sdlQuake,
Myth II, Civ CTP and Clanlib has been used for games as well.

High-level APIs: OpenGL - any others?
Pros: clean api, tons of functionality and examples, industry standard
so you can learn from SGI demos for example
Cons: hardware acceleration is normally a must, some quirks between
versions and platforms
Examples: loads - check out www.mesa3d.org under the links section.

To get going try looking at the svgalib examples and also install SDL
and get it working. After that, the sky's the limit.

How do I debug pure assembly code under Linux?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
There's an early version of the
<a class="link" href="http://ald.sourceforge.net" target="_top">Assembly Language Debugger</a>,
which is designed to work with assembly code,
and is portable enough to run on Linux and *BSD.
It is already functional and should be the right choice, check it out!
</p><p>
You can also try <span class="command"><strong>gdb</strong></span> ;).
Although it is source-level debugger, it can be used to debug
pure assembly code, and with some trickery you can make
<span class="command"><strong>gdb</strong></span> to do what you need
(unfortunately, nasm '-g' switch does not generate
proper debug info for gdb; this is nasm bug, I think).
Here's an answer from <a class="link" href="mailto:dl@gazeta.ru" target="_top">Dmitry Bakhvalov</a>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
Personally, I use gdb for debugging asmutils. Try this:
 
1) Use the following stuff to compile:
   $ nasm -f elf -g smth.asm
   $ ld -o smth smth.o

2) Fire up gdb:
   $ gdb smth

3) In gdb:
   (gdb) disassemble _start
   Place a breakpoint at _start+1 (If placed at _start the breakpoint
   wouldnt work, dunno why)
   (gdb) b *0x8048075

   To step thru the code I use the following macro:
   (gdb)define n
   &gt;ni
   &gt;printf "eax=%x ebx=%x ...etc...",$eax,$ebx,...etc...
   &gt;disassemble $pc $pc+15
   &gt;end

   Then start the program with r command and debug with n.

   Hope this helps.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
An additional note from ???:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
    I have such a macro in my .gdbinit for quite some time now, and it
    for sure makes life easier. A small difference : I use "x /8i $pc",
    which guarantee a fixed number of disassembled instructions. Then,
    with a well chosen size for my xterm, gdb output looks like it is
    refreshed, and not scrolling.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
If you want to set breakpoints across your code, you can just use
<code class="function">int 3</code> instruction as breakpoint
(instead of entering address manually in <span class="command"><strong>gdb</strong></span>).
</p><p>
If you're using <span class="application">gas</span>, you should consult
<span class="application">gas</span> and <span class="application">gdb</span> related

How do I access BIOS functions from Linux (BSD, BeOS, etc)?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Short answer is -- noway. This is protected mode, use OS services instead.
Again, you can't use <code class="function">int 0x10</code>,
<code class="function">int 0x13</code>, etc.
Fortunately almost everything can be implemented
by means of system calls or library functions.
In the worst case you may go through direct port access,
or make a kernel patch to implement needed functionality,
or use LRMI library to access BIOS functions.

Is it possible to write kernel modules in assembly?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
Yes, indeed it is. While in general it is not a good idea
(it hardly will speedup anything), there may be a need of such wizardy. 
The process of writing a module itself is not that hard - -
a module must have some predefined global function,
it may also need to call some external functions from the kernel.
Examine kernel source code (that can be built as module) for details.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, here's an example of a minimum dumb kernel module
(<code class="filename">module.asm</code>)
(source is based on example by mammon_ from APJ #8):
</p><p>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
section .text

	global init_module
	global cleanup_module
	global kernel_version

	extern printk

init_module:
	push	dword str1
	call	printk
	pop	eax
	xor	eax,eax
	ret

cleanup_module:
	push	dword str2
	call	printk
	pop	eax
	ret
	
str1		db	"init_module done",0xa,0
str2		db	"cleanup_module done",0xa,0

kernel_version	db	"2.2.18",0
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The only thing this example does is reporting its actions.
Modify <code class="filename">kernel_version</code> to match yours, and build module with:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
$ nasm -f elf -o module.m module.asm
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
$ ld -r -o module.o module.m
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Now you can play with it using <span class="command"><strong>insmod/rmmod/lsmod</strong></span>
(root privilidged are required); a lot of fun, huh?

I can't understand how to use <code class="function">select</code> system call!

An answer from <a class="link" href="mailto:mochel@transmeta.com" target="_top">Patrick Mochel</a>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
When you call sys_open, you get back a file descriptor, which is simply an
index into a table of all the open file descriptors that your process has.
stdin, stdout, and stderr are always 0, 1, and 2, respectively, because
that is the order in which they are always open for your process from there.
Also, notice that the first file descriptor that you open yourself (w/o first
closing any of those magic three descriptors) is always 3, and they increment
from there.

Understanding the index scheme will explain what select does. When you
call select, you are saying that you are waiting certain file descriptors
to read from, certain ones to write from, and certain ones to watch from
exceptions from. Your process can have up to 1024 file descriptors open,
so an fd_set is just a bit mask describing which file descriptors are valid
for each operation. Make sense?

Since each fd that you have open is just an index, and it only needs to be
on or off for each fd_set, you need only 1024 bits for an fd_set structure.
1024 / 32 = 32 longs needed to represent the structure.

Now, for the loose example.
Suppose you want to read from a file descriptor (w/o timeout).

- Allocate the equivalent to an fd_set.  

.data

my_fds: times 32 dd 0

- open the file descriptor that you want to read from.

- set that bit in the fd_set structure.

   First, you need to figure out which of the 32 dwords the bit is in.  

   Then, use bts to set the bit in that dword. bts will do a modulo 32
   when setting the bit. That's why you need to first figure out which
   dword to start with.

   mov edx, 0
   mov ebx, 32
   div ebx

   lea ebx, my_fds
   bts ebx[eax * 4], edx

- repeat the last step for any file descriptors you want to read from.

- repeat the entire exercise for either of the other two fd_sets if you want action from them.

That leaves two other parts of the equation - the n paramter and the timeout
parameter. I'll leave the timeout parameter as an exercise for the reader
(yes, I'm lazy), but I'll briefly talk about the n parameter.

It is the value of the largest file descriptor you are selecting from (from
any of the fd_sets), plus one. Why plus one? Well, because it's easy to
determine a mask from that value. Suppose that there is data available on
x file descriptors, but the highest one you care about is (n - 1). Since
an fd_set is just a bitmask, the kernel needs some efficient way for
determining whether to return or not from select. So, it masks off the bits
that you care about, checks if anything is available from the bits that are
still set, and returns if there is (pause as I rummage through kernel source).
Well, it's not as easy as I fantasized it would be. To see how the kernel
determines that mask, look in fs/select.c in the kernel source tree.

Anyway, you need to know that number, and the easiest way to do it is to save
the value of the last file descriptor open somewhere so you don't lose it.

Ok, that's what I know. A warning about the code above (as always) is that
it is not tested. I think it should work, but if it doesn't let me know.
But, if it starts a global nuclear meltdown, don't call me. ;-)

    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</p><p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</span></dt><dd><p>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</p><p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</p><p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</p><p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p><p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p><p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p><p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</p><p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2. VERBATIM COPYING</span></dt><dd><p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</span></dt><dd><p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">4. MODIFICATIONS</span></dt><dd><p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</p></li></ol></div><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties- -for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</span></dt><dd><p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p></dd><dt><span class="term">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</span></dt><dd><p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</span></dt><dd><p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">8. TRANSLATION</span></dt><dd><p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">9. TERMINATION</span></dt><dd><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</span></dt><dd><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">How to use this License for your documents</span></dt><dd><p>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
