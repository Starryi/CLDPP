<EM>This HOWTO discusses essential do's and dont's for the <CODE>ftape</CODE>
floppy tape driver under Linux. It focusses on the newest version
which is <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> at the time of this writing. This HOWTO is to
be intended as first step help and source of information.
The <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver interfaces to QIC-40, QIC-80, QIC-3010 and
QIC-3020 compatible drives, and to the Iomega Ditto 2GB and Ditto Max
drives.  The QIC-3010 and QIC-3020 standards are also known as
`Travan' (TR-2 and TR-3).  These drives connect via the floppy disk
controller (<B>FDC</B>) which may be either an internal FDC or inside of
certain parallel port floppy tape drives. Please refer to the section
<A HREF="#supp_drives">Supported drives</A> for further
information.
<CODE>ftape</CODE> <B>does not</B> cover SCSI or QIC-02 tape drives.  DAT tape
drives usually (always?) connect to a SCSI controller.
This is but one of the Linux HOWTO documents.  You can get an index of
the HOWTOs from 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html">the Linux HOWTO index</A>, while the real HOWTO's can be fetched (using
<CODE>ftp</CODE>) from <CODE>sunsite.unc.edu:pub/Linux/doc/HOWTO</CODE> (this is
the ``official'' place) or via the World Wide Web from

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What is <CODE>ftape</CODE></A>
</H2>


<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> is a driver program that controls various low-cost tape
drives that connect to the floppy controller.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> is not a backup program as such; it is a device driver,
which allows you to use the tape drive (just like the SoundBlaster 16
driver let you use your sound card) through the device files
<CODE>/dev/[n]qft[0-3]</CODE>.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> was originally written by Bas Laarhoven
<CODE>&lt;bas@vimec.nl&gt;</CODE>, with ``a little help from his friends'' to
sort out the ECC (Error Correcting Code) stuff. <CODE>ftape</CODE> is
copyrighted by Bas under the GNU General Public License, which
basically says: ``go ahead and share this with the world, just don't
disallow other people from copying it further''.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> has undergone several changes since then. While the
Linux-2.0.x kernel series still contains <CODE>ftape-2.08</CODE> the v2.1.x
and soon the v2.2.* kernel series come with <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> (hopefully
even with <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE>, but this wasn't clear at the time of this
writing) which differs in some points from the <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> driver.
Since version <CODE>3.00</CODE> the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver has been maintained by
me (Claus-Justus Heine); it has been changed and improved in several
respects and support for new hardware has been added.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> is quite stable, and has been that for some time now.  It
is reliable enough for critical backups (but it's always a good idea
to check your backups, so you won't get a nasty surprise some day).</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> supports drives that conform to the QIC-117 and one of the
QIC-80, QIC-40, QIC-3010, and QIC-3020 standards as well as the Iomega
Ditto 2GB and Ditto Max drives which no longer strictly conform to the
QIC standards in all respects.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> can drive floppy tape drives that connect to the internal FDC 
as well as certain parallel port floppy tape drives.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> supports neither QIC-02, IDE (ATAPI), nor SCSI tape
drives.  SCSI drives are accessed as <CODE>/dev/[n]st[0-7]</CODE> and are
supported by the kernel through the SCSI drivers.  If you look for
help on SCSI tape drives, you should read the <CODE>SCSI-howto</CODE>.
ATAPI tape drives are supported by the kernel since 1.3.46.  See
section 
<A HREF="#supp_drives">Supported drives</A> and 
<A HREF="#unsupp_drives">Unsupported drives</A> for a list of supported
and unsupported drives.</P>

<H2><A NAME="getting"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Getting <CODE>ftape</CODE></A>
</H2>


<P>The v2.0.x versions of the kernel include version 2.08 of <CODE>ftape</CODE> I
recommend, however, that you grab the latest version of the full source
code package for <CODE>ftape</CODE>. It is a newer version, includes files that
are not included in the kernel v2.0.X distribution, and includes much
better documentation about how to install <CODE>ftape</CODE>.
The v2.1.x and later versions of the kernel include the version 3.04
of <CODE>ftape</CODE>.</P>

<P>I recommend that you download the latest stable version of <CODE>ftape</CODE>
which is 4.02 at the time of this writing and is available from</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/archives.html">http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/archives.html</A></P>
<P>as well as from</P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes/</A>.</P>
<P>You probably should also grab the <CODE>ftape-doc</CODE> and the
<CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package that are available from the same locations.</P>
<P>If you still want to use the <CODE>ftape-2.08</CODE> which is shipped with the
v2.0.x kernels, then you get a version of the driver which is really
out of date and doesn't support QIC-3020 tapes at 2Mbps correctly,
neither does it support the Ditto 2GB drives nor the Ditto Max drives
nor any kind of parallel port tape drive. The section
<A HREF="#supp_drives">Supported drives</A>
gives detailed information about which version of the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver
supports which hardware.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Differences between <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE>, <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> versions</A>
</H2>


<P><CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> use the file system interface that
was implemented for a branch release which was called
<CODE>zftape</CODE>. Actually, the module that implements the <B>VFS</B>
(<CODE>Virtual File System</CODE>) interface of <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and
<CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> still is called <CODE>zftape.o</CODE> and its <CODE>C</CODE>-sources
inside the kernel tree reside in
<CODE>[/usr/src/linux/]drivers/char/ftape/zftape/</CODE>.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> (i.e. the version still contained in the v2.0.x kernel)
uses another file system interface, that was implemented by
<CODE>ftape's</CODE> original author Bas Larhoven.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>File Marks</B><DD>
<P>The conceptional difference between <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> and later versions
of <CODE>ftape</CODE> is the way <EM>file marks</EM> are implemented.</P>
<P><EM>Floppy tape devices</EM> don't have real file marks.
<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>File
marks</B> are used to distinguish different backup sets if you write
multiple backup sets to a tape. SCSI and QIC-150 tapes have
<EM>real</EM> file marks, i.e. between two different backup sets there
is a region on the tape that is written special data to so that the
drive logic can detect that marker when the tape is wound with
(possibly) high speed over those file marks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 Because the goal
of <CODE>ftape's</CODE> file system interface was from the beginning on to
provide an interface that could be used with standard Unix-like tape
utilities (i.e. <CODE>mt</CODE>) the developers of <CODE>ftape</CODE> started to
emulate file marks by storing the positions on the tape where a file
mark should be located in certain fields of the header
segments.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>header segments</B> refers to a region at the
beginning of the tape sized two times 29k to hold some important
information about the tape format and size and some status
information.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>However, the <CODE>QIC</CODE> standards already designate a special region to
store such information in, the so called <B>volume table
segment</B>. Since <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> this <EM>volume table segment</EM> is used
instead of using unused data fields in the header segment. As a result
it is possible to use your tape cartridge with different operating
systems in the sense that your Win or DOS backup program will realize
that certain regions of the tape cartridge are already occupied with
data, and <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and later will detect the regions used by
those DOS and Win programs. However, you can't extract a DOS backup
set under Linux or extract a volume written by <CODE>ftape</CODE> under DOS,
safe you write your own software to do that.</P>

<DT><B>IOCTL interface</B><DD>
<P>There are certain differences in the <B>IOCTL</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This <EM>IO
control</EM> interface is used by e.g. <CODE>mt</CODE> to rewind the tape or skip
to the next file mark or do any other tape operation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

interface between <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> and <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and later. A
detailed description can be found in the <CODE>ftape-manual</CODE> contained
in the <CODE>ftape-doc</CODE> package.  See 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting Ftape</A>.</P>

<DT><B>Formatting</B><DD>
<P>Formatting of cartridges is supported with <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and later
<B>only</B>. Please get the <CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package that contains the
<CODE>ftformat</CODE> program that interfaces to the driver to format
cartridges.  See 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting Ftape</A>. The
<CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package comes with (more or less) detailed
documentation, so the case of formatting cartridges is not dealt with
in this document.</P>

<DT><B>Compression</B><DD>
<P><CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> supported user transparent on-the-fly compression in
software. This feature (or <EM>bug</EM>) has vanished in <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> as
it made further improvements concerning the realiability of backups
very very hard. This means, <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> comes without compression
support.</P>
<P>However <B>de-compression</B> of compressed archives produced with
<CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> <B>is</B> supported in order not to brake existing backup
programs where a user-level filter would not suffice to preserve
compatibility. Think, e.g., of <CODE>taper</CODE> which calls the <CODE>MTIOC</CODE>
ioctls itself instead of relying on the <CODE>mt</CODE> program to perform
tape operations.</P>

</DL>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>ftape-manual</CODE> contained in the <CODE>ftape-doc</CODE> package contains
much more detailed information about <CODE>ftape`s</CODE> file system
interface as well as implementation notes which by far exceed the
scope of this HOWTO. See 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting Ftape</A> for
informations about where to obtain the manual.</P>



<H2><A NAME="inst20"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Installing the driver with v2.0.x and earlier kernels</A>
</H2>


<P>The following section provides some useful information to get you
going with the installation of v4.x which is <B>not</B> shipped with the
kernel source tree yet but has to be downloaded separately, see the
section 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting ftape</A> above.</P>
<P>Once you've downloaded the source code (probably
<CODE>ftape-4.02-tar.gz</CODE>), untar it.  You can do this by determining what
directory you want the source code to be located in.  I recommend
<CODE>/usr/src/</CODE> or <CODE>~/src</CODE>.  When the tar file is extracted,
it will dump everything into a <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> subdirectory, so that
you'll end up, in the example I've given, with something like
<CODE>/usr/src/ftape-4.02</CODE> or <CODE>~/src/ftape-4.02</CODE>.</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> you cannot compile <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> into your v2.0.x
kernel. Instead, configure your kernel to <B>not</B> compile the
<CODE>ftape</CODE> driver and follow the installation instructions in the
<CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> distribution and install <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> as a module.</P>
<P>Read the <CODE>README</CODE> file.  The <CODE>README</CODE> is required reading.  It's
the top of the tree, so to speak.  If there are specific files that
the <CODE>README</CODE> tells you to read then read them.  It will make the
process much less complicated.</P>
<P>Do NOT proceed with compiling the package until you have read the
appropriate <CODE>README</CODE> files and the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file.</P>
<P>Afterwards you need to edit the <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> file and configure you
package according to your hardware. The <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> file contains lots
of explanations so it should be fairly easy to go along with it.</P>
<P>However, most of the hardware configuration can be done via setting
parameters during module load time so most parameters specified in the
file <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> simply give the default configuration, but you don't
need to recompile the driver to change IO addresses or interrupt
settings. The file <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> and the file <CODE>modules/insert</CODE>
contain examples how to specify the proper module parameters when
loading the kernel modules, so I won't go into further detail here.</P>
<P>If you are using a Linux-v1.3.x kernel, you should consider moving to
v2.0.x.  v1.3.x was the development release prior to the production
release v2.0.x.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Installing the driver with v2.1.x and later kernels</A>
</H2>


<P>
<H4>Comment</H4>
Maybe <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> will be included into the v2.2.x kernel, but
this isn't clear at the time of this writing. This HOWTO will be
revised appropriately when this has become clear. So long you have to
refer to the previous section 
<A HREF="#inst20">Installing the driver with v2.0.x and earlier kernels</A> and disregard the contents of
this section.</P>

<P>The Linux kernel v2.1.x and later already include <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> so you
don't need to download the <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> kernel driver package.</P>
<P><CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> as included in the v2.1.x versions of the kernel can be
completely configured using the kernel configuration menus (either with
<CODE>make menuconfig</CODE> or <CODE>make xconfig</CODE>. Also, there is online help
available that documents each parameter setting which I won't repeat
here.</P>
<P>The various boot- and loadtime parameter settings are explained in the
file </P>
<P><CODE>[/usr/src/linux/]Documentation/ftape.txt</CODE></P>
<P>of the Linux-v2.1.x and later kernel distributions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="tape-channel"></A> <A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Following the development of the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver</A>
</H2>


<P>If you want to follow the development of the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver, you
should subscribe to the Linux Tape mailing list

<P>Please note that I do not, repeat <B>DO NOT</B>, have any special

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Mixing <CODE>ftape</CODE> and floppies</A>
</H2>


<P>If you use your floppy tape drive with the standard FDC then the floppy
drive and the floppy tape drive cannot run concurrently as they share
the same hardware, the FDC, and the <CODE>floppy</CODE> and the <CODE>ftape</CODE>
driver do not talk to each other.  Thus, if you have mounted a floppy
and then try to access the tape drive, <CODE>ftape</CODE> will complain that it
cannot grab IRQ6 and then die.  This is especially a problem when
designing a emergency disk for use with ftape.  This solution is to
either load the boot/root disk into a ramdisk and then unmount the
floppy, or have two floppy drive controllers.</P>

<P>Before a tape can be used, it must be formatted.  The formatting
process lays out sector information onto the tape.  Other tape
interfaces don't typically require formatting.  The reason floppy
tapes do is that they need to look like a floppy (kinda gross, but
what the hey - it works :-).</P>


<H3>Can I format my tapes under Linux?</H3>


<P>Yes, you can, if you use <CODE>ftape-3.04d</CODE> or above. To format a floppy
tape cartridge you need a user level tool called <CODE>ftformat</CODE> as well
which is contained in the <CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> distribution (see section
<A HREF="#getting">Getting ftape</A>).</P>
<P>The <CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package comes with its own manual, so I do not need 
to repeat here how to use <CODE>ftformat</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Which formatting programs can I use under DOS?</H3>


<P>The following are known to work:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Colorado Memory System's software (<CODE>tape.exe</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Conner Backup Basics v1.1 and all Windows versions</LI>
<LI> Norton Backup</LI>
<LI> QICstream version 2</LI>
<LI> Tallgrass FileSecure v1.52</LI>
<LI> Escom Powerstream 3.0 (<CODE>qs3.exe</CODE> -- QICstream v3?)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>These programs are known to be more or less buggy:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Conner Backup Basics 1.0</LI>
<LI> Colorado Windows tape program</LI>
<LI> CP Backup (wastes tape space, but is OK apart from that)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As a general rule, most software under DOS should work.  The Conner
Backup Basics v1.0 has a parameter off by one (someone could not read
the QIC-80 specs right!), which is corrected in version 1.1.  However,
<CODE>ftape</CODE> detects this, and will work around it.  Dennis T. Flaherty
(<CODE>&lt;dennisf@denix.elk.miles.com&gt;</CODE>) report that Conner C250MQ
owners can obtain the new v1.1, by calling Conner at 1-800-4Conner (in
the US) and ask for an upgrade (for a nominal fee for the floppy).
The Windows versions should work fine.  Some versions of Colorado's
tape program for windows, has an off-by-one error in the number of
segments. <CODE>ftape</CODE> also detect and work around that bug.</P>
<P>Central Point Backup can be used, but it wastes precious tape space
when it encounters a bad spot on the tape.</P>
<P>NOTE: If you are running a formatting software under DOS, which is not
mentioned here, please mail the relevant info to me (
<A HREF="mailto:heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de">&lt;heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de&gt;</A>), so I can update the list.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Retensioning</A>
</H2>


<P>QIC tapes are particularly sensitive to tape stretch.  The reason is
that floppy tapes are pre-formatted with sector information, whereas
other tape types have their sync information written as the data is
written to the tape.  If the floppy tape stretches and the sync fields
get out of sync the result will be read errors.  The problem is worse
with longer tapes.</P>
<P>It is a good idea to retension new tapes a few times before using them
and before formatting them.  You should also try retensioning the tape
if you are start getting read errors.  It might also be a good idea
retension the tape before a backup.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Drive Cleaning</A>
</H2>


<P>The coating on the tape is an oxide compound.  As the tape is dragged
across the tape head it has a tendency to leave tiny amounts of
residue on the head.  You should periodically use a tape cleaner -
following the specs for the drive in question.  Tape cleaners should
be available from any distributer of tapes.</P>
<P>One more additional note about tape cleaning.  You might want to clean
the drive after the first use of a brand new tape.  A brand new tape
will typically leave quite a bit of residue the first time it's used.</P>
<P>Thanks to 
<A HREF="mailto:nealf@rcs.ee.washington.edu">Neal Friedman</A> for the explanation and suggestion that this information be
included in the HOWTO.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Repairing de-spooled cartridges</A>
</H2>


<P>In rare occasions it can happen that the tape drive doesn't detect the
<B>EOT</B> (End Of Tape) markers correctly. These markers are simply
holes in the tape which are detected by the tape drive with means of a
little photo-transistor (or the like).</P>
<P>The manual of your tape drive will probably give you proper hints how
to clean those EOT detectors.</P>
<P>However, if the EOT detection fails, then the tape drive despooles the
cartridge because the tape isn't glued to the wheels, but hold by
friction only.</P>
<P>There are detailed instructions how to fix such a despooled tape at
the Iomega WWW pages at</P>

<P>Works with 3M Travan 400M (TR-1) tapes with 120M tapes.  Also reported
that mt dies, but with backups using tar it works ok.  With cpio,
ftape is recommended rather than zftape.

<P>Problems have been reported with the drive continually stopping and
starting with zftape (&lt;75104.1756@compuserve.com&gt;).  This appears
to be a problem with the tape going too fast for the computer; the DMA
buffers are getting flushed before getting filled again.  Newer
versions of zftape don't do this any more is a suitably fast backup
program or large DMA buffers are used

Write errors need not be caused by the tape drive, but also by bad
tape cartridges. Frequent repositioning can be caused by bad
cartridges, too, but can also be caused by overrun errors which would
indicate that the FDC and DMA controller have problems to talk to each
other.

be changed (incremented by 1, channel2?, Modify the Makefile).  You
then need to modify the ftape Makefile to reflect this change.
However, ftape seems to be a bit flaky with this (no version number
supplied) (&lt;ttait@tiac.net&gt;).  It may not work at 2Mbps

</P>
<P>Another problem has been reported with writing archives (with dd) to
the tape.  It may start fine, but when the driver catches up with dd,
it stops the tape and rewinds it to the beginning.  Then it starts
winding on through the tape ad infinitum.  It appears to occur when
the driver asks the tape to pause which should cause the tape to move
back by 3 segments, but instead is moves back to the beginning of the
tape.  A bug fix submitted is reported to not solve the problem.</P>

Should have been fixed somewhere between <CODE>ftape-3.00</CODE> and

<CODE>Makefile</CODE> files in the <CODE>ftape</CODE> distribution.  Since of version

<H3>Iomega Tape Accelerator II</H3>


<P>To use the Iomega Tape Accelerator II (<B>not</B> to be mistaken as the

I/O base, IRQ and DMA.  This works (by the empirical testing of Scott
Bailey 
<A HREF="mailto:sbailey@xcc.mc.xerox.com">&lt;sbailey@xcc.mc.xerox.com&gt;</A>), with at least
<CODE>ftape-2.02</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Iomega Ditto Dash and other 2Mbps controllers</H3>

<P>This controller requires the use of e.g. the <CODE>isapnptools</CODE> package to

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/">http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/</A></P>

controller at 4Mbps. 3Mbps seems to  be fine.</P>
<P>If you configure the Ditto EZ to use DMA 2 (the DMA channel used by
the floppy controller) then your floppy drive will no longer work. It
doesn't help to disable the controllers DMA gate (as is the case with

<CODE>gzip</CODE>ped <CODE>tar</CODE> files, all data after the point of the error is
lost! (to me, this is a pretty good reason for NOT using compression
on backups).  The choice of which is most appropriate depends on the
situation and the features and malfeatures of each of the packages.  I
recommend taking a look at each package at reviewing the options that
each provides.  It's possible that this HOWTO may provide more detail
on this subject at some point in the future.</P>
<P>There are more links pointing to backup software at
<A HREF="http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/">http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/</A> in the

<P>To make a backup of your kernel source tree using <CODE>tar</CODE>, do this
(assuming you have the sources in <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE>):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # cd /usr/src
        # tar cf /dev/ftape linux
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will not compress the files, but gives you a smoother tape run.
If you want the compression (and you've got <CODE>tar</CODE> 1.11.2), you
just include the <CODE>-z</CODE> flag(*), eg: `<CODE>tar czf /dev/ftape
linux</CODE>'</P>
<P>For further instructions on how to use <CODE>tar</CODE>, <CODE>dd</CODE> and
<CODE>mt</CODE> look at the man pages and the texinfo files that comes
with the respective distributions.</P>
<P>(*) <CODE>tar</CODE> assumes that the first argument is options, so the
`<CODE>-</CODE>' is not necessary, i.e. these two commands are the same:
`<CODE>tar xzf /dev/ftape</CODE>' and `<CODE>tar -xzf /dev/ftape</CODE>'</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Restoring an archive</A>

<P>OK, let us restore the backup of the kernel source you made in section
<A HREF="#write-backup">Writing an archive to a tape</A> above.  To
do this you simply say</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        tar xf /dev/ftape

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you used compression, you will have to say</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        tar xzf /dev/ftape
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>When you use compression, <CODE>gzip</CODE> will complain about trailing

`broken pipe' message).  This can be safely ignored.</P>
<P>For the other utilities, please read the man page.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Testing the archive</A>

<P>tar has an option (<CODE>-d</CODE>) for detecting differences between two

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Putting more than one backup on a tape</A>
</H2>



<P>To put more than one backup on a tape you must have the <CODE>mt</CODE>
utility. You will probably have it already, if you got one of the
mainline distributions (eg. Slackware or Debian).</P>
<P>Programs like <CODE>tar</CODE> and <CODE>cpio</CODE> generate a single Tape ARchive
and know nothing about multiple files or positioning of a tape, it
just reads or writes from/to a device. <CODE>mt</CODE> knows everything about
moving the tape back and forth, but nothing about reading the data off
the tape.  As you might have guessed, combining <CODE>tar</CODE> or <CODE>cpio</CODE>
with <CODE>mt</CODE> does the trick.</P>
<P>By using the <CODE>nqft[0-3]</CODE> (<CODE>nftape</CODE>) device, you can use
`<CODE>mt</CODE>' to position the tape the correct place (`<CODE>mt -f
/dev/nqft0 fsf 2</CODE>' means step over two ``file marks'', i.e.
<CODE>tar</CODE> files) and then use <CODE>tar</CODE> or <CODE>cpio</CODE> to read or write
the relevant data.</P>
<P>The most common use of the non-rewinding device is to append another
backup to an existing tape.  Here are the specific steps with a little
explanation thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Insert a tape into the drive.  On some devices this may cause
the tape to be rewound.
</LI>
<LI> Issue an End-of-Tape command to the NON-rewinding device.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mt -f /dev/n???? eof
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


The tape should now be positioned at the End-of-Data (<B>EOD</B>). The
tape won't move unless a program opens the device, closes the rewinding
device, removes the device driver from kernel memory (rmmod) or ejects
the tape.  Using `<CODE>mt eof</CODE>' may be faster on QIC tapes.
</LI>
<LI> The next tape operation will start at the EOD mark.  If you
perform a write, it will append a new `file'.  If you perform a read it
will fail with EOF.  The EOD mark on most tape formats is actually two
consecutive EOF marks, however, since version 3.xx <CODE>ftape </CODE> uses the
volume table as specified in the <CODE>QIC-113</CODE> standard to emulate file
marks, thus there aren't two consecutive file marks at EOD. Writing the
EOF marks is handled by either the device driver or the hardware when a
close() is performed.
</LI>
<LI> Here's where you write the actual data to the tape.
</LI>
<LI> Here's the important part. <B>Now rewind the tape</B>.  Both
<CODE>ftape</CODE> caches some information that belongs in the header segments
on the tape and update those header segments <B>only when the tape is
rewound</B>.  This caching is necessary because rewinding the tape and
updating the header segments takes a conspicuous amount of time.  The
drawback of this caching is that you will lose information if you have
written to the tape and not rewound the device.
</LI>
</UL>

</H2>


<P>``Is there a way to extend an archive -- put a file on the tape, then
later, add more to the tape?''</P>
<P>No. The <CODE>tar</CODE> documentation will tell you to use `<CODE>tar -Ar</CODE>',

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Mount/unmounting tapes</A>

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Creating an emergency boot floppy for <CODE>ftape</CODE></A></H2>


<P>
<H4>Comment</H4>
As of the time of this writing (August 1998) I remember that I have read
about several emergency disk sets in the <B>c.o.l.a</B>
(<CODE>comp.os.linux.announce</CODE>) news group since the time this section has
been written. Some of those packages actually might produce rather
sophisticated emergency boot floppy sets. Please check out yourself.  I
didn't try to create an emergency boot floppy with recent versions of
<CODE>ftape</CODE>.</P>

<P>This section was written by Claus T&oslash;ndering
<CODE>&lt;ct@login.dknet.dk&gt;</CODE>.</P>
<P>Once you are the happy owner of a tape drive and several tapes full of
backups, you will probably ask yourself this question: ``If everything
goes wrong, and I completely lose my hard disk, how do I restore my
files from tape?''</P>
<P>What you need is an emergency floppy disk that contains enough files
to enable you to boot Linux and restore your hard disk from tape.</P>
<P>The first thing you should do is to read ``The Linux Bootdisk HOWTO''
written by Graham Chapman 
<A HREF="mailto:grahamc@zeta.org.au">&lt;grahamc@zeta.org.au&gt;</A>.  That document tells you almost
everything you need to know about making an emergency floppy boot kit.
The paragraphs below contain a few extra pieces of information that
will make your life a bit easier when you follow Graham Chapman's
procedures:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>    You don't really need <CODE>/etc/init</CODE>, <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>, 
<CODE>/etc/getty</CODE>, and <CODE>/etc/rc.d/*</CODE> on your floppy disk.  If
Linux doesn't find <CODE>/etc/init</CODE>, it will start <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>
on your console, which is fine for restoring your system.  Deleting
these files gives you extra space on your floppy, which you will
probably need.</LI>
<LI>    Find a small version of <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>.  They are frequently
available on the boot floppies that come with a Linux distribution.
This again will give you extra space.  I'd suggest <CODE>ash</CODE>, which
is extremely small (approx 62Kbytes), and yet very <CODE>bash</CODE>
compatible.</LI>
<LI>    The <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> you include on your floppy disk should look
something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        /dev/fd0        /               minix   defaults
        none            /proc           proc    defaults
        /dev/hda        /mnt            ext2    defaults
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once you have booted from your floppy, give the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mount -av
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>    Make sure your floppy drive is not mounted when you access the
streamer tape!  Otherwise you may get the following error message:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        Unable to grab IRQ6 for ftape driver
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This means that you <B>MUST</B> load the floppy into a RAMDISK.

This has the unfortunate consequence that the programs needed to
restore the files from the tape can not be located on a separate
floppy disk.  You have two options here:
<OL>
<LI>    You place <CODE>tar</CODE> (or <CODE>cpio</CODE> or <CODE>afio</CODE> or
whatever other backup program you use) on your root floppy
disk.  (This is where you'll need all the extra space created
in the steps above.) </LI>
<LI>    Before you start restoring from tape, copy <CODE>tar</CODE> (or
<CODE>cpio</CODE> or <CODE>afio</CODE> or whatever) to your hard disk
and load it from there.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>    Apart from your backup program, you will probably need <CODE>mt</CODE> on
your root floppy as well.</LI>
<LI>    Make sure your ftape device (typically <CODE>/dev/nqft0</CODE>) is present
on your boot floppy.</LI>
<LI>    Finally: <B>TRY IT OUT!</B> Of course, I don't recommend that you
destroy your hard disk contents to see if you are able to restore
everything.  What I do recommend, however, is that you try booting
from your emergency disks and make sure that you can at least make a
file listing of the contents of your backup tape.</LI>

<P>Always the latest stable version which is _supposed_ to be available from
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes</A>
and

</H2>


<P>The default version of <EM>Ftape</EM> included in the 2.0.xx kernel sources is   
2.08 or 2.09 and is very out of date.  Please update the <EM>Ftape drivers</EM>   
to the latest from the

<P>&lt;answer from Tim Jones&gt;</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3 I'm running Linux/SMP and the system just freezes when trying to access the Ftape devices!</A>
</H2>


<P>You need to add <CODE>-D__SMP__</CODE> to the <CODE>KERNEL_OPT</CODE> variable in the
file <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE>. In newer <CODE>ftape</CODE> versions you only need to
uncomment a certain line in the <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> file.</P>
<P>&lt;answer from Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.4">10.4 Why does depmod complain about "undefined symbols"?</A>
</H2>


<P>Ignore the depmod error messages. The problem is that the <EM>Ftape modules</EM>   
have to be compiled without the version checksum feature (i.e.   
<CODE>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</CODE>) with 2.0.* kernels. This causes no problem, even   
when the modules are used with a kernel that has support for this feature;   
only that <CODE>depmod</CODE> wrongly complains about undefined symbols. Ignore the   
complaints of <CODE>depmod</CODE> and try to insert the modules despite of these   
complaints: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

If this fails, something is wrong.</P>
<P>&lt;answer from Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.5">10.5 "insmod" says the kernel version is wrong</A>
</H2>


<P>The <CODE>insmod</CODE> program can check the kernel version against the
version that <EM>Ftape</EM> was compiled for in two ways: It can directly
compare the kernel version number recorded in the <EM>Ftape module</EM> against
the version of the running kernel, or, if both the kernel and
<EM>Ftape</EM> is compiled with versioned symbols, compare the version of
the used kernel symbols.</P>
<P>If you have upgraded your version of GCC to v2.7.0 or later, you must
recompile the modules utilities with gcc v2.7.x.</P>
<P>Newer versions of <CODE>insmod</CODE> allows you to "force" insertion of
a module into the kernel, even though the version string is incorrect.</P>
<P>&lt;from the Ftape-Howto&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.6">10.6 "insmod" says that kernel 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 differ</A>
</H2>


<P>Did you remember to apply the <CODE>ksyms.c</CODE> patch to the kernel?  If
not, read the <CODE>README.linux-1.2</CODE> file in the source distribution.</P>
<P>&lt;from the Ftape-Howto&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.7">10.7 Trying to compile Ftape gives me the error "modversions.h: no such file or directory"</A>
</H2>


<P>The <CODE>modversions.h</CODE> file is created when the kernel is compiled  
with the configuration item <CODE>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</CODE> turned on.  With  
this option enabled, the file will be created during the <CODE>make dep</CODE>  
step.</P>
<P>One more handy tip is that a <CODE>make mrproper</CODE> will remove  
<CODE>/usr/include/linux/modversions.h</CODE>.  You will need to reconfig  
the kernel and do a <CODE>make dep</CODE> to get the file back.  </P>
<P>&lt;from the Ftape-Howto&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.8">10.8 What is this versioned symbols stuff anyway?</A>
</H2>


<P>When you say `yes' to <CODE>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</CODE> during `<CODE>make config</CODE>',  
all the symbols exported by the kernel, i.e: the symbols that the  
loadable modules can "see", are augmented to include a checksum  
across the types of the call/return parameters.  This allows  
<CODE>insmod</CODE> to detect whether the definition of a variable or function  
in the kernel has changed since the time when <EM>Ftape</EM> was compiled.</P>
<P>This ensures a high degree of safety, such that you do not crash the  
kernel because you used an outdated module with your kernel.</P>
<P>If you enable <CODE>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</CODE> in the kernel, make sure you have  
<PRE>
-DMODVERSIONS -include /usr/include/linux/modversions.h
</PRE>

uncommented in the MODULE_OPT line in the <EM>Ftape</EM> Makefile.  Conversely,   
if you do not have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled, make sure you have it  
commented out.</P>

<P>You are probably trying to use the same IRQ and DMA settings as your on-board

<H2><A NAME="ss10.11">10.11 Ftape DMA transfers gives ECC errors</A>
</H2>


<P>Sadly to say there are some SVGA cards and Ethernet cards that do not
decode their addresses correct.  This typically happens when the
<EM>Ftape</EM> buffers are in the range <CODE>0x1a0000</CODE> to <CODE>0x1c0000</CODE>.
Somehow, the DMA write cycles get clobbered and every other byte
written gets a bad value (<CODE>0xff</CODE>).  These problems are reported to
happen with both SVGA and Ethernet cards.  We know of at least one
(bad?) ATI 16bit VGA card that caused this.</P>
<P>The easiest solution is to put the card in an 8bit slot (it is often
not enough to reconfigure the card to 8bit transfers).  Moving the
<EM>Ftape</EM> buffer away from the VGA range is only a partial
solution; All DMA buffers used in Linux can have this problem!  Let us
make this one clear: This has nothing to do with the <EM>Ftape</EM>
software.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 How fast is Ftape ?</A>
</H2>


<P>You can achieve quite respectable backup and restore speeds with
<EM>Ftape</EM>: a Colorado DJ-20 and an Adaptec 1542CF controller, has
been measured at 4.25Mbyte/min sustained data transfer rate (no
compression) across a 70Mbyte tar archive, while comparing the archive
on the tape with data on an IDE disk.  The speed of <EM>Ftape</EM> is
mostly dependent on the data transfer rate of your FDC: The AHA1542CF
has a ``post-1991 82077'' FDC, and it will push 1Mbit/sec at the tape
drive.  If you have an FDC which can only deliver 500Kbit/sec data
rates, you will see half the transfer rate (well, roughly).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 When I write to some of my tapes, they seem to spend a lot of time "shoe-shining," or repositioning instead of streaming.  Is something wrong with my system?</A>
</H2>


<P>There has been a few reports of "shoeshining".  This is when the tape just  
seems to run back and forth endlessly.  This has been seen on a Jumbo  
250 (74407.3051@compuserve.com) and on an Iomega 250 Ditto Insider  
(tom@opus.cais.com). In the latter case it has been narrowed own to  
using an ELF Linux and running off a SCSI hard disk (connected to an  
Adaptec 1542cf).  Please contact me if you have an update to this  
problem.</P>
<P>&lt;from the Ftape-Howto&gt;</P>
<P>Probably not. If you are backing up a large number of &lt; 2K files, you're   
just going to have to live with it.  In this event, the repositions are caused  
by file system access overhead. If you are backing up a normal system's files,  
this may be caused by slop or media stretching in the tape cartridge. By   
simply retensioning the tape, you should see this go away. Try  
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ftmt -f /dev/zqft0 reten
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to retension the tape. If retensioning doesn't solve this, and it's only   
happening on certain tapes, it might be wise to replace the tapes in question.</P>
<P>&lt;answer from Tim Jones&gt;</P>
<P>If you use afio as your backup tool you can set it to write a very large   
number of buffers in one hit by using the -c flag. Make it large enough so   
that you supply enough data for most of a single end-to-end pass over the tape.
For my system, the following streams quite nicely - stopping relatively few  
times per tape pass on an unloaded system:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
find /usr/local -xdev -print | afio -o -v -f -b 10240 -c 800 /dev/qft0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In my case I'm writing 800 x 10240 bytes per tape write, i.e. about 8MB.   
haven't experimented that much with these settings - so someone might like   
to establish more optimal ones.</P>
<P>Presumably other backup utilities could be modified to use a similar technique.</P>
<P>&lt;answer by Michael Hamilton&gt;</P>
<P>GNU tar doesn't use buffering in this way. The commercial backup program   
"bru" is able to multi-buffer using shared memory; this works only when   
writing compressed archive with bru (regardless whether you use <EM>Ftape's</EM>   
builtin compression)</P>
<P>Another way to overcome the problem might be to use more dma buffers in the   
<EM>Ftape kernel driver</EM> like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/qft0 setdrvbuffer $((6*32786))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

$((6*32786)) should be expanded by your shell when using a Bourne  
compatible one. This has a negative impact on the system's memory pool:   
<EM>Ftape's</EM> dma buffers cannot be used by any other part of the kernel nor   
by any other application. And kernel memory cannot be swapped out. If you   
decide to use this kind of multi-buffering then you should unload the driver   
as soon as it isn't needed any longer.</P>

to switch <EM>Ftape</EM> to variable block size mode and be able to write the

work with this setting). When you intend to use "KBackup" then this is the   
only way to make it work together with <EM>Ftape</EM> (it _may_ work, don't know   
if it does)</LI>
<LI>tell your backup program about <EM>Ftape's</EM> default block size of 10k (which   
is also the default of GNU tar). For "afio" you can use the following command   
line switch:

<P>The "device busy" messages can only occur while the <EM>Ftape devices</EM> are

You can skip the "--block-compress" if using the most recent version  
of GNU tar.</P>
<P>However, this is not a bug of <EM>Ftape</EM>. It seems that the parent tar  
process exits before its child has closed the tape device. I know,  
however, from hacking the tar code ages ago, that tar properly waits  
for its parent to die.</P>
<P>However, the busy message simply means that the "busy" variable is

<P>If on uses tar with compression, then it forks a child which will

waited for by the parent tar, or if the wait() function also waits for
grand childs.</P>
<P>But this seems to be the problem: the parent tar already has exited
while its grandchild still is busy closing the archive. One hardly
will notice this problem if the close() happens fast (i.e. regular

<EM>Ftape</EM>, but either in the backup programs or in the kernel or maybe
libc exit code.</P>

no grandchild and the parent process properly waits for its childs

</H2>


<P>When using compression, and in all general, it can be a benefit to  
specify to <CODE>tar</CODE>, that it should block the output into chunks.  
Since <EM>Ftape</EM> cuts things into 29Kbyte blocks, saying `<CODE>-b58</CODE>'  
should be optimum.</P>
<P>"Why 29Kbyte?", I hear you cry.  Well, the QIC-80 standard specifies  
that all data should be protected by an Error Correcting Code (ECC)  
code.  The code specified in the QIC-80 standard is known as a  
Reed-Solomon (R-S) code.  The R-S code takes 29 data bytes and  
generates 3 parity bytes.  To increase the performance of the ECC  
code, the parity bytes are generated across 29 1Kbyte sectors.  Thus,  
<EM>Ftape</EM> takes 29Kbytes of data, adds 3Kbytes of ECC parity, and  
writes 32Kbytes to the tape at a time.  For this reason, <EM>Ftape</EM> will  
always read and write 32K byte blocks to be able to detect (and  
correct) data errors.</P>
<P>If you are curious, and wish to know more, look in the <CODE>ecc.c</CODE> and

<H2><A NAME="ss11.21">11.21 When I made backups before using taper, under the 2.0.29 ftape my drive didn't support fsf, under the new zftape it does, why would this be, and what exactly is fsf ?</A>
</H2>


<P>It probably didn't work before because you didn't use a 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/rft0 erase
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

before writing data to the cartridge. THIS ISN'T necessary any more.</P>
<P>But, hey, what does <I>mt fsf</I>? Tape drives don't store files in the
sense that you can use 
<PRE>
cp somefile /dev/my_what_ever_tape
</PRE>
 
or be able to mount the tape drive like you could mount a harddisk. 
You can't do nothing with a tape drive but write data to it in a sequential 
manner.</P>
<P>As this is quite inconvenient, somebody invented something which is
known under the name <I>file mark</I> or <I>eof mark</I> (eof == End Of
File). Those marks don't separate files that have been backed up to
the tape device, but only separate blocks of data (whatever data that
might be).</P>
<P>Normally, the kernel tape device drivers take care of writing file
marks when the tape device is closed, i.e.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cf /dev/nqft0 /bin
tar -cf /dev/nqft0 /etc
mt -f /dev/nqft0 rewind
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

would result in a backup of all files under <I>/bin</I> and <I>/etc</I>. When
the first <I>tar</I> finishes, the kernel driver will take care of writing
a file mark to the tape at the current tape position, and when the
second <I>tar</I> process has finished, another file mark is written to the
tape cartridge at that position.</P>
<P>Now, the sense of those file marks is, that it is possible to skip
between different archives on the tape more quickly than would be
possible with reading the data back.</P>
<P>The commands to do that are:
<DL>
<DT><B>mt fsf</B><DD>
<P>fast skip to the next file mark towards EOT (End Of Tape)</P>
<DT><B>mt bsf</B><DD>
<P>fast skip to the next file marks towards BOT (Begin Of Tape)</P>
</DL>

Thus, to extract the second archive in the example above, one doesn't
need to read the first archive back, but can proceed as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/nqft0 rewind
mt -f /dev/nqft0 fsf
tar -xvf /dev/nqft0

<P>&lt;Answer from Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.22">11.22 What exactly is the difference between ftape, and zftape?</A>
</H2>


<P>When <EM>Ftape</EM> was young there were two versions of the floppy tape
driver, one of them was called <EM>zftape</EM> because of its built-in
user-transparent on-the-fly compression. Whether such a thing is a
feature or a bug ('cause this needn't be done in kernel space) is
another question. However, the ioctl interface and file mark handling
provided by <EM>zftape</EM> was much better and had less bugs. And <EM>zftape</EM>
allows to use floppy tape cartridges with different OS. Well, you
can't exchange data, but <EM>zftape</EM> won't overwrite volumes created by
your Windoze program, and vice versa.</P>
<P>Nowadays, <EM>Ftape</EM> is name of the entire floppy tape driver package AND
<I>ftape.o</I> is the file-name of the kernel module that implements the
low-level hardware support. <EM>zftape</EM> has ceased to exist as a separate
package, but the new <EM>Ftape</EM> versions (since ftape-3.00) contain a
<EM>zftape.o</EM> module that needs to be loaded on top of <EM>ftape.o</EM>
(i.e. you need to load BOTH modules to be able to access your floppy
tape drive) and implements the file system interface and the advanced
(?) features of the previous verions <EM>zftape</EM>.</P>
<P>&lt;Answer from Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.23">11.23 What is the difference between a rewinding, and non rewinding drive?</A>
</H2>


<P>Well, the rewinding tape devices rewind the tape to BOT (Begin Of
Tape) when the device is closed, i.e.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cvf /dev/qft0 /bin
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will rewind the tape cartridge when the tar job has finished. In contrast, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cvf /dev/nqft0 /bin 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will NOT rewind the tape cartridge and leave the tape R/W head at its
current position.</P>
<P>Rewinding devices should be used when performing a single backup,
non-rewinding devices can be useful when doing multiple backups as one
doesn't need to space to EOM (End Of recorded Media) before appending
another archive.</P>
<P>Non-rewinding devices MUST be used when sending any of the tape motion
command to the tape drive, such as 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/nqft0 fsf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

, because when the <I>mt</I> process finishes then the tape device is closed  
which would result in rewinding the cartridge with the rewinding devices.</P>
<P>&lt;Answer from Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.24">11.24 Can someone tell me how to use mt to rewind my TR-3 drive one record using zftape record, so I can verify it?</A>
</H2>


<P>Well, it depends. If the tape is still positioned inside the volume  
just written, "mt bsf 1" (or equivalently "mt bsf") will backspace  
just to the beginning of that volume (this is how "tar --verify"  
works). If the tape is already positioned AFTER the filemark that  
marks the end of the last written volume, then you need to issue   
"mt bsf 2"</P>
<P>The logic behind this is as follows:
"MTBSF count" backspaces over count file marks, stops, and then  
positions on the <CODE>EOT</CODE> side of the last skipped file mark. This means,  
an "mt bsf 2" will position right at the beginning of the previous  
volume. </P>
<P>&lt;answer form Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.25">11.25 By non-rewinding, they mean that it doesn't automatically rewind, correct? It doesn't mean that under no circumstances it will rewind, right?  I tried using /dev/zqft0, and it instantly rewinds the tape.</A>
</H2>


<P>You are right: auto-rewind means, the tape is rewound when the tape  
device is closed, non-rewinding  means, the tape isn't automatically  
rewound when the tape device is closed (but you can, of course, use  
the tape motion commands BSF/FSF etc. to position the tape head at  
every position you like).</P>
<P>&lt;answer form Claus Heine&gt;</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.26">11.26 What is the difference between what mt considers a record and what it considers a file?</A>
</H2>


<P>A record is the minimal amount of bytes that will be accepted by the
tape in one read/write operation (except in "variable block size mode"
where it just should be the amount of data actually written in a
single write operation??). </P>
<P>For <EM>zftape</EM> every read and write access has to be a multiple of a fixed
block size (fixed, but tunable with <CODE>MTSETBLK</CODE>). This block size is a
"tape record" (as mentioned in the GNU mt man page and defaults to
10kb for <EM>zftape</EM>.</P>
<P>A "file" (in the sense of the mt man page) is a, well, misleading
terminus. What is meant is an area of the tape between two file
marks. This is not a file like a file on the file system, in the sense
that it could have a name, file access modes, could be moved or copied
with cp, mv, rm etc. </P>
<P>Instead, It simply is the area of the tape that was recorded in one
backup session, its end is marked by a tape file mark, and its
beginning is delimited by either <CODE>BOT</CODE> or the file mark of the previous
tape "file". That tape "files" are the things that can be skipped with
the <CODE>MTBSF/FSF</CODE> commands.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 What are good makers of Travan tapes?</A>
</H2>


<P>I was the UNIX Product Manager at Archive Corp (Prior to the Conner/Seagate   
mess) and we performed extensive tests of tape media for compatibility   
certification, including retentivity, flaking and length consistancy.  Based   
on the results of the tests, we selected the best of these certified   
manufacturers' products to private label as our own media.  Here is the   
order in which we selected vendors up through 1995 (when I lost contact   
with the ATI group):</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>QIC</B><DD>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> 3M (now known as Imation)</LI>
<LI> QMaxell/Sony (tie)</LI>
<LI> (BTW - Iomega uses Sony private-labelled media)</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<DT><B>4MM</B><DD>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Fuji</LI>
<LI> Maxell/Sony (tie - is this a trend?)</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<DT><B>8MM</B><DD>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Fuji/Exabyte - which we believed to be OEM'd Fuji (tie - so much for trend!)</LI>
<LI> Sony</LI>
<LI> Maxell</LI>

</P>
<DT><B>DLT</B><DD>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Maxell</LI>
<LI> Sony</LI>
</OL>
</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Otherwise, we had entries in our search from other vendors which were   
generally a private-labelled version of one of the major labels above. The   
exceptions were Verbatim and DIC.  Both of these manufacturer's media had   
fall-out rates and length discrepancies that were so high that we would not   
certify them and even warned customers about them indicating that we could   
not offer any sort of guarantee that they would get a good backup using the   
media from these manufacturers.</P>
<P>In addition, since coming to EST, I've found that Verbatim media is still   
not worth the money saved in purchasing it.  We have 11 of their TR-Extra   
and QIC-Extra (QICXL) tapes that were useless after fewer than 20 passes each.</P>
<P>While this is my personal opinion, it is based on over 9 years of experience   
with this very question, I strongly recommend Imation/3M media for QIC/Travan   
user, Fuji media 4MM users, Exabyte/Fuji for 8MM and DEC labelled media   
for DLT users.</P>

</H2>


<P>If you wish to help developing <EM>Ftape</EM>, or add some utility  
(e.g. a tape formatting program), you will need that appropriate QIC  
standards.  The standard(s) to get is: QIC-80, -117, -3010, and 3020.  
QIC-117 describes how commands are sent to the tape drive (including  
timing etc), so you would probably never need it.  QIC-80/3010/3020  
describes higher level part, such as tape layout, ECC code, standard  
filesystem.  You can get the QIC standards from the following address:  </P>

<P>&lt;answer from Tim Jones&gt;</P>
<P>As the Ditto 2GB is a Tr-3 tape (though it can only store 1GB instead of the  
1.6GB you get with a regular Tr-3 drive) you need an FDC (FDC means: Floppy  
Disk Controller) that is capable of at 1Mbit/sec transfer rate. You don't need  
to worry about this if you have an accellerator card (i.e. the Ditto Dash  
controller). Otherwise try to purchase an FDC that claims to be capable of  
driving 2.88Mb floppies because this implies that the FDC is capable of 1Mbit  
transfer rate.</P>

when you are running <CODE>ftape</CODE>, and you can show that it is
<CODE>ftape</CODE> that is messing things up, regard it as a Bug That Should
Be Fixed.  Mail the details to the maintainer
(<CODE>&lt;heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de&gt;</CODE>) and to the tape list.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss14.2">14.2 OK, it's a bug ...ehhh... feature - How do I submit a report?</A>
</H2>


<P>First, make sure you can reproduce the problem.  Spurious errors are a
pain in the ass, since they are just about impossible to hunt down
<CODE>:-/</CODE> This is a quick check list:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Kernel version, and patches applied</LI>
<LI> <CODE>ftape</CODE> version</LI>
<LI> tape drive model / manufacturer</LI>
<LI> Expansion bus type (EISA, ISA, PCI, or VL-bus)</LI>
<LI> What you did to expose the problem</LI>
<LI> What went wrong on your system.</LI>
<LI> Do not delete the kernel and the <CODE>ftape.o</CODE> file. I might want
you run try some patches out or run a different test on your system.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Increase the tracing level to 4 or 5 and run the command that caused
problems again (don't do it if your fear that you loose data or damage
your hardware, there is absolutely no warranty for neither data loss
nor hardware damage caused by <CODE>ftape</CODE>, remember this). Increasing
the trace level beyond 5 probably doesn't make any sense as it affects
the timing of the driver in a way that it doesn't work well any
more. Get the tracing data from the kernel log or <CODE>/proc/kmsg</CODE>,
depending on where you harvest your error messages.  Try to look at
what <CODE>ftape</CODE> spews out at you.  It may look in-comprehensible to
you at first, but you can get valuable information from the logfile.
Most messages have a function name prepended, to make it easier to
locate the problem.  Look through the source, don't just cry
``WOLF!'', without giving it a try.  If your version of the kernel (or
<CODE>ftape</CODE> for that matter), is ``old'', when compared to the newest
version of the kernel, try to get a newer (or even the newest) kernel
and see if the problem goes away under the new kernel.  When you post
your problem report, include the information about ftape version,
kernel version, expansion bus type (ISA, VL-bus, PCI or EISA), bus
speed, floppy controller, and tape drive.  State exactly what you did,
and what happened on your system.  Some people have experienced that
<CODE>ftape</CODE> would not run in a PCI based box, but ran flawlessly in a
normal ISA based 386DX machine (see section 
<A HREF="#pci-boxes">Getting PCI motherboards to work with &lt;tt/ftape/</A> on PCI
machines above)</P>
<P>Also, please think of the poor souls who actually <EM>pay</EM> the
their Internet access (like me): avoid posting a (huge) log from the
<CODE>ftape</CODE> run, without reason.  Instead, you could describe the
problem, and offer to send the log to the interested parties.</P>
<P>Send your bug report to <CODE>&lt;linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu&gt;</CODE>. You
might also want to mail the bug to
<CODE>&lt;heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de&gt;</CODE>.</P>
