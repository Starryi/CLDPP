>The purpose of this document is to offer tips to help you through the
destruction and reinstallation of a linux system.  It's not a
foolproof cookbook by any means, but I hope it will serve as some
indication of what you need to think about, and of the order in which
to do things.  It would have been a help to me, if someone else had
written something like this before I did my first upgrade; so I hope 
it will be a help to you, if you have a linux machine to rebuild.
      </P
><P
>Don't take it as gospel, though: your mileage will almost certainly
vary.  Even the directory names in this document may be different from
the ones you need to use; some people have /usr/home instead of /home,
for example; others call it /u, and some (delicate shudder :) even put
all their users directly under /usr itself!  I can't be specific about
your system, so I've just used the names the way they are in mine.
      </P
><P
>You'll also notice that I use Slackware distributions, and that I
assume you've enough RAM and hard disk space to install linux kernel
source and build your own kernel.  If your system is different, some
of my recommendations won't apply; but I hope you'll still find the
general outline to be of assistance in your rebuild project.

>3.2. Why would anyone want to do that?</A
></H3
><P
>Good question!  If it can possibly be avoided, don't do it!  (That's
the single most important recommendation in this whole guide!!!)  When
this guide was first written, not many people had hard disks big enough
to accomodate two whole Linux installations; these days, that's by no
means uncommon.  If you possibly can, build your new system in a
separate partition (or group of partitions), keeping the old one intact
till you're satisfied that the new one is just the way you want it.  If
you can avoid destroying the old system to make room for the new, by
all means avoid it!  But there are times when you may have no choice.
      </P
><P
>(These examples are a bit dated, but they serve to illustrate my
point:)
      </P
><P
>For example, I installed a 4Gb hard disk and then found out that
Slackware 2.0 vintage linux didn't know a hard disk could have more
than 2Gb, and it got horribly confused.  So I had to upgrade to the
then-current Slackware 2.3.  That upgrade was a gruelling experience,
and it's part of the reason I'm writing these notes.  I did just about
everything wrong, and only good luck and the fact that I had another
running linux box beside me saved me from disaster.
      </P
><P
>As another example, I found that I just couldn't succeed in building a
working a.out linux kernel in the 1.3 series, using an out-of-the-box
Slackware 2.3 installation (another machine, not the one I botched
before).  I took the plunge, bought Slackware 3.0 on CDROM and
converted to ELF.  This time the reinstallation went better, thanks in
part to the previous bitter experience, and it served as the source of
most of the ideas I'm offering you here.

>3.3. Do you have to ``destroy and reinstall?''</A
></H3
><P
>See above.  If you can build your new system in otherwise empty disk
space, do it!  For the rest of this document, however, I'll assume that
this is one of those times when that option isn't available; you either
have to reinstall "in place," over top of the existing system, or you
have to bite the bullet and rebuild from scratch.
      </P
><P
>The latter is safer, oddly enough.  If you install over top of an
existing linux system, chances are you'll have a mixture of old and new
binaries, old and new configuration files, and generally a mess to try
to administer.  Wiping the system clean, and then putting back only
what you know you need, is a drastic but effective way to get a clean
result.  (Of course we're talking about installing a whole new linux
distribution here, not about upgrading one or two packages!  The best
way to avoid having to do a full reinstallation is, precisely, to keep
the individual bits -- especially gcc and its libraries, and binutils
-- current.  If the stuff you use is reasonably up-to-date, and you
can keep it so by bringing in, and if need be compiling, new code from
time to time, then there's no need for a mass upgrade.)

NAME="AEN53"
>3.4. How long will it take?</A
></H3
><P
>Depends, of course, on how complex your system is.  But I figure that,
for the successful upgrade (the other one? -- don't ask! :) I spent
about ten hours making backups, six hours rebuilding the system to the
point where I could enable logins, and another half day or thereabouts
restoring the less-crucial stuff.  As time passes I keep discovering
little things that still aren't exactly as I want them -- I fix these
as they're encountered -- but in the main, twenty hours' work should
suffice for a reasonably complex rebuilding job.  Maybe less if you're
reinstalling from hard disk (I used CDROM) or more if you need to
install from floppies.  Maybe less if you've got a fast Pentium, more
if it's a 386.  You get the idea.
      </P
><P
>Those were the bad old days.  Now, with faster disks and faster
machines and CD writers, things go better.  My notebook was stolen in
December, 2002, and when the new one came, I was up and pretty near
complete -- despite having lost the old system without the chance to
save the latest changes -- after about seven hours of effort.
      </P

decided it must be done.  Arm yourself with fortitude and Jolt or
whatever, and:

>4. Write down everything you do.</A
></H2
><P
>It's extremely valuable to have a record of what you've done in the
process of preparing for, and carrying out, the changeover.
Especially important is a list of the backups you'll be making in
preparation for the destruction of your existing system.

>5. Make a full backup of the existing system.</A
></H2
><P
>Generally speaking, big backups tend to be written on media that are
sequentially accessed.  That being so, you won't want to use this
complete backup for restoring significant numbers of files; it's got
too many files on it that you don't want.  It's better to create small
backups of individual segments that you know you're going to restore
in their entirety.  I'll list a bunch of examples later.
  </P
><P
>Why then should you start with a full backup?  Two basic reasons:
first, in the event of a catastrophic failure installing the new
system, you'll have a way to get back to the starting point with
minimum pain.  Second, no matter how carefully you prepare for the new
installation, there is a very large chance that one or two important
files will be overlooked.  In that case the clumsiness of restoring
those one or two files from the full backup set will be preferable to
the inconvenience of doing without them.
  </P
><P
>To save time and space, if you've still got the distribution medium
for your old linux version, you might want to back up only those files
the mtime or ctime of which is more recent than the date of the
original installation.

>6. Back up /etc and its subdirectories on one or more floppies.</A
></H2
><P
>This is the other extreme: you won't be restoring these files (for the
most part, anyway); you'll be comparing them with the new ones that
get created during installation.  Why?  Because the new ones may have
data that the old ones didn't, or may express the old data in new
ways.  Changes in protocols, addition of new tools, or implementation
of new features in existing tools may all dictate changes in the
formats of the configuration files and startup scripts that the /etc
tree contains, and you'll very likely have to edit your old data into
these files so as to preserve the new formats and take advantage of
the improvements.

help is to describe what I did in my system, in the hope that it will
serve as a rough guide.  Basically, you want to look at every
directory that contains any

  </P
><P
>(Another possible strategy is to back up all files with mtime or
ctime more recent than the day of the previous linux installation,
as mentioned above, and then restore from that.  If you do that,
you have to take into account that the new linux distribution may
contain versions of some files that are newer still than the ones
you saved.)

do that with; for example, /etc/XF86Config (as long as you're using
the same version of XFree86 -- and the same video hardware -- in the
new installation as you did in the old).  For the most part, though,
it's best to use diff to compare the old and new files before doing
any copying.  Watch out especially for significant changes in the
files in /etc/rc.d and friends, which may require you to reestablish
your old configuration by hand editing, instead of by copying the old
rc scripts from your backup.  Once it's all done, reboot.

that supports your hardware, it's worth doing it in order to get a
kernel that doesn't contain masses of drivers for stuff your machine
doesn't have -- and even more so, in order to get a good understanding
of how your kernel configuration options affect the behaviour of your
system!  As linux grows, the ability of the distribution vendors to
configure a one-size-fits-all kernel has become very limited.  For
details on how it's done, see the Kernel HOWTO; it looks complicated at
first, but it's not rocket science; just take it a step at a time.

was newer than the one on the Slackware installation and I hadn't
bothered to save the binary from /sbin.  You'll want to check through
your restored programs and confirm the existence and correctness of
configuration files, libraries and so on.  In some cases, you may have
to restore things in a specific order; you did make notes during
backup, didn't you? ;-)

></H2
><P
>(Sigh...) When I wrote this, this step was important but not crucial;
the Internet was a friendlier place even in 1996 than it is today. 
Now, if your machine has Internet access, this step is utterly vital,
and there are whole books devoted to getting it right; I can do nothing
more here than offer a few very basic pointers:
  </P
><P
>Check file permissions and directory permissions to be sure that
access is neither too restricted nor too easy.  I find that Slackware
tends to lean toward a more open environment than I like, so I go
around changing 755's to 711's for binaries in the .../bin directories
and stuff like that.  Or even 700's in the .../sbin ones.  Especial
care is needed if you've carried over ftp, telnet or web servers; but
then, if you were running those, you probably thought of that already. :)
  </P
><P
>Look at /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.conf and make sure you're not
running any Internet services you don't need to.  Also go through the
boot scripts in /etc/rc.d and friends for the same purpose.  Check your
firewall rules if your box is an Internet gateway or has Internet
access.
