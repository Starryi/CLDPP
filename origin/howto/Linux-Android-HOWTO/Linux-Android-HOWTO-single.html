<H1>Linux and Android HOWTO</H1>

<H2>Guido Gonzato, Ph.D. <CODE>guido.gonzato at gmail.com</CODE></H2>March 2016, version 1.0.0
<HR>
<EM>  This HOWTO provides information on how to manage your Android device
  using a GNU/Linux system. It's aimed at reasonably competent Linux
  users who want more control over their Android device.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>I started this document at the end of 2014, over 15 years after my
previous HOWTOs. In the meantime, GNU/Linux on the desktop has
basically failed, but a GNU-less Linux variant has gained a large
market share in the mobile industry. It's Android: a partially open
platform, based on the Linux kernel and a mix of open and closed
programs (``apps''). As a matter of fact, Android is by far the most
widespread Linux distribution, even though most of its users don't
even know they're using Linux!</P>

<P>(A pocket-size Unix system that one can get for less than 100 bucks.
Amazing! If they'd told me about it in the early '90s, I would have
dismissed it as cheap science fiction.)</P>

<P>I purchased an Android phone and a mid-spec Android tablet, and I
wondered if I could do something interesting with them --- apart from
making phone calls and browsing the net, that is. Android is meant to
be very easy to use, and no trickery is required for normal use. The
thing is, I'm not a normal user: I'm a GNU/Linux sysadmin, and just
scratching the surface is not enough for me. So I started
experimenting and gathering information.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Purpose of this guide</A>
</H2>

<P>This guide is meant to be a quick reference for GNU/Linux users who
want to use their Android device in less-than-trivial ways, and want
their Linux and Android boxes to talk to each other. Most vendors
provide drivers and ancillary programs for Microsoft Windows or Apple
OS X only, but a GNU/Linux system is perfectly capable of interacting
with Android devices. With a bit of hacking, as usual.</P>

<P>In the following, I will share a few tricks I have collected:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> using the Android Debug Bridge;</LI>
<LI> understanding and using the Android file system;</LI>
<LI> installing programs from other markets;</LI>
<LI> copying and syncing files and directories;</LI>
<LI> backing up stuff;</LI>
<LI> using a terminal emulator;</LI>
<LI> compiling native command-line programs;</LI>
<LI> remote control to/from Android;</LI>
<LI> and more.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>I work on a GNU/Linux Mint box, but I'll try and be
distribution-agnostic. I'll concentrate on Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) whenever possible, and I'll take standard, unrooted
Android devices into account. By the way: ``rooting'' means tweaking
your Andbox to gain root permissions, as you would do in Linux with
<CODE>sudo</CODE>. ``Unrooted'' means ``not tweaked''.</P>

<P>Since Android is very fragmented (hey, it's Linux after all!) and
several versions are available, I'll just provide information that is
applicable to what I own: Android 4.0.4, 4.1.1, and 5.0.1 on ARM
architecture. All examples and code in this HOWTO were actually tested
on my devices; hopefully, they should work on your device too. If you
want me to cover more Android versions, I'll be glad to receive new
equipment; or just tips. Equipment is preferred :-)</P>

<P>Currently, the majority of Android devices are ARM based; others are
based on x86 or MIPS CPUs, in both 32 and 64 bit flavours. This is not
a significant difference: most applications are written in Java with
no native code, so they are CPU-agnostic. Instructions in this HOWTO
should work for these Android versions, too. I guess that relevant
differences concern security policies.</P>

<P>Should you have trouble with your Android device, I suggest that you
refer to Android forums. Among the many available, I find the
following especially helpful:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">http://forum.xda-developers.com/</A>
</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://forums.androidcentral.com/">http://forums.androidcentral.com/</A>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Besides: if you find any errors in this guide, please report them to
me.</P>

<P>Thoughout this HOWTO, all instances of ``Linux'' actually mean
``GNU/Linux''. The GNU part is very important, and I'm very grateful
to GNU for its fantastic programs. ``Andbox'' will stand for ``Android
device''.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>I shall assume that you are a reasonably competent Linux user: you
must be able to open a terminal, issue commands, become root, edit
files, compile and install software. No spoon-feeding here.</P>

<P>As far as Android expertise is concerned, only the very basics are
required. You are expected to be able to perform common tasks such as
installing software, enabling USB debugging, using Bluetooth, and so
on. Nothing special, really: in general, you'll have to be able to
find out where options are in your device. I would be glad to provide
information, but unfortunately no identical menus or screens can be
found across different devices of different brands and different
Android releases. You will have to figure it out yourself.</P>

<P>Finally: rooting your device might be desirable, but it's not
necessary as far as this HOWTO is concerned. Root permissions are
normally forbidden in Android, unless an enlightened vendor decides
otherwise. I will mention a great program that needs root access
(Webkey), but the rest of recommended software will not need it. By
the way: in the following, I'll use the appropriate term ``program''
or ``application'', not the marketing term ``app''. (Yep, I'm an old
and grumpy guy.)</P>



<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The basics</A></H2>

<P>To begin our journey, you will have to install some essential
programs. Please note that Linux-side programs might be available as
native packages for your distribution, i.e. as <CODE>.rpm</CODE> or
<CODE>.deb</CODE> archives.</P>

<P>The very first thing you should do is enable USB debugging; this
feature is found under ``Settings'', ``Developer options''. If your
device lacks this entry (shame on the vendor!), you can enable
developer options by tapping 7 times --- I'm not kidding! --- on the
``Build version'' menu.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Linux ADB (Android Debug Bridge)</A>
</H2>

<P>ADB is a command line tool, installable on your Linux box. It lets you
communicate with an Andbox, usually connected via USB, in order to
perform a wide range of operations.</P>

<P>If you're lucky, your distribution may include a package called
<CODE>android-tools-adb</CODE>, which contains the <CODE>adb</CODE> command.
If not, get the Android SDK Tools for Linux from:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://developer.android.com/sdk/">http://developer.android.com/sdk/</A></P>

<P>and find out how to install it on your Linux box.</P>

<P>I suggest that you open a terminal and run <CODE>adb</CODE> with no
options to get an information screen. You should become familiar at
least with the following options:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>adb devices</CODE>: list connected devices</LI>
<LI> <CODE>adb push</CODE>: copy file/dir from Linux to device</LI>
<LI> <CODE>adb pull</CODE>: copy file/dir from device to Linux</LI>
<LI> <CODE>adb shell</CODE>: open command-line shell on the device</LI>
<LI> <CODE>adb install</CODE>: install a <CODE>.apk</CODE> on the device</LI>
<LI> <CODE>adb backup</CODE>: perform device backup</LI>
<LI> <CODE>adb restore</CODE>: perform device restore
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Before using the <CODE>adb</CODE> commands, you must make your Andbox
visible to the Linux box. Enable USB debugging on your device and
connect it via USB cable to your Linux host; the Andbox will probably
make a sound and/or flash the screen and/or ask for your permission.
Issue this command:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ adb devices
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
245a16e41fe71a95427cc4e65d36cc9f        device
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>If you don't see any output after ``List of devices attached'', or if
a row of `<CODE>?</CODE>' is displayed, some steps and some patience are
required to make your device visible. First of all, find out your
device's Vendor ID and Product ID:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ lsusb
...
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1e68:0072 TrekStor GmbH &amp; Co. KG 
...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>In this example, <CODE>1e68</CODE> is my tablet's Vendor ID, while
<CODE>0072</CODE> is the Product ID. </P>

<P>I assume that your Linux distribution uses <CODE>udev</CODE>. As root,
edit the file:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/etc/udev/rules.d/50-android.rules
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>(create a new file if it's missing) and add this line:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="1e68", MODE="0666"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Change your Vendor ID and username as necessary, save the file and
restart udev:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ sudo udevadm control --reload
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Some devices may also need this additional step:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ mkdir $HOME/.android
echo "0X1E68" >> $HOME/.android/adb_usb.ini
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>that is, <CODE>0X</CODE> (zero-ex) followed by your Vendor ID, all
uppercase. Now unplug the USB cable, plug it in again, and run the
commands:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ adb kill-server
Linux:~$ adb devices
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
245a16e41fe71a95427cc4e65d36cc9f        device
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Now your Andbox should be visibile. If it's still not recognised, try
all the above as root. If it still doesn't work, there might be a
problem with your Andbox; you should consult your device's vendor.</P>

<P>If you have more than one device, you might have to restart the
<CODE>adb</CODE> service to make the new Andbox visible when you plug it:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ adb devices

</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 The Android file system</A>
</H2>

<P>Now we can talk to the Andbox via <CODE>adb</CODE>, so let's have a look
at the Android file system hierarchy. I assume that you're familiar
with the standard Linux directory hieararchy; Android's is fairly
similar, with a couple of important differences.</P>

<P>Connect your Andbox and run the <CODE>adb shell</CODE> command, which
launches Android's internal shell. Please be aware that Android's
native shell is much less sophisticated than <CODE>bash</CODE>; available
commands are not made by GNU either, so you should expect minor
differences.</P>

<P>Minor differences are possible; for example, in the above screenshot I
omitted a directory that is apparently tied to a specific vendor. Note
that all directories except three belong to <CODE>root:root</CODE>; as a
consequence, access to their contents will be limited on unrooted

</P>

<P>Note the similarities and the differences with Linux filesystems; it
looks a lot like standard Unix, anyway.</P>

<P>What you can actually do with the file system layout is <EM>much</EM>
less than you would with Linux. On standard, unrooted devices, you can
only access the internal storage, usually mounted on
<CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE>, and the external storage (if available), usually
mounted on <CODE>/mnt/external_sd</CODE>. The actual names of these
directories may vary; e.g. <CODE>/storage/sdcard0</CODE> or something
else. You'll probably have to figure it out for each device.</P>

<P>User data, programs included, are stored in <CODE>/data</CODE>. Using the
Android shell you can <CODE>cd</CODE> to that directory, but you can't
list its contents if you lack root permissions. Programs are usually
stored in <CODE>/data/app</CODE>, but others (typically, paid programs and
programs moved to the external storage) under <CODE>/mnt/asec</CODE>.</P>

<P>A very important directory under <CODE>/data</CODE> is accessible and
writeable: <CODE>/data/local/tmp</CODE>. We'll make use of this directory
later.</P>

<P>Note that internal and external storage is mounted as VFAT, the
beloved file system that lacks file permissions and many more
features. We will see in the following how to circumvent VFAT
limitations.</P>


<H2><A NAME="maindir"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Main directories in the internal storage </A>
</H2>

<P>Assuming that <CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE> is the directory containing the
internal storage, you should become familiar with the following
sub-directories. Remember that <CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE> is mounted as
VFAT; directory names are therefore case-insensitive.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Android/data/</CODE> contains directories with
programs' user data. Each directory is named after the application,
using a naming convention that will be explained in Section 
<A HREF="#programs">Installing/Uninstalling Programs from Linux</A>.
For example, Firefox settings are stored in
<CODE>org.mozilla.firefox/</CODE>.
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>Download/</CODE> may contain files downloaded by browsers,
unless they're configured otherwise.
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>DCIM/</CODE> contains one or more directories, each of which
contains photographs stored as <CODE>.jpg</CODE> files. In my phone,
<CODE>DCIM/</CODE> contains two directories, <CODE>Camera</CODE> and
<CODE>OpenCamera</CODE>. Each directory contains pictures taken with a
specific camera program: the default (Camera) and an additional
program I installed (OpenCamera).
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>LOST.DIR/</CODE> may contain files that were recovered at
boot time, when Android performs a file system check.
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>Notifications/</CODE> contains sound files for notifications
(SMS, etc.). You can add your favourite sound files there.
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>Ringtones/</CODE>, similarly, contains sound files used as
ring tones. You can add your favourite sound files there.
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>System/</CODE> may contain system data; in my phone,
contacts backups are saved in <CODE>System/PIM/</CODE>.
  </LI>
<LI><CODE>Bluetooth/</CODE> contains file transfered via Bluetooth.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>In addition, some applications make their data directory under
<CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE> directly; for example,
<CODE>/mnt/sdcard/Foo123</CODE>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Applications</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Alternative markets</A>
</H2>

<P>In case you don't know: Android applications are distributed as
<CODE>.apk</CODE> (Android application package) files, which are simple
zip-compressed archives. Apk is the standard Android package format,
and it serves the same purpose as <CODE>.rpm</CODE> or <CODE>.deb</CODE>
archives in Linux distributions.  As you probably know, programs are
not downloaded as <CODE>.apk</CODE>s from Google Play; they're pushed to
your device.</P>

<P>If you don't want to use the Google Play repository, or if you can't,
there are alternative markets that provide Android FOSS:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>F-Droid, 
  
<P>
<A HREF="https://f-droid.org">https://f-droid.org/</A></P>

<P>lets you download programs <CODE>.apk</CODE>s directly, or via its
client called <CODE>FDroid.apk</CODE>. I strongly suggest that you
install the latter, that (from the F-Droid page) ``makes it easy to
browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.''</P>

</LI>
<LI>AOpenSource.com,
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.aopensource.com">http://www.aopensource.com</A></P>

<P>is another repository dedicated to FOSS. In many cases, it simply
redirects to Google Play; in other cases, to the application's home
page.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>In fact, many Android programs have their own web page, from which you
can download the <CODE>.apk</CODE> and, in some cases, the program
sources, documentation and so on.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Useful tools</A>
</H2>

<P>Advanced Android users will want to install a file manager and a
decent keyboard. Several FOSS programs are available, and my
suggestions are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hacker's Keyboard:
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/">http://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/</A></P>

<P>is a ``real'' keyboard that provides arrow keys, Esc, Alt, Ctrl, and
so on; you really can't do without it if you plan to use a terminal
emulator. Released under the Apache License 2.0. </P>

</LI>
<LI>Ghost Commander:
  
<P>
<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/site/ghostcommander1">https://sites.google.com/site/ghostcommander1</A></P>

<P>is a very powerful, easy to use and complete dual-pane file manager,
released under the GPL3. In addition to the usual features, it also
provides plugins for accessing files via SMB, SFTP, GoogleDrive,
DropBox, and BOX.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>There are many other free file managers, but I feel that Ghost
Commander is the most complete. Of course, feel free to install
another if you prefer.</P>

<P>In addition to the tools above, you may want to turn your Andbox into
something similar to a real Linux machine. You really want a terminal
emulator and BusyBox, 
<A HREF="http://www.busybox.net/">http://www.busybox.net/</A>. The latter is a single executable
that provides the functionality of several commands that you normally
expect to find in any self-respecting Unix box, but that are missing
in Android. <CODE>cp</CODE> and <CODE>tar</CODE> are the first that spring to
mind.</P>

<P>In Section 
<A HREF="#terminals">Terminal Emulators and Shells</A>
some terminal emulators will be briefly described; they also include
BusyBox. The terminal emulator will let you run countless command-line
programs that you can port to Android yourself!</P>


<H2><A NAME="programs"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Installing/uninstalling programs from Linux </A>
</H2>

<P>You may find it convenient to download and store <CODE>.apk</CODE>s in
your Linux machine, possibly to install them on several Andboxes.</P>

<P>Let's suppose you downloaded an application, <CODE>foo123.apk</CODE>, and
want to install it in your Andboxes. The simplest solution is to use
the <CODE>adb install</CODE> command:</P>
<P>

<P>You might be surprised to find out that an application's real name
<EM>does not correspond</EM> to the name of its <CODE>apk</CODE>! For
example, the real name of <CODE>foo123</CODE> could be something similar
to <CODE>com.android.foo123</CODE>. This naming method is based on
Java package conventions, which are described at this page:</P>

<P>You must know a program's real name if you want to uninstall it using

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Installing APKs via another Andbox</A>

<P>An Andbox can easily share its installed programs with another
device, provided that the Android versions are compatible. All you
need is Ghost Commander. In the next paragraph, you can see how to
send a file to Alice using Bob's Andbox.</P>

<P>From the ``Home'' position, select ``Applications'' to get a list of
installed <CODE>.apk</CODE>s ; click on the one you want and copy it to a
standard folder (say, <CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE>.) From this location, long
press on the program <CODE>.apk</CODE> and select ``Send To...''. Now
select Bluetooth, which is probably the easiest way to send the APK to
Alice; or choose another method from Section 
<A HREF="#copying">Copying Files</A> below. If your device refuses to send a
<CODE>.apk</CODE> file via Bluetooth, just rename or zip it before sending
it, then unpack it or rename it back on the new device.</P>

<P>From within the Ghost Commander, tap on the <CODE>.apk</CODE> file to
install the program. When done, you can delete the <CODE>.apk</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="copying"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Copying files </A></H2>

<P>Exchanging files between Linux and Android should be trivial, right?
Well, it's not. There are several ways to copy files from/to your
Andbox, using a cable or Wi-Fi.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Copying via USB cable (from Linux box)</A>
</H2>

<P>When you connect your device via USB cable, Linux may see it either as
an external USB drive or as an <EM>MTP device</EM>, i.e. a multimedia
player. In the first case, <CODE>udev</CODE> mounts the device somewhere,
like <CODE>/media/guido/DEVICE</CODE>. Exchanging files is now trivial:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux~$ rsync -av --delete -i ~/Documents/MyStuff/ /media/guido/DEVICE/MyStuff/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>If the Andbox is connected via MTP, more trickery might be required.
Some Linux versions will mount the device using <CODE>gfsd-fuse</CODE>;
for instance, my phone's internal storage is accessible at this
directory:</P>

<P><CODE>/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C111%5D/Internal Storage</CODE></P>

<P>You may want to make a directory like the above more accessible
creating a symbolic link, but unfortunately this directory is only
temporary. In fact, the next time you plug your Andbox, the string
<CODE>mtp:host</CODE> is bound to change.</P>

<P>You will immediately notice that accessing the Andbox file system is
quite slow.</P>

<P>In other cases, nothing happens. To access files on the device, you'll
have to use programs that deal with MTP:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Libmtp, 
<A HREF="http://libmtp.sourceforge.net/">http://libmtp.sourceforge.net/</A>
  
<P>Provides MTP Tools, i.e. command line utilities to manage files,
albums, playlists etc. on the device.</P>

</LI>
<LI> Gmtp, 
<A HREF="http://gmtp.sourceforge.net/">http://gmtp.sourceforge.net/</A>
  
<P>A graphical program to perform the same actions as MTP Tools.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>In my personal experience, copying files with MTP has proven to be
unreliable and error-prone. Copying files is also possible via ADB
commands, which appear to be quite reliable. The following two
commands copy (push) a file from Linux to the Andbox, and the other
way around (pull):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ adb push file.txt /mnt/sdcard/directory/
Linux:~$ adb pull /mnt/sdcard/directory/file.txt

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>In the latter example, please note you must not add a dot at the end
of the command: it's not the same as the Linux command <CODE>cp
/mnt/sdcard/file.txt .</CODE></P>

come in handy.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Backing up applications</A>

<P>Installed applications are stored in <CODE>/data/apps/</CODE>, which is
inaccessible on unrooted devices. You can, however, backup your

command. I prefer the former, which is way faster and more convenient
(IMHO).</P>

<P>Start Ghost Commander and select a directory on the internal storage;
for example, <CODE>/mnt/sdcard/Tmp</CODE>. Move to the other pane, select
``Home'', then ``Applications''. Select the applications you want to
backup, the select ``Copy''. Please note that all applications will be
listed, including system applications.</P>

<P>To copy the selected <CODE>.apk</CODE> to your Linux box, all you have to

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Backing up applications data</A>
</H2>

<P>As explained in Section 
<A HREF="#maindir">Main Directories in the Internal Storage</A>, applications data is stored in directories

information you need to back up these directories!</P>


<H2><A NAME="terminals"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Terminal emulator and shells </A></H2>

<P>If you're a geek, you'll want to use a command line interface on your
Andbox. Properly configured, a terminal emulator will give you
almost the same interface as the Linux terminal. This is especially
useful if your Andbox has a physical keyboard.</P>

<P>If you're not a geek, you should install a terminal emulator
nonetheless: it will be useful anyway, since you'll be able to use
some important command-line commands like Busybox. More about this
later.</P>

<P>One of the best FOSS options is Android Terminal Emulator, available
here:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/wiki">https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/wiki</A></P>

<P>It provides a fully functional terminal emulator, which is invaluable
for at least two reasons. First and foremost, you will be able to run
most command-line programs available on Linux; in many cases, you can
even compile them yourself. Secondly, the terminal makes the standard
Android commands found in <CODE>/system/bin</CODE> and
<CODE>/system/xbin</CODE> available to you. But <EM>beware</EM>: these are
not the same as the standard Linux commands! They're only a subset of
the standard GNU commands (even <CODE>cp</CODE> is missing: use <CODE>cat
file > newfile</CODE> instead), and they usually don't behave exactly
the same.</P>

<P>If you need a more complete command-line experience, you will also
want to install a command-line environment like KBOX, ZShaolin,
Terminal IDE, or Termux:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>KBOX3 (KBOX2 is an older version):
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://kevinboone.net/kbox3.html">http://kevinboone.net/kbox3.html</A></P>

<P>KBOX is a compact and fully functional Linux-like command-line
environment. It also provides additional software, such as
<CODE>gcc</CODE>, <CODE>tmux</CODE>, the <CODE>dropbear</CODE> SSH server, and
much more.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Zshaolin:
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.dyne.org/software/zshaolin/">http://www.dyne.org/software/zshaolin/</A></P>

<P>Zshaolin is a <CODE>zsh</CODE>-based terminal that provides lots (I mean
<EM>lots</EM>) of additional free software. The whole thing is FOSS,
but is not cost-free.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Terminal IDE:
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.spartacusrex.com/terminalide.htm">http://www.spartacusrex.com/terminalide.htm</A></P>

<P>It's a very complete Linux-like command-line environment. It's
focused on development, providing Vim, <CODE>gcc</CODE>, <CODE>mc</CODE>,
<CODE>ssh</CODE>, and loads of software. Once installed, it gives you
the option ``Install System'' to install additional components,
including the <CODE>bash</CODE> shell.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>All of them are great programs: advanced users really can't do without
a terminal.</P>

<P>Which one to install depends on how much sdcard space you can afford.
If you have a few hundreds of MBytes to devote to it, I would suggest
that you install Terminal IDE: it provides a very Linux-like
experience. If you're short on storage, I suggest that you install
KBOX: it's a very good compromise.</P>
<P>Users of Android 5 and later versions may want to install an
alternative terminal emulator called Termux:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="https://termux.com/">https://termux.com/</A></P>

<P>It's very nice and self-contained, i.e. it does not need KBOX or
another command-line environment. Additional software can be installed
simply using apt (Debian users, does that ring a bell?):</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Installing KBOX</A>

``guest''. Ask your local sysadmin (and buy him/her a beer while

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Compiling C programs, Linux side</A>
</H2>

<P>Once you have a terminal emulator, you can add a lot of command-line
based software to your Android box. If you're a geek, this is an
invaluable extension that makes your Andbox closer to a ``real''
computer; but even if you're a casual user, please read on.</P>

<P>You can compile C programs directly on your Andbox, and also on your
Linux box. In the latter case, you use a so-called <EM>cross compiler
toolchain</EM>: a compiler and associated binutils that produce code
for Android. In many cases, but not only, for the ARM cpu.</P>

<P>Most Linux distributions provide one or more cross compiler toolchains
that target ARM on Android. On my box, I installed the package
<CODE>gcc-arm-linux-androideabi</CODE> and its dependencies. If your Linux
distributions doesn't include it by default, get the relevant
toolchain from the NDK home page:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html">http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html</A></P>

<P>Another toolchain that targets Android on x86 CPUs is called
<CODE>gcc-i686-linux-android</CODE>.</P>

<P>Choose the relevant architecture and download the binary package for
Linux 32-bit or 64-bit. The directory</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86/bin/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>contains prebuilt binaries: include that directory in the
<CODE>$PATH</CODE>. MIPS and x86 binaries are also available.</P>

<P>Supposing you're compiling for ARM, the compiler is called
<CODE>arm-linux-androideabi-gcc</CODE>. You use it instead of <CODE>gcc</CODE>
to compile Android binaries. In general, all binutils have a
<CODE>arm-linux-androideabi-</CODE> prefix.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ arm-linux-androideabi-gcc -static -o hello hello.c
Linux:~$ arm-linux-androideabi-strip hello
Linux:~$ file hello
hello: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
Linux:~$ _
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>The <CODE>-static</CODE> option makes the executable self-contained. It
may be necessary to avoid problems with shared libraries, but it also
makes the executable larger.</P>

<P>Now you can copy the program to your Android box, but you can't copy
it to any directory of your choice. In fact, if you copy a program to
a directory in the internal memory, like <CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE>, you'll
be unable to run the program as it lacks the 755 permissions.
Remember, <CODE>/mnt/sdcard</CODE> is mounted as VFAT, so it cannot provide
file permissions.</P>

<P>Fortunately, the Android file system has a directory that is writeable
and supports file permissions: <CODE>/data/local/tmp</CODE>. Unlike the
<CODE>/tmp</CODE> directory in Linux, files in this directory are not
deleted at boot time.</P>

<P>Here is how to copy (all Android versions) and run (Android older than
5.*) your application on the Andbox:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ adb push hello /data/local/tmp
57 KB/s (2752 bytes in 0.046s)
geo:~$ adb shell
shell@android:/ $ cd /data/local/tmp
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ chmod 755 hello
shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ ./hello
Hello, world!
32|shell@android:/data/local/tmp $ exit
Linux:~$ _
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Beware: Android 5.* has better security policies and will not allow
running programs from <CODE>/data/local/tmp</CODE>, or even accessing that
directory. From the terminal, you'll have to copy the compiled
programs to a directory where you have write and execute permissions.
Beware: you will have to copy files in the blind, specifying their
exact names, no wildcards allowed!</P>

<P>For instance, using KBOX:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kbox$ ls /android_root/data/local/tmp
ls: cannot open directory  /android_root/data/local/tmp: permission denied
kbox$ cp /android_root/data/local/tmp/hello .
kbox$ ls
hello
kbox$ chmod 755 hello
kbox$ ./hello
hello, world!

<P>A remarkable list of command-line programs can be easily compiled for
Android. Among others, I ported the Bywater BASIC interpreter:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/</A></P>

<P>(minor tweaks were needed: I added <CODE>-DHAVE_ISNAN=1</CODE> to the DEFS
in the <CODE>Makefile</CODE>, and also <CODE>#define uint64_t unsigned
long</CODE> at the top of <CODE>bwbasic.h</CODE>)</P>

<P>The C version of the e3 text editor (version 2.7.1) can be compiled
with no tweaks at all:</P>

<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/site/e3editor/">https://sites.google.com/site/e3editor/</A></P>

<P>same for the ABC music tools:</P>

<A HREF="http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/">http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/</A></P>

<P>In general, any program that doesn't depend on fancy libraries is
readily portable to Android. Explanations on compiling stuff in
Android are available here:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://kevinboone.net/android_native.html">http://kevinboone.net/android_native.html</A>.</P>

<P>Compile the programs you need, copy them to <CODE>/data/local/tmp/</CODE>,
and make sure this directory is included in the <CODE>$PATH</CODE> of your
favourite terminal.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Compiling C programs, Android side</A>
</H2>

<P>The simplest way to compile programs on an Android box is installing
Terminal IDE, cited above, and its ``System'' that includes the
<CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler. It's included, but as a compressed archive:
it's up to the user to unpack it and install it. Let's see how to do it.</P>

<P>Start Terminal IDE, enter the terminal and insert these commands:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd system
tar zxvf android-gcc-4.4.0.tar.gz
cd
vi .bashrc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Surely you can use <CODE>vi</CODE>, can't you? Move to the end of the file
and add this line:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
export PATH=$HOME/system/android-gcc-4.4.0/arm-eabi/bin:$PATH
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>save, exit <CODE>vi</CODE>, exit Terminal IDE then restart it. You have
expanded the PATH to include the directory containing the <CODE>gcc</CODE>
executable. Now you should be able to run it:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
gcc
gcc: no input files
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>That's it! From now on, you can compile programs directly on your
Android box. Don't expect to be able to compile every single, though.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 CCTools</A>
</H2>

<P>As the CCTools home page states, ``CCTools is native IDE for Android
devices. It includes C/C++/Lua/GNU Makefile/Shell source code editor
with syntax highlighting and complete android gcc toolchain for
arm/mips/x86 devices.''</P>

<P>CCTools is a very nice addition, and it also provides support for
Fortran, SDL and much more. I suggest that you give it a try.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Remote control</A></H2>

<P>An Andbox can be turned into a remote that works via WiFi, Bluetooth,
or USB, to control a PC or other devices. Conversely, a PC can be used
to remotely control your Andbox.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Web interface to android</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several free-as-in-free-beer programs that provide a Web
interface to Wi-Fi connected Andbox: AirDroid, 3CX
DroidDesktop, RemoteDesktop, and many others. These programs let you
access your device and manage files, SMS, multimedia, and more. Great
programs, really: too bad they're not FOSS.</P>

<P>As of this writing, the only FOSS program that provides the same
functionality (and much more) is Webkey, released under the GPL:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/webkey-dev/downloads/list">https://code.google.com/p/webkey-dev/downloads/list</A></P>

<P>It lets you fully control your device via WiFi or 3/4G using a
browser. Unfortunately, it requires root: but it's such an incredibly
great program, you may want to root your device just to use it.</P>

<P>Enable Wi-Fi, start Webkey and take note of the https address. Open a
browser on the Linux box and go the https address to be greeted by
Webkey's login page. Click on ``Registration'', insert a username and
password and click on ``Create new user''. Webkey will ask for your
permission to allow the user to control the phone. Using the newly
created credentials, you can now log in.</P>

<P>Now, put the Andbox down and navigate through available options.
Everything you can do on the Andbox can be done in Webkey's page: it
provides a terminal, file manager, screenshot, program control, and
<EM>much</EM> more!</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Android as a remote</A>
</H2>

<P>Many commercial and/or free-as-in-free-beer applications exist;
just search the web to find them. FOSS applications worth mentioning
are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Gfx Tablet (MIT License): it turns the Andbox into a

</P>

<P>They all work in a similar manner. First off, you install a ``server''
program on the Linux box, then use the Android application that
talks to it. Let's see, for instance, how to install RemoteDroid.</P>

<P>Copy the server <CODE>RemoteDroidServer.jar</CODE> somewhere to your Linux
box, then run it:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ java -jar RemoteDroidServer.jar
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>A window will pop up, showing some information and the IP address you
can connect to. Activate WiFi on the Andbox (3G/4G/xG is not
supported), launch RemoteDroid, and provide the IP address you were
shown. There you are: slide your finger on the Android screen and see
the arrow move on the Linux box.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 X servers</A>
</H2>

<P>If you're a geek, you know that you can run a program on a remote
computer and display its graphical user interface on another computer.
This useful feature is provided by the X server; most Linux
distributions use X.Org.</P>

<P>At least two Android X server implementations are available:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>android-xserver: 
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/android-xserver/">http://code.google.com/p/android-xserver/</A>
  </LI>

  </LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>I encountered a few issues using <CODE>android-xserver</CODE>, while XSDL
gave me no problems. XSDL is pretty self-explanatory: when you first
start it, it asks for your permission to download and install
additional fonts. Then, it gives you instructions on how to start a
window manager and an application on the remote Linux (or Unix)
machine.</P>

<P>Start XSDL, then start Terminal IDE and run these commands:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

Linux:~$ marco &amp; # window manager
Linux:~$ gimp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>At this stage, you'll have the Gimp running on the remote machine and
displaying its user interface on the Andbox. Now you can enjoy
the awkward experience of using a graphical application without a
physical mouse!</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 VNC client</A>
</H2>

<P>Using a VNC client you can control a remote graphical session from
your Andbox. Several VNC clients exist; a GPL'ed one is
androidVNC,</P>

<P>
<A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-viewer/">https://code.google.com/p/android-vnc-viewer/</A></P>

<P>also available from F-Droid.</P>

<P>You will also need a VNC server on the Linux remote machine. There are
many VNC servers available; in the following example I'll use Tight
VNC, GPL'ed,</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.tightvnc.com/">http://www.tightvnc.com</A></P>

<P>The first command you must provide on the Linux box is
<CODE>tightvncpasswd</CODE>, which lets you set an access password for VNC
sessions (user name is not required). Once you've set your password,
start the server:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>

<P>The server is started, most probably on TCP port 5901 (check the log
file). A new file, <CODE>$HOME/.vnc/xstartup</CODE>, has been created:
you're free to modify it to customize your VNC session.</P>

<P>Now, run androidVNC and provide the connection information. Colour
depth will influence your connection speed; the fewer colours, the
faster the connection. Again, enjoy the awkward world of mouse-less
user interface!</P>


<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Taking screenshots and screencasts</A></H2>

<P>Some Android versions let the user take a screenshot natively,
usually holding the Power and Volume Down buttons together. For all
others, there's DroidAtScreen:</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://droid-at-screen.ribomation.com/">http://droid-at-screen.ribomation.com/</A></P>

<P>This application is invaluable if you want to display your Android
screen on a computer and/or a projector.</P>

<P>On the Andbox, all you have to do is enable USB debug.
DroidAtScreen is a Java application that runs on the Linux box, where
it needs <CODE>adb</CODE>. Extract the .jar file and run it:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Linux:~$ java -jar droidAtScreen-1.0.2.jar &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Then configure DroidAtScreen telling it where to find the adb
executable; type in its full path. You may have to click on Restart
ADB and/or Reload Devices.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Sharing GPS via Bluetooth</A></H2>

<P>One of the most useful features of many Andboxs is the
integrated GPS circuitry. GPS-enabled Android phones can share the
location with other devices, including Android and Linux machines. All
you need is Bluetooth and some software.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Sharing from Android to Android</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's suppose that you have a GPS-enabled Android phone and a GPS-less
Android tablet. On the phone, you can install a program that turns it
into an NMEA GPS---that is, a GPS receiver that can ``talk'' to other
devices using the NMEA protocol. On the tablet, you will install a
program that connects to the NMEA GPS and reads the location info.</P>

<P>Bluetooth GPS for Android,</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluegps4droid/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluegps4droid/</A></P>

<P>is the program you need to connect to the NMEA GPS. In our example,
you will install it on the tablet.</P>

<P>On the phone, you have more choice. I tested the following NMEA
programs, all of which worked well:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>GPS over BT:

unknown license.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Share GPS:

</LI>
<LI>GPS 2 Bluetooth:
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://android.cajax.net/">http://android.cajax.net/</A></P>

<P>This program is extremely simple to use: it's basically an on/off
button to enable the external GPS. Free to use, unknown licence.</P>

</LI>
<LI> BlueNMEA:
  
<P>
<A HREF="http://max.kellermann.name/projects/blue-nmea/">http://max.kellermann.name/projects/blue-nmea/</A></P>

<P>It's a tiny, very basic program. It's free to use, sources
available, unknown licence.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Once you have the software installed on the devices, you're ready to
go. First of all, enable GPS on the phone and get the fix. Then,
enable bluetooth on both devices and pair them. Then start the NMEA
app of your choice on the phone.</P>

<P>To get the GPS location on the tablet, start Bluetooth GPS for
Android. The location will become available in a few seconds, and will
be shown in applications. My favourite is Osmand,

<H2><A NAME="s10">10. The end, for now</A></H2>

<P>Congratulations! You have now some basic information on how to turn
your Andbox into something even more useful, and how to interact with it using
your trusted GNU/Linux machine. </P>

<P>At the end of this document, I can confess you the truth: while I'm a
long-term GNU/Linux fan, I'm afraid I've just started to appreciate
Android. I find it insanely fragmented; until recently, it was
unacceptably sluggish and laggy; I also believe it still suffers from
(at least) a couple of serious design flaws. Besides, I don't like
tablets, all of them; I find way too limited, if compared to a real
computer. That said, I can say that my 8-core, Android 5.0.1-based
phone is quite nice.</P>

<P>I hope this guide provided some useful information. It's only the
