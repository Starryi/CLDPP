<P>I started this document at the end of 2014, over 15 years after my
previous HOWTOs. In the meantime, GNU/Linux on the desktop has
basically failed, but a GNU-less Linux variant has gained a large
market share in the mobile industry. It's Android: a partially open
platform, based on the Linux kernel and a mix of open and closed
programs (``apps''). As a matter of fact, Android is by far the most
widespread Linux distribution, even though most of its users don't
even know they're using Linux!</P>

<P>(A pocket-size Unix system that one can get for less than 100 bucks.
Amazing! If they'd told me about it in the early '90s, I would have
dismissed it as cheap science fiction.)</P>

<P>I purchased an Android phone and a mid-spec Android tablet, and I
wondered if I could do something interesting with them --- apart from
making phone calls and browsing the net, that is. Android is meant to
be very easy to use, and no trickery is required for normal use. The
thing is, I'm not a normal user: I'm a GNU/Linux sysadmin, and just
scratching the surface is not enough for me. So I started
experimenting and gathering information.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="Linux-Android-HOWTO.html#toc1.1">Purpose of this guide</A>
</H2>

<P>This guide is meant to be a quick reference for GNU/Linux users who
want to use their Android device in less-than-trivial ways, and want
their Linux and Android boxes to talk to each other. Most vendors
provide drivers and ancillary programs for Microsoft Windows or Apple
OS X only, but a GNU/Linux system is perfectly capable of interacting
with Android devices. With a bit of hacking, as usual.</P>

<P>In the following, I will share a few tricks I have collected:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> using the Android Debug Bridge;</LI>
<LI> understanding and using the Android file system;</LI>
<LI> installing programs from other markets;</LI>
<LI> copying and syncing files and directories;</LI>
<LI> backing up stuff;</LI>
<LI> using a terminal emulator;</LI>
<LI> compiling native command-line programs;</LI>
<LI> remote control to/from Android;</LI>
<LI> and more.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>I work on a GNU/Linux Mint box, but I'll try and be
distribution-agnostic. I'll concentrate on Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) whenever possible, and I'll take standard, unrooted
Android devices into account. By the way: ``rooting'' means tweaking
your Andbox to gain root permissions, as you would do in Linux with
<CODE>sudo</CODE>. ``Unrooted'' means ``not tweaked''.</P>

<P>Since Android is very fragmented (hey, it's Linux after all!) and
several versions are available, I'll just provide information that is
applicable to what I own: Android 4.0.4, 4.1.1, and 5.0.1 on ARM
architecture. All examples and code in this HOWTO were actually tested
on my devices; hopefully, they should work on your device too. If you
want me to cover more Android versions, I'll be glad to receive new
equipment; or just tips. Equipment is preferred :-)</P>

<P>Currently, the majority of Android devices are ARM based; others are
based on x86 or MIPS CPUs, in both 32 and 64 bit flavours. This is not
a significant difference: most applications are written in Java with
no native code, so they are CPU-agnostic. Instructions in this HOWTO
should work for these Android versions, too. I guess that relevant
differences concern security policies.</P>

<P>Should you have trouble with your Android device, I suggest that you
refer to Android forums. Among the many available, I find the
following especially helpful:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">http://forum.xda-developers.com/</A>
</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://forums.androidcentral.com/">http://forums.androidcentral.com/</A>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Besides: if you find any errors in this guide, please report them to
me.</P>

<P>Thoughout this HOWTO, all instances of ``Linux'' actually mean
``GNU/Linux''. The GNU part is very important, and I'm very grateful
to GNU for its fantastic programs. ``Andbox'' will stand for ``Android
device''.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="Linux-Android-HOWTO.html#toc1.2">Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>I shall assume that you are a reasonably competent Linux user: you
must be able to open a terminal, issue commands, become root, edit
files, compile and install software. No spoon-feeding here.</P>

<P>As far as Android expertise is concerned, only the very basics are
required. You are expected to be able to perform common tasks such as
installing software, enabling USB debugging, using Bluetooth, and so
on. Nothing special, really: in general, you'll have to be able to
find out where options are in your device. I would be glad to provide
information, but unfortunately no identical menus or screens can be
found across different devices of different brands and different
Android releases. You will have to figure it out yourself.</P>

<P>Finally: rooting your device might be desirable, but it's not
necessary as far as this HOWTO is concerned. Root permissions are
normally forbidden in Android, unless an enlightened vendor decides
otherwise. I will mention a great program that needs root access
(Webkey), but the rest of recommended software will not need it. By
the way: in the following, I'll use the appropriate term ``program''
or ``application'', not the marketing term ``app''. (Yep, I'm an old
and grumpy guy.)</P>
