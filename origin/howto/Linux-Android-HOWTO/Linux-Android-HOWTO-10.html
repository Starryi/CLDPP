<P>Congratulations! You have now some basic information on how to turn
your Andbox into something even more useful, and how to interact with it using
your trusted GNU/Linux machine. </P>

<P>At the end of this document, I can confess you the truth: while I'm a
long-term GNU/Linux fan, I'm afraid I've just started to appreciate
Android. I find it insanely fragmented; until recently, it was
unacceptably sluggish and laggy; I also believe it still suffers from
(at least) a couple of serious design flaws. Besides, I don't like
tablets, all of them; I find way too limited, if compared to a real
computer. That said, I can say that my 8-core, Android 5.0.1-based
phone is quite nice.</P>

<P>I hope this guide provided some useful information. It's only the
beginning: please stay tuned for updates.</P>
