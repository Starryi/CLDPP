> The installation of the NVIDIA drivers under Linux can be quite easy
 in itself. However, there is a little more to it sometimes than
 just unpacking the driver files.
 </P
><P
> Since certain versions of the NVIDIA drivers require upgrading your
 XFree86 to work, I've included some material on installing XFree86.
 If upgrading XFree86 is necessary for you, you can read this document
 but also carefully read the information at
 <A
HREF="http://www.XFree86.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>XFree86.org</A
>.
 </P
><P
> The NVIDIA driver is only concerned with installing the OpenGL libGL
 library. But since there is more to a complete OpenGL installation than
 just libGL, I cover the installation of defacto standard OpenGL add-on
 libraries like GL Utility (libGLU) and GL Utility Toolkit (libglut).
 </P
><P
> Going a little beyond the basics, I cover the installation of some
 other libraries you might want to consider:
 <A

><P
>	First of all, the OpenGL drivers for the Nvidia cards currently require
	a system with Linux kernel 2.2.12 or later.  Recent releases of
	kernel 2.4.x are supported and are recommended since most new development
	happens in the 2.4 kernels. If you don't have it, then
	you will have to upgrade your system's Linux kernel; see

	It can be downloaded as source or binaries. It is generally recommended
	to download the binaries these days. See
	<A
HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.XFree86.org</A
> for
	the lastest official information on installation of XFree86.
	Later in this document, I describe only the very basic procedure
	for compiling and installing from the source.
	</P

>
	</P
><P
>	Doctools is the DocBook SGML package used by XFree86 to prepare the X documentation.
	Utils contains the source for the "extract" program, which is a modified GNU tar with
	gzip support. Extract is only important if you are installing a binary distribution
	of XFree86 on top of your existing XFree86 to upgrade it. Extract unlinks old existing
	files that are being extracted/updated instead of skipping them. Extract comes with the
	binary distributions so utils.tgz is only important for making your own binary
	distribution.
	</P

	the OpenGL X interface functions.
	Each window system has to provide the platform-specific interfaces
	between OpenGL and the window system for mapping a GL rendering
	context to a window system widget. Recent versions of XFree86, like
	version 4.2.0, now also include libGLU and the OpenGL manual pages.

>        Mesa is the library that provides the foundation for the 3D support included in XFree86. Originally, Mesa
		included a software-only libGL that only claims to be "similar to that of OpenGL." Mesa now
		also supports hardware acceleration for a growing number of cards (see their site for details).
		The Mesa package also includes an implementation of the libGLU Utility library and the libglut
		GL Utility Toolkit library. Some versions of XFree86 only included the libGL from Mesa and
		some header files. With recent releases of XFree86, like 4.2.0, more has been added
		from Mesa, like libGLU and the manual pages. libglut may still be missing from your XFree86
		distribution, so you may still like to get it from the Mesa distribution or from the GLUT
		distribution directly.
	</P
><P
>	As shipped, XFree86 will support software OpenGL rendering (painfully slow) using the Mesa libGL.
	It may also support hardware accelerated OpenGL for some cards that have a fully open source
	driver. But for NVIDIA, the subject of this document, there is no fully open sourced
	hardware accelerated OpenGL driver included in XFree86. The NVIDIA GLX/OpenGL driver we download
	from <A
HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>NVIDIA.com</A
> is a binary, closed source driver
	that is a drop-in hardware accelerated replacement for the Mesa libGL.so file.
        </P
><P
>        libGLU is a library built on top of libGL to provide some higher-level functions for applications.
        OpenGL itself, libGL, is considered a low-level library. GLU is a standard part of most OpenGL
        installations and many programs make use of it.
        </P
><P
>        MesaDemos provides many OpenGL demo programs and, more importantly, the
		<A
HREF="http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>GL Utility Toolkit</A
>
        (libglut) library. GLUT provides a window system independent interface between OpenGL
		and any supported window system.  For instance, on the X Window System, it
		hides the details of using glX functions to setup a window.  Programmers
		can write code once and can compile it to work on MS Windows or X, etc
		provided that a GLUT library is available on the target platform. Like libGLU, libglut
        is a standard part of most OpenGL installations and is required by many programs.
        </P
><P
>        While GLUT is bundled with MesaDemos, it is also available as separate packages:
        </P
><P
>	glut-3.7.tar.gz
	glut_data-3.7.tar.gz

TARGET="_top"
>http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut/index.html</A
>
	</P
><P
>        You may use <EM
>either</EM
> the GLUT included with MesaDemos (preferred and easier) or the GLUT from its
        project website.  Don't install both!  It's recommended at this time to go with the GLUT
        packaged with MesaDemos, but instructions on how to install the other GLUT are still provided
        in the next section as an option.  Note that MesaDemos does not include the glut manpages, so
        you may want to download the project GLUT package just to install its man pages.

>	In my experience, your video system will become unstable if you compile,
	load, and unload the NVdriver module. You should reboot your system
	after rebuilding this module to help make sure your system doesn't
	lock inside X. Its possible that your screen will go black and the keyboard
	will become unresponsive after switching NVdriver. It is advisable to
	always have another computer with telnet or ssh that you can use to
	get into your Linux box to shut it down properly if this happens.

>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P

    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that

    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes

    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
