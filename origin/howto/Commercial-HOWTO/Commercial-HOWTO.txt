1. About this document

This is the Linux Commercial HOWTO. It contains a listing of commercial
software which is available for Linux. The Linux Commercial HOWTO doesn't
contain any information on Linux distributions -- this is covered by the
Distribution HOWTO.
If you contact any companies or purchase any products listed in this document,
please mention the Linux Commercial HOWTO.
This document was originated by Harald Milz <Harald.Milz@Linux.org>. and then
maintained by Mr. Poet
It is now maintained by Mr. Poet AND LinuxPorts <poet@linuxports.com>.
If you need to know more about the Linux_Documentation_Project or about Linux
HOWTO's, feel free to contact the supervisor Tim Bynum <linux-
howto@metalab.unc.edu>.
Tim Bynum will post the listing to several national and international
newsgroups on a monthly basis. In addition, the Linux Commercial HOWTO can be
found on the World Wide Web at http://commercial.cyrius.com. New versions of
the Linux Commercial HOWTO are always placed at this site first, so please be
sure to check if the copy you are reading is still up to date!
The Linux Commercial HOWTO is not a forum for product announcements or
marketing hype; it is a service for potential customers and the whole Linux
community. Resellers will not be listed; the list is for companies who produce
their software themselves. Two main goals are being aimed at:

* It shall help companies who want to run Linux to find software solutions and
  applications. The international distribution of this list will enhance the
  contact opportunity.
* It is meant to prove the commercial useability of Linux and thus to encourage
  other vendors to port their software as well.

Companies and developers who are offering their products for Linux and
interested in joining the Linux Commercial HOWTO are invited to fill out the
following form and contact me at poet@linuxports.com.
This HOWTO contains tabular entries for each product (example follows). The
entry format is similar to the Linux Software Map (LSM) entry (field/stanza
lengths are arbitrary). If you want me to add your entry please keep short,
otherwise I'll have to shorten your data. Furthermore, please send me plain
ASCII data; no HTML, and no PostScript.

3. Disclaimer

This HOWTO is not actually a HOWTO in the sense of the Linux_Documentation
Project. Instead, it is an instrument to investigate the commercial Linux
opportunity and to list applications which were already ported and marketed in
a native Linux version. As a software vendor, you probably know that you can
alternatively offer Linux users a statically linked SCO version of your
application which would probably run under the iBCS2 emulator (albeit with a
small performance penalty and higher memory requirements). Such applications
will not be listed here.
I will not select nor deselect any particular product. Instead, everyone who
wants to have her product included will be serviced. However, I reserve the
right to shorten individual entries to keep things in shape.
If you don't find a particular product or vendor in this list, this is probably
due to one of the following reasons:

* I never heard of that product or vendor and thus didn't try to get in
  contact.
* I did get in contact, but the vendor didn't answer yet.
* I did get in contact, but the vendor stated positively that he doesn't sell
  his product for Linux (yet).

In any case, please get in contact if you feel someone's missing; also if you
discover any errors in the file.
Sometimes two vendor's addresses are mentioned in the ``Vendor:'' field. In
these cases I received the information from the German subsidiary/distributor.
The original manufacturer's address is always mentioned first.

5. Linux for the Commercial Market?

Copyright © 1996 iX Multiuser Multitasking Magazin
Courtesy of iX Multiuser Multitasking Magazin!
People keep asking me ``When is Linux going to be ready for the commercial
market''. I guess the first thing to discuss is what is meant by "commercial"
in this context.
Some CD-ROM vendors have put the word "commercial" in their name, only to have
the technical people think their product is good only for use by banks and
insurance companies. Other people look at their product with disdain and say
that ``Linux is not commercial quality'', because it is missing some feature
they need, or they feel it is unstable (usually without ever trying it even one
time).
To me, the word ``commercial'' has lost as much meaning in the marketplace as
some of the other buzzwords:

* ``Open'' vs ``Proprietary'' (People are now saying UNIX is ``Proprietary'')
* ``Workstation'' vs ``PC'' (What is a workstation, anyway?)

In the old days of computing the commercial market was banks, insurance
companies and business-oriented facilities where the use of COBOL or RPG was
the mainstream. The technical market was scientific, engineering and
manufacturing where FORTRAN and assembly language was used. Somewhere along the
way the term ``commercial'' seems to have gotten twisted around to mean ``ready
for the mass market'', versus ``ready for hackers''.
For the purpose of this article I will take the second meaning, and address
whether I think Linux is ready for commercial purposes rather than the hobbyist
and hacker market, and ready for the mass market rather than limited markets.
For those of you who hate reading long articles, or who are short on time, let
me give you my conclusion right now. Then you can go out and drink beer or
other fun activities:
``Yes, Linux is ready for the commercial market...in some cases''.
In order for an operating system to be ready for the mass market it must have
several attributes:

* have lots of applications
* be relatively easy to install
* have lots of applications
* be relatively easy to maintain
* have lots of applications
* be relatively easy to use
* have lots of applications
* not crash (much)
* have lots of applications
* be economical
* have lots of applications

But you can eliminate all of these considerations in today's mass market if
only one thing is true:
You have lots of applications.
after all, there would not be 170,000,000 DOS systems in the world if any of
the others had to be true.
I almost added that is has to be economical, but history has actually proven me
wrong on that. If people added up the total cost of ownership, then Apple would
certainly have won over the PC. But people ignore the human costs of someone
else (or even themselves) beating their head against the wall trying to get
something to work, or the system crashing repeatedly, or the fact that the one
keystroke they can hit the easiest (through practice) is


               <CTRL><ALT><DEL>


In the old days people were content to spend several hundreds of dollars on a
simple ASCII text editor, or deal with a simple spreadsheet. And it took an act
of mangement to get them, with lots of Purchase Orders. Today, they want multi-
media integrated with their operating system, and have all the applications
available that their neighbor (or boss, or compatriot) has available on their
system. And they want to get these applications easily, certainly no harder
than to call up on the phone to order them through a catalog, or go down to
their corner store to get them.
Now what causes this plethora of applications for an operating system? Ease of
programming? Good software development tools? Features inside the operating
system? Stability of the interfaces over time?
The answer is ``none of these''. While all these attributes may help convince
an application developer to port, the one overriding issue is volume of the
operating system platform. Again, if MSDOS were compared to MacOS, or even to
UNIX and volume were not taken into account, we know which two operating
systems would have the most applications, and they would not be from Microsoft.
While it is true that several Linux vendors are working on getting these
applications for the mass market (read this " your mother and father"), the
number of applications that run on Microsoft platforms have been estimated as
high as 35,000. SunOS has an estimated 10,000 applications, with other
`commercial UNIX'' systems (including Solaris 2.x) much lower in number. It
will take the Linux vendors a long time to get the number of applications
necessary to hit the really large mass market, particularly if they did not
depend on iBCS2 and DOS/Windows compatibility (which could supply a fair number
of current applications), but depended on ``native'' Linux applications.
So applications are king (and queen) for the mass market, and installed base
(volume) or the promise of explosive growth (volume) is the key to these. But
is the mass market the only ``commercial'' market? The answer is ``no''. The
mass market is a subset (albeit very large one) of the commercial market. So
let's look at what the rest of the commercial market needs. We will look at
this by segmenting the market into:

* turnkey systems
* large end-user customers
* specialized markets


5.1 Turnkey systems

When I speak of turnkey systems I typically mean a computer system that has one
specific (or not so specific) application that runs on it. Examples of turnkey
systems are point-of-sale terminals, reservation systems, CAD systems, etc. But
in a larger sense, other applications such as Web servers, nameservers (such as
BIND), etc. could also be considered ``turnkey'', since they have only a few
necessary programs that have to run on the system.
Usually turnkey systems are ones that an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) or
Value Added Reseller (VAR) will chose a hardware system, an operating system,
port an application to it, then duplicate that system 500 to 1000 times without
change to the basic application. These ISVs and VARs will try to chose the
lowest cost solution to fit their customer's needs.
Linux is perfect for these types of applications. The operating system is
stable enough for the developer to port their application and test the
application fully. Once it is fully tested and stable, the entire package is
``frozen'' and duplicated any number of times for the end customer.
Since the operating system may be freely copied, and it runs on inexpensive
hardware, their variable costs are minimal. Even a developer who is not
familiar with the Linux system (so they need help getting it running on a
platform) will quickly pay back the porting and system programmer costs they
accrue by not paying $200-$500. per license for the operating system. Plus they
have all the source code for the entire system, in case they run into trouble
later on. You can buy a lot of Linux support for $200-$500K.
As I said before, I include Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as part of this
``turnkey'' environment, for both external internet and internal internet. Why
overload your expensive, high-powered, highly complex general-purpose server to
do Web serving when a smaller, simpler box can offload it? Why not run your NIS
slaves on a Linux box? Or perhaps your BIND server?
In the early days of Digital UNIX (known then as DEC OSF/1) we did not have
very many applications. In fact we had none. The marketing staff came to me
with sad faces asking if it was possible to sell an operating system that had
no applications. I invented a term called ``Turbocharging'', which allowed a
Digital UNIX system using the speed and power of the Alpha processor (as well
as the throughput of our networking devices) to offload NIS, NFS, BIND and
other services from people's overloaded, slower SPARC machines. We also showed
people how they could use the rsh(1) command to allow the Alpha to do a portion
of their very CPU intensive processing while delivering the result back to the
SPARCs on their desk. This allowed the SPARCs to work more on applications and
less on the other ``system administration'' tasks that they were performing. We
sold lots of Digital UNIX systems based solely on executing those tasks. Today,
of course, Digital UNIX has a lot more applications, and particularly very
large memory databases that are extremely fast. But the same principle applies.
The database engine runs on the Alpha system, supplying data to the slower
SPARC engines as a ``Turbocharger''. I could see Linux systems headed in the
same direction, following the same path.

5.2 Large end-user customers

Very large customers often have their own home-grown applications which they
need to deploy across a wide network of people. Or they can have management
dictate a certain suite of applications, which then can be ported to Linux.
Since these customers are so large, their operating system costs are huge, and
utilizing the savings using the Linux operating system they may completely
cover the expenses of porting their software.
Or these very large customers may ``influence'' their layered product providers
to port to the Linux platform. Finally, they may even change some of their
computing habits (to use existing programs) if the cost savings are enough to
warrant it.
Companies like Caldera are creating a suite of applications and approaching
these very large customers to show them the operating system savings that they
can achieve if they switch to Linux. While it is true that every application
the customer could ever conceive of running may not run on Linux, by using the
native applications, the iBCS2 applications, the DOSEMU applications, and
applications that run under WABI, a nice suite of applications could be built
to solve their needs.

5.3 Specialized markets

Finally there are what I call ``specialized markets''. Markets that might buy
Linux simply because it is Linux, and not because of the application suites
that it provides.
In the education field there are three main markets:

* administrative
* ``campus computing''
* computer science education

The administrative part is the ``business'' aspect of the market. They are
looking for easy-to-use systems that can also handle complex administrative
tasks that might cover a community the size of a small city.
The ``campus computing'' is the supply of computing power and service for
majors of all types, web services and research into non-computer science (for
example, molecular modeling) research.
Finally there is computer science education, both on the undergraduate and
graduate level, as well as research into computer science.
While the administrative sub-market typically relies more on shrink-wrapped
applications, the other two rely on them to a lesser extent (with the computer
science education market relying the least). The other two markets can utilize
a lot more of the freeware and shareware applications that are already ported
to Linux. This gives them a very low-cost (from a software perspective)
platform while allowing them to see and (often) modify the source code for the
applications they use.
More importantly, in the computer science research area, the results of the
research can be freely distributed to others working in the field, or even
published as source code to illustrate the results. This can not be done with
``commercial'' operating systems.
Some universities are utilizing Linux more and more to run their campus. From a
``commercial'' standpoint, their needs are the same as many large businesses.
Students graduating from college will know about Linux, and bring the word to
their future employers.
Finally, there is the computer hobbyist and software developer market. I relate
this market to the amateur radio market. In the amateur radio market the radio
is often used to simply talk to other people, but at the same time the users
investigate new ways of using radio, and improving it. Many electrical
engineers started out as amateur radio users. So it can be with Linux, since
for the first time both the prices of the hardware and the prices of the
operating system source code are within the reach of mortal people.
In conclusion, I feel that Linux does have the items needed for several types
of ``commercial'' uses:

* stability and quality
* low variable costs for turnkey applications
* explosive growth in volume to attract ISVs

What Linux really needs is for the ``commercial'' community to understand what
is going on, and to embrace it where it will be useful. This will increase the
volume numbers even more, which will attract more applications.
Along these lines I would like to ``advertise'' a joint effort of USENIX and
Linux International to happen in January of 1997 in Anaheim, California of the
United States. There will be a joint USENIX/Linux development conference, and
while a certain part of the Linux conference will be oriented towards the
development of the Linux operating system, the bulk of the conference will be
oriented towards application developers and marketing people, to better
understand the Linux operating system and how to sell their applications and
services into the Linux market. We hope to show ISVs, VARs, resellers and
distributors how they can make money by selling their applications and services
on top of the Linux operating system.
