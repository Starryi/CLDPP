At the
LinuxChix BOF at Ottawa Linux Symposium, we finished listing all the
reasons why women stayed away from LUGs.  A man from the local LUG
raised his hand and said that no one at his LUG did any of the things
we complained about, but they were still having difficulty attracting
women.  A woman from the same LUG raised her hand and said, "Yes, they
do."  She went on to say that only a few "bad apples" were doing these
things, but those few were enough to drive off most women.  This is a
very important point: if your group has nine helpful and polite
members, and one rude, sexist, loud member, most women are going to
continue to stay away because of that one member.  I realize that this
isn't fair to the other people in the group, but that's reality.  If
your group is stuck with one bad apple, try a little peer pressure the
next time he does something that will drive off women.  Reply to his
email, disagree with what he says--establish that you don't share his
opinions.  Just knowing that there is one other person in the group
who is willing to publicly disagree with the "bad apple" will help
immensely, and will make women more willing to stay.</p><p>In my own experience, I have over and over again heard a man say
that he doesn't do any of these things, and then observed him hours or
minutes later doing exactly what he claimed he doesn't do.  I don't
think any of those men were lying, just completely unaware.  Making
sexist jokes or comments seems to be the most unconscious behavior -
many men just don't realize that what they're saying is offensive to
women.</p><p>Also, it's definitely possible to have good intentions and still
drive away women.  You may think you're encouraging a woman by
congratulating her on being brave enough to show up to an event, but
you're actually pointing out to her that she's weird and unusual,
rather than making her feel like part of the community.  As one woman
put it, "I know I'm an alien. You don't need to emphasize it."  We're
hoping that this HOWTO will help you realize when you are
unintentionally driving away women.</p><p>If you're curious about how your behavior appears to women, my
best suggestion is to find a woman you know who tends to be blunt and
outspoken, and ask her if she remembers you saying or doing something
offensive to women.  You might be surprised at her response.
Remember, most women would rather chew off a leg than be rude to a man
to his face, so it may be difficult to get an honest
answer.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="apa.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3. Do's and don't's of encouraging women in Linux </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> A. LinuxChix </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
