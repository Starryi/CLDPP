>Linux is a freely-distributable implementation of Unix for
inexpensive personal machines (it was developed on 386s, and now supports
486, 586, Pentium, PowerPC, Sun Sparc, ARM and DEC Alpha hardware, and even
the IBM System 390 mainframe!). It supports a wide range of software,
including X Windows, Emacs, TCP/IP networking (including SLIP), and many
applications.</P
><P
>This document assumes that you have heard of and know about Linux,
and now want to get it running.  It focuses on the Intel
base version, which is the most popular, but much of the advice
applies on Power PCs, Sparcs and Alphas as well.</P

books about Linux, all of which are freely distributable on the
net and available from the LDP home page.</P
><P
>The book <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"

as well as how to use the system once you've installed it. It contains a
complete tutorial to using and running the system, and much more
information than is contained here.  You can browse it, or download a copy,
from the LDP home page.</P

who will assemble a workstation for you, install and configure a
Linux, and do an intensive burn-in to test it before it's shipped

reliability or performance requirements, these integrators provide
a valuable service by making sure you won't get hardware that's

the actual hardware requirements for the system change periodically.  The
<A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Hardware-HOWTO</A
>, gives
a (more or less) complete listing of hardware supported by Linux. The
<A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-SHEET.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux INFO-SHEET</A
>, provides
another list.</P
><P
>For the Intel versions, a hardware configuration that looks like the
following is required:</P
><P
>Any 80386,
80486,
Pentium or Pentium
II processor will do.
Non-Intel clones of the 80386 and up will generally work. You do not need a
math coprocessor, although it is nice to have one.</P
><P
>The ISA,
EISA, VESA Local
Bus and
PCI bus architectures are
supported. The MCA bus
architecture (found on IBM PS/2 machines) has been minimally supported
since the 2.1.x kernels, but may not be ready for prime time yet.</P
><P
>You need at least 4 megabytes of memory in your machine. Technically,
Linux will run with only 2 megs, but most installations and software
require 4. The more memory you have, the happier you'll be. I suggest an
absolute minimum of 16 megabytes if you're planning to use X-Windows; 64 is
better.</P
><P
>Of course, you'll need a hard drive and an AT-standard drive
controller. All MFM,
RLL, and
IDE drives and controllers
should work.  Many SCSI drives and adaptors are supported as well; the
Linux SCSI-HOWTO contains more information on SCSI.  If you are assembling
a system from scratch to run Linux, the small additional cost of SCSI is
well worth it for the extra performance and reliability it brings.</P
><P
>You'll want a CD-ROM
drive; effectively all Linux distributions are now CD-ROM based.  If your
machine was built in 1998 or later, you should be able to actually boot 
your Linux's installer right off the CD-ROM without using a boot
floppy.</P
><P
>If your CD-ROM is ATAPI,
SCSI, or true
IDE you should have no problem
making it work (but watch for cheap drives advertising "IDE" interfaces
that aren't true IDE).  If your CD-ROM uses a proprietary interface card,
it's possible the installation kernel you're going to boot from floppy
won't be able to see it -- and an inaccessible CD-ROM is a installation
show-stopper.  Also, CD-ROMs that attach to your parallel port won't work
at all.  If you're in doubt, consult the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/CDROM-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux CD-ROM HOWTO</A
> for a list and
details of supported hardware.</P
><P
>If your CD-ROM isn't in your machine's boot sequence, you will need a
3.5" floppy drive.  While 5.25" floppies are supported under
Linux, they are little-enough used that you should not count on disk images
necessarily fitting on them.  (A stripped-down Linux can actually run on a
single floppy, but that's only useful for installation and certain
troubleshooting tasks.)</P
><P
>You also need an MDA,
Hercules, CGA,
EGA,
VGA, or Super
VGA video card and
monitor.  In general, if your video card and monitor work under MS-DOS or
Windows then they should work under Linux. However, if you wish to run the
X window system, there are other restrictions on the supported video
hardware. The <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XFree86-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux
XFree86-HOWTO</A
>, contains more information about running X and its
requirements.</P
><P
>If you're running on a box that uses one of the Motorola 68K
processors (including Amiga,
Atari, or
VMEbus machines), see the
<A
HREF="http://www.linux-m68k.org/pub/faq/faq.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux/m68k FAQ</A
>
for information on minimum requirements and the state of the port.  The FAQ
now says m68k Linux is as stable and usable as the Intel versions.</P

NAME="DISKSPACE"
>4.2. Space requirements and coexistence</A
></H3
><P
>You'll need free space for Linux on your hard drive. The amount of
space needed depends on how much software you plan to install. Today most
installations require somewhere in the ballpark of a gigabyte of space.
This includes space for the software, swap space (used as virtual
RAM on your machine), and free space for users, and so on.</P
><P
>It's conceivable that you could run a minimal Linux system in 80 megs
or less (this used to be common when Linux distributions were smaller), and
it's conceivable that you could use two gigabytes or more for all of your
Linux software. The amount varies greatly depending on the amount of
software you install and how much space you require. More about this
later.</P
><P
>Linux will co-exist with other operating systems, such as MS-DOS,
Microsoft Windows, or OS/2, on your hard drive. (In fact you can even
access MS-DOS files and run some MS-DOS programs from Linux.)  In other
words, when partitioning your drive for Linux, MS-DOS or OS/2 live on their
own partitions, and Linux exists on its own. We'll go into more detail
about such ``dual-boot''
systems later.</P
><P
>You do <EM
>not</EM
> need to be running MS-DOS, OS/2, or
any other operating system to use Linux. Linux is a completely
stand-alone operating system and does not rely on other OSs for
installation and use.</P
><P
>In all, the minimal setup for Linux is not much more than is
required for most MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 systems sold today (and
it's a good deal less than the minimum for Windows 95!).  If you
have a 386 or 486 with at least 4 megs of RAM, then you'll be happy
running Linux. Linux does not require huge amounts of disk space,
memory, or processor speed.  Matt Welsh, the originator of this
HOWTO, used to run Linux on a 386/16 MHz (the slowest machine you
can get) with 4 megs of RAM, and was quite happy. The more you want
to do, the more memory (and faster processor) you'll need. In our
experience a 486 with 16 megabytes of RAM running Linux outdoes
several models of expensive workstations.</P

>4.4. Choosing a Linux distribution</A
></H3
><P
>Before you can install Linux, you need to decide on one of the
``distributions'' of Linux which are available. There is no single,
standard release of the Linux software---there are many such
releases.  Each release has its own documentation and installation
instructions.  All distributions pretty much share the same underlying
codebase, however.</P
><P
>Linux distributions are available both via anonymous FTP and via mail
order on diskette, tape, and CD-ROM. There are many checklists and
comparative
reviews of Linux distributions out there. The <A
HREF="http://lwn.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Weekly News site</A
>, in addition to
being an excellent general source of news and information, carries a
weekly report on distributions with pointers to many of them.</P
><P
>In the dim and ancient past when this HOWTO was first written
(1992-93), most people got Linux by tortuous means involving long
downloads off the Internet or a BBS onto their DOS machines,
followed by an elaborate procedure which transferred the downloads
onto multiple floppy disks.  One of these disks would then be
booted and used to install the other dozen.  With luck (and no
media failures) you'd finish your installation many hours later
with a working Linux.  Or maybe not.</P
><P
>While this path is still possible (and you can download any one of
several distributions from <A
HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/"
TARGET="_top"
>Metalab</A
>),
there are now much less strenuous ways. The easiest is to buy one of the
high-quality commercial Linux distributions distributed on CD-ROM, such as
Red Hat, Debian, Linux Pro, or WGS.  These are typically available for less
than $50 at your local bookstore or computer shop, and will save you
many hours of aggravation.</P
><P
>You can also buy anthology CD-ROMs such as the InfoMagic Linux
Developer's Resource set. These typically include several Linux
distributions and a recent dump of major Linux archive sites, such
as metalab or tsx-11.</P
><P
>In the remainder of this HOWTO we will focus on the steps needed to
install from an anthology CD-ROM, or one of the lower-end
commercial Linuxes that doesn't include a printed installation
manual.  If your Linux includes a paper manual some of this HOWTO may
provide useful background, but you should consult the manual for
detailed installation instructions.</P

before installing.  Know the vendor and model number of each card
in your machine; collect the IRQs and DMA channel numbers.  You
probably won't need this information -- but if it turns out you do,
you'll need it very badly.</P

BIOS settings to see if it has the capability to boot from CD-ROM.  Most
machines made after mid-1997 can do this.</P

>If yours is among them, change the settings so that the CD-ROM is checked
first.  This is often in a 'BIOS FEATURES' submenu of the BIOS
configuration menus.</P

There are a few things you can do before you start that will lessen
your chances of being stopped by this kind of problem.</P

>First, collect any manuals you have on your hardware -- motherboard,
video card, monitor, modem, etc. -- and put them within easy reach.</P
><P
>Second, gather detailed information on your hardware configuration.
One easy way to do this, if you're running MS-DOS 5.0, or up, is to
print a report from the Microsoft diagnostic utility msd.exe (you
can leave out the TSR, driver, memory-map, environment-strings and
OS-version parts).  Among other things, this will guarantee you
full and correct information on your video card and mouse type,
which will be helpful in configuring X later on.</P

supported hardware that could cause an un-recoverable lockup
during Linux installation.</P

><LI
><P
>Is any of your peripheral hardware designed with neither
configuration jumpers nor non-volatile configuration memory?  If
so, it may require boot-time initialization via an MS-DOS utility
to start up, and may not be easily accessible from Linux.  CD-ROMs,
sound cards, Ethernet cards and low-end tape drives can have this
problem.  If so, you may be able to work around this with an
argument to the boot prompt; see the<A

you through the process of building boot, root, and rescue disks

program (such as the Red Hat <B

(a) the bootdisk images on your CD-ROM are named in a way that will help
you pick a correct one, or (b) there's an index file nearby describing each
image.</P

and optionally from the rescue disk images.  This is where the MS-DOS
program RAWRITE.EXE comes into play.</P

MS-DOS formatted floppies.  (They must be of the same type; that is, if
your boot floppy drive is a 3.5" drive, both floppies must be
high-density 3.5" disks.) You will use RAWRITE.EXE to write the
bootdisk images to the floppies.</P

boot disk, the other containing the root disk. Note that these two floppies
will no longer be readable by MS-DOS (they are ``Linux format'' floppies,
in some sense).</P

MS-DOS partition.) Instead, you use the ``UMSDOS filesystem'', which allows
you to treat a directory of your MS-DOS partition as a Linux filesystem. In
this way, you don't have to repartition your drive.</P
></TD

></TABLE

><P
>I only suggest using this method if your drive already has four
partitions (the maximum supported by DOS) and repartitioning would
be more trouble than it's worth (it slows down your Linux due to
filename translation overhead).  Or, if you want to try out Linux
before repartitioning, this is a good way to do so. But in most
cases you should re-partition, as described here. If you do plan to
use UMSDOS, you are on your own -- it is not documented in detail
here. From now on, we assume that you are NOT using UMSDOS, and
that you will be repartitioning.</P
><P
>A <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>partition</I
> is just a section of the hard drive
set aside for a particular operating system to use. If you only have MS-DOS
installed, your hard drive probably has just one partition, entirely for
MS-DOS. To use Linux, however, you'll need to repartition the drive, so
that you have one partition for MS-DOS, and one (or more) for Linux.</P
><P
>Partitions come in three flavors: <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>primary</I
>,
<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>extended</I
>, and <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>logical</I
>.  Briefly,
primary partitions are one of the four main partitions on your
drive. However, if you wish to have more than four partitions per drive,
you need to replace the last primary partition with an extended partition,
which can contain many logical partitions.  You don't store data directly
on an extended partition---it is used only as a container for logical
partitions. Data is stored only on either primary or logical
partitions.</P
><P
>To put this another way, most people use only primary partitions.
However, if you need more than four partitions on a drive, you
create an extended partition. Logical partitions are then created
on top of the extended partition, and there you have it---more than
four partitions per drive.</P
><P
>Note that you can easily install Linux on the second drive on your
system (known as D: to MS-DOS). You simply specify the
appropriate device name when creating Linux partitions. This is
described in detail below.</P
><P
>Back to repartitioning your drive. It used to be that there was no way to
resize partitions without destroying the data on them.  Nowadays there are
partitioning utilities that can resize non-destructively; they know about
the structure of file systems, can find the free space on a file system,
and can move file data around on the partition to move free space where it
needs to be in order for a resize to work properly.  It's still suggested
that you make a full backup before using one of these, in case of program
or human error.</P
><P
>Under Linux <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted"
TARGET="_top"
>GNU
parted</A
> allows you to create, destroy, resize and copy partitions.  It
supports ext2, FAT16, and FAT32 filesystems, Linux swap devices; it also
knows about MS-DOS disk labels. Parted is useful for creating space for new
operating systems, reorganising disk usage, copying data between hard
disks, and disk imaging.  It is relatively new code, but is reported to
work well and not trash data.</P
><P
>There is a non-destructive disk repartitioner available for MS-DOS,
called <A
HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/install"
TARGET="_top"
>FIPS</A
>. With
FIPS, a disk optimizer (such as Norton Speed Disk), and a little bit of
luck, you should be able to resize MS-DOS partitions without destroying the
data on them.</P
><P
>The older method of resizing a partition, if you don't have one of these
resizing partition editors available, is to delete the partition(s), and
re-create them with smaller sizes.  If you use this method, you absolutely
must make a backup in order to save any of your data.</P
><P
>The classic way to modify partitions is with the program
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FDISK</B
>. For example, let's say that you have an 80 meg
hard drive, dedicated to MS-DOS. You'd like to split it in half---40 megs
for MS-DOS and 40 megs for Linux. In order to do this, you run
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FDISK</B
> under MS-DOS, delete the 80 meg MS-DOS partition,
and re-create a 40 meg MS-DOS partition in its place. You can then format
the new partition and reinstall your MS-DOS software from backups. 40
megabytes of the drive is left empty. Later, you create Linux partitions on
the unused portion of the drive.</P

your machine, and a 10-megabyte swap partition, as far as Linux is
concerned you have 14 megabytes of virtual memory.</P
><P
>When using swap space, Linux moves unused pages of memory out to
disk, allowing you to run more applications at once on your system.
However, because swapping is often slow, it's no replacement for
real physical RAM. But applications that require a great deal of
memory (such as the X window system) often rely on swap space if
you don't have enough physical RAM.</P
><P
>Nearly all Linux users employ a swap partition.  If you have 4
megabytes of RAM or less, a swap partition is required to install
the software. It is strongly recommended that you have a swap
partition anyway, unless you have a great amount of physical RAM.</P
><P
>The size of your swap partition depends on how much virtual memory
you need. It's often suggested that you have at least 16 megabytes
of virtual memory total. Therefore, if you have 8 megs of physical
RAM, you might want to create an 8-megabyte swap partition.  Note that
there are platform-dependent limits on the size of swap partitions;
see the Partition-HOWTO if you want to create a swap partition larger
than 1GB.</P

>LILO is a boot loader, which can be used to select either Linux,
MS-DOS, or some other operating system at boot time.  Chances are
your distribution automatically configured LILO for you during the
installation phase (unless you're using OS/2, this is what you
should have done).  If so, you can skip the rest of this section.</P
><P
>If you installed LILO as the <EM
>primary</EM
> boot
loader, it will handle the first-stage booting process for all operating
systems on your drive. This works well if MS-DOS is the only other
operating system that you have installed. However, you might be running
OS/2, which has its own Boot Manager. In this case, you want OS/2's Boot
Manager to be the primary boot loader, and use LILO just to boot Linux (as
the <EM
>secondary</EM
> boot loader).</P
><P
>An important gotcha for people using EIDE systems: due to a BIOS
limitation, your boot sectors for any OS have to live on one of the
first two physical disks.  Otherwise LILO will hang after writing
"LI", no matter where you run it from.</P
><P
>If you have to configure LILO manually, this will involve editing the
file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>. Below we present an example of a
LILO configuration file, where the Linux root partition is on
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
>, and MS-DOS is installed on
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb1</TT
> (on the second hard drive).</P

>Now let's say that you want to use LILO as the secondary boot
loader; if you want to boot Linux from OS/2's Boot Manager, for
example.  In order to boot a Linux partition from OS/2 Boot
Manager, unfortunately, you must create the partition using OS/2's
<B

> (not Linux's), and format the partition as FAT or
HPFS, so that OS/2 knows about it.  (That's IBM for you.)</P

>In order to have LILO boot Linux from OS/2 Boot Manager, you only
want to install LILO on your Linux root filesystem (in the above
example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT

should look something like:</P
