<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction </A></H2>

<P>This HOWTO document describes programming hardware I/O ports and
waiting for small periods of time in user-mode Linux programs running
on the Intel x86 architecture. This document is a descendant of the
very small IO-Port mini-HOWTO by the same author.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Using I/O ports in C programs</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The normal method</A>
</H2>

<P>Routines for accessing I/O ports are in <CODE>/usr/include/asm/io.h</CODE>
(or <CODE>linux/include/asm-i386/io.h</CODE> in the kernel source
distribution). The routines there are inline macros, so it is enough
to <CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE>; you do not need any additional
libraries.</P>
<P>Because of a limitation in gcc (present in all versions I know of,
including egcs), you <EM>have to</EM> compile any source code that uses
these routines with optimisation turned on (<CODE>gcc -O1</CODE> or higher),
or alternatively use <CODE>#define extern static</CODE> before you
<CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE> (remember to <CODE>#undef
extern</CODE>afterwards).</P>
<P>For debugging, you can use <CODE>gcc -g -O</CODE> (at least with modern
versions of gcc), though optimisation can sometimes make the debugger
behave a bit strangely. If this bothers you, put the routines that use
I/O port access in a separate source file and compile only that with
optimisation turned on.</P>

<H3>Permissions</H3>

<P>Before you access any ports, you must give your program permission to
do so. This is done by calling the <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> function (declared
in <CODE>unistd.h</CODE>, and defined in the kernel) somewhere near the start
of your program (before any I/O port accesses). The syntax is
<CODE>ioperm(from, num, turn_on)</CODE>, where <CODE>from</CODE> is the first port
number to give access to, and <CODE>num</CODE> the number of consecutive ports
to give access to. For example, <CODE>ioperm(0x300, 5, 1)</CODE> would give
access to ports 0x300 through 0x304 (a total of 5 ports). The last
argument is a Boolean value specifying whether to give access to the
program to the ports (true (1)) or to remove access (false (0)). You
can call <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> multiple times to enable multiple
non-consecutive ports. See the <CODE>ioperm(2)</CODE> manual page for details
on the syntax.</P>
<P>The <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> call requires your program to have root privileges;
thus you need to either run it as the root user, or make it setuid
root. You can drop the root privileges after you have called
<CODE>ioperm()</CODE> to enable the ports you want to use. You are not
required to explicitly drop your port access privileges with
<CODE>ioperm(..., 0)</CODE> at the end of your program; this is done
automatically as the process exits.</P>
<P>A <CODE>setuid()</CODE> to a non-root user does not disable the port access
granted by <CODE>ioperm()</CODE>, but a <CODE>fork()</CODE> does (the child process
does not get access, but the parent retains it).</P>
<P><CODE>ioperm()</CODE> can only give access to ports 0x000 through 0x3ff; for
higher ports, you need to use <CODE>iopl()</CODE> (which gives you access to
all ports at once). Use the level argument 3 (i.e., <CODE>iopl(3)</CODE>) to
give your program access to <EM>all</EM> I/O ports (so be careful ---
accessing the wrong ports can do all sorts of nasty things to your
computer). Again, you need root privileges to call <CODE>iopl()</CODE>. See
the <CODE>iopl(2)</CODE> manual page for details.</P>

<H3>Accessing the ports</H3>


<P>To input a byte (8 bits) from a port, call <CODE>inb(port)</CODE>, it returns
the byte it got. To output a byte, call <CODE>outb(value, port)</CODE> (please
note the order of the parameters). To input a word (16 bits) from
ports <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>x+1</CODE> (one byte from each to form the word, using
the assembler instruction <CODE>inw</CODE>), call <CODE>inw(x)</CODE>. To output a
word to the two ports, use <CODE>outw(value, x)</CODE>. If you're unsure of
which port instructions (byte or word) to use, you probably want
<CODE>inb()</CODE> and <CODE>outb()</CODE> --- most devices are designed for bytewise
port access. Note that all port access instructions take at least
about a microsecond to execute.</P>
<P>The <CODE>inb_p()</CODE>, <CODE>outb_p()</CODE>, <CODE>inw_p()</CODE>, and <CODE>outw_p()</CODE>
macros work otherwise identically to the ones above, but they do an
additional short (about one microsecond) delay after the port access;
you can make the delay about four microseconds with <CODE>#define
REALLY_SLOW_IO</CODE> before you <CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE>. These
macros normally (unless you <CODE>#define SLOW_IO_BY_JUMPING</CODE>, which
is probably less accurate) use a port output to port 0x80 for their
delay, so you need to give access to port 0x80 with <CODE>ioperm()</CODE>
first (outputs to port 0x80 should not affect any part of the
system). For more versatile methods of delaying, read on.</P>
<P>There are manual pages for <CODE>ioperm(2)</CODE>, <CODE>iopl(2)</CODE>, and the above
macros in reasonably recent releases of the Linux manual page
collection.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 An alternate method: <CODE>/dev/port</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Another way to access I/O ports is to <CODE>open()</CODE> <CODE>/dev/port</CODE> (a
character device, major number 1, minor 4) for reading and/or writing
(the stdio <CODE>f*()</CODE> functions have internal buffering, so avoid
them). Then <CODE>lseek()</CODE> to the appropriate byte in the file (file
position 0 = port 0x00, file position 1 = port 0x01, and so on), and
<CODE>read()</CODE> or <CODE>write()</CODE> a byte or word from or to it.</P>
<P>Naturally, for this to work your program needs read/write access to
<CODE>/dev/port</CODE>. This method is probably slower than the normal
method above, but does not need compiler optimisation nor
<CODE>ioperm()</CODE>. It doesn't need root access either, if you give a
non-root user or group access to <CODE>/dev/port</CODE> --- but this is a
very bad thing to do in terms of system security, since it is possible
to hurt the system, perhaps even gain root access, by using
<CODE>/dev/port</CODE> to access hard disks, network cards, etc. directly.</P>
<P>You cannot use <CODE>select(2)</CODE> or <CODE>poll(2)</CODE> to read /dev/port,
because the hardware does not have a facility for notifying the CPU
when a value in an input port changes.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Interrupts (IRQs) and DMA access</A></H2>

<P>You cannot use IRQs or DMA directly from a user-mode process. You need
to write a kernel driver; see 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com:8080/HyperNews/get/khg.html">The Linux Kernel Hacker's Guide</A> for details and the kernel source code
for examples.</P>
<P>You can disable interrupts from within a user-mode program, though it can
be dangerous (even kernel drivers do it for as short a time as possible).
After calling <CODE>iopl(3)</CODE>, you can disable interrupts simply by calling
<CODE>asm("cli");</CODE>, and re-enable them with <CODE>asm("sti");</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s4">4. High-resolution timing</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Delays</A>
</H2>

<P>First of all, I should say that you cannot guarantee user-mode
processes to have exact control of timing because of the multi-tasking
nature of Linux. Your process might be scheduled out at any time for
anything from about 10 milliseconds to a few seconds (on a system with
very high load). However, for most applications using I/O ports, this
does not really matter. To minimise this, you may want to nice your
process to a high-priority value (see the <CODE>nice(2)</CODE> manual page) or
use real-time scheduling (see below).</P>
<P>If you want more precise timing than normal user-mode processes give
you, there are some provisions for user-mode `real time' support.
Linux 2.x kernels have soft real time support; see the manual page for
<CODE>sched_setscheduler(2)</CODE> for details. There is a special kernel that
supports hard real time; see 
<A HREF="http://luz.cs.nmt.edu/~rtlinux/">http://luz.cs.nmt.edu/~rtlinux/</A> for more information on
this.</P>

<H3>Sleeping: <CODE>sleep()</CODE> and <CODE>usleep()</CODE></H3>

<P>Now, let me start with the easier timing calls. For delays of multiple
seconds, your best bet is probably to use <CODE>sleep()</CODE>. For delays of
at least tens of milliseconds (about 10 ms seems to be the minimum
delay), <CODE>usleep()</CODE> should work. These functions give the CPU to
other processes (``sleep''), so CPU time isn't wasted. See the manual
pages <CODE>sleep(3)</CODE> and <CODE>usleep(3)</CODE> for details.</P>
<P>For delays of under about 50 milliseconds (depending on the speed of
your processor and machine, and the system load), giving up the CPU
takes too much time, because the Linux scheduler (for the x86
architecture) usually takes at least about 10-30 milliseconds before
it returns control to your process. Due to this, in small delays,
<CODE>usleep(3)</CODE> usually delays somewhat more than the amount that you
specify in the parameters, and at least about 10 ms.</P>

<H3><CODE>nanosleep()</CODE></H3>

<P>In the 2.0.x series of Linux kernels, there is a new system call,
<CODE>nanosleep()</CODE> (see the <CODE>nanosleep(2)</CODE> manual page), that allows
you to sleep or delay for short times (a few microseconds or more).</P>
<P>For delays &lt;= 2 ms, if (and only if) your process is set to soft
real time scheduling (using <CODE>sched_setscheduler()</CODE>),
<CODE>nanosleep()</CODE> uses a busy loop; otherwise it sleeps, just like
<CODE>usleep()</CODE>.</P>
<P>The busy loop uses <CODE>udelay()</CODE> (an internal kernel function used by
many kernel drivers), and the length of the loop is calculated using
the BogoMips value (the speed of this kind of busy loop is one of the
things that BogoMips measures accurately). See
<CODE>/usr/include/asm/delay.h</CODE>) for details on how it works.</P>

<H3>Delaying with port I/O</H3>

<P>Another way of delaying small numbers of microseconds is port
I/O. Inputting or outputting any byte from/to port 0x80 (see above for
how to do it) should wait for almost exactly 1 microsecond independent
of your processor type and speed. You can do this multiple times to
wait a few microseconds. The port output should have no harmful side
effects on any standard machine (and some kernel drivers use it). This
is how <CODE>{in|out}[bw]_p()</CODE> normally do the delay (see
<CODE>asm/io.h</CODE>).</P>
<P>Actually, a port I/O instruction on most ports in the 0-0x3ff range
takes almost exactly 1 microsecond, so if you're, for example, using
the parallel port directly, just do additional <CODE>inb()</CODE>s from that
port to delay.</P>

<H3>Delaying with assembler instructions</H3>

<P>If you know the processor type and clock speed of the machine the
program will be running on, you can hard-code shorter delays by
running certain assembler instructions (but remember, your process
might be scheduled out at any time, so the delays might well be longer
every now and then). For the table below, the internal processor speed
determines the number of clock cycles taken; e.g., for a 50 MHz
processor (e.g. 486DX-50 or 486DX2-50), one clock cycle takes
1/50000000 seconds (=200 nanoseconds).</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Instruction   i386 clock cycles   i486 clock cycles
xchg %bx,%bx          3                   3
nop                   3                   1
or %ax,%ax            2                   1

add %ax,0             2                   1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Clock cycles for Pentiums should be the same as for i486, except that
on Pentium Pro/II, <CODE>add %ax, 0</CODE> may take only 1/2 clock cycles. It
can sometimes be paired with another instruction (because of
out-of-order execution, this need not even be the very next
instruction in the instruction stream).</P>
<P>The instructions <CODE>nop</CODE> and <CODE>xchg</CODE> in the table should have no
side effects. The rest may modify the flags register, but this
shouldn't matter since gcc should detect it. <CODE>xchg %bx, %bx</CODE> is a
safe choice for a delay instruction.</P>
<P>To use these, call <CODE>asm(&#34;instruction&#34;)</CODE> in your
program. The syntax of the instructions is as in the table above; if
you want multiple instructions in a single <CODE>asm()</CODE> statement,
separate them with semicolons. For example,
<CODE>asm(&#34;nop ; nop ; nop ; nop&#34;)</CODE> executes four <CODE>nop</CODE>
instructions, delaying for four clock cycles on i486 or Pentium
processors (or 12 clock cycles on an i386).</P>
<P><CODE>asm()</CODE> is translated into inline assembler code by gcc, so there
is no function call overhead.</P>
<P>Shorter delays than one clock cycle are impossible in the Intel x86
architecture.</P>

<H3><CODE>rdtsc</CODE> for Pentiums</H3>

<P>For Pentiums, you can get the number of clock cycles elapsed since the
last reboot with the following C code (which executes the CPU
instrution named RDTSC):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
   extern __inline__ unsigned long long int rdtsc()
   {
     unsigned long long int x;
     __asm__ volatile (".byte 0x0f, 0x31" : "=A" (x));
     return x;
   }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can poll this value in a busy loop to delay for as many clock
cycles as you want.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Measuring time</A>
</H2>

<P>For times accurate to one second, it is probably easiest to use
<CODE>time()</CODE>. For more accurate times, <CODE>gettimeofday()</CODE> is accurate
to about a microsecond (but see above about scheduling). For Pentiums,
the <CODE>rdtsc</CODE> code fragment above is accurate to one clock cycle.</P>
<P>If you want your process to get a signal after some amount of time,
use <CODE>setitimer()</CODE> or <CODE>alarm()</CODE>. See the manual pages of the
functions for details.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Other programming languages</A></H2>

<P>The description above concentrates on the C programming language. It
should apply directly to C++ and Objective C. In assembler, you have
to call <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> or <CODE>iopl()</CODE> as in C, but after that you can
use the I/O port read/write instructions directly.</P>
<P>In other languages, unless you can insert inline assembler or C code
into the program or use the system calls mentioned above, it is
probably easiest to write a simple C source file with functions for
the I/O port accesses or delays that you need, and compile and link it
in with the rest of your program. Or use <CODE>/dev/port</CODE> as described
above.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Some useful ports</A></H2>

<P>Here is some programming information for common ports that can be directly
used for general-purpose TTL (or CMOS) logic I/O.</P>
<P>If you want to use these or other common ports for their intended
purpose (e.g., to control a normal printer or modem), you should most
likely use existing drivers (which are usually included in the kernel)
instead of programming the ports directly as this HOWTO describes.
This section is intended for those people who want to connect LCD
displays, stepper motors, or other custom electronics to a PC's
standard ports.</P>
<P>If you want to control a mass-market device like a scanner (that has
been on the market for a while), look for an existing Linux driver for
it. The 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO">Hardware-HOWTO</A> is a good place to start.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/">http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/</A> is a good source for
more information on connecting devices to computers (and on
electronics in general).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 The parallel port</A>
</H2>

<P>The parallel port's base address (called ``<CODE>BASE</CODE>'' below) is 0x3bc
for <CODE>/dev/lp0</CODE>, 0x378 for <CODE>/dev/lp1</CODE>, and 0x278 for
<CODE>/dev/lp2</CODE>. If you only want to control something that acts like
a normal printer, see the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Printing-HOWTO">Printing-HOWTO</A>.</P>
<P>In addition to the standard output-only mode described below, there is
an `extended' bidirectional mode in most parallel ports. For
information on this and the newer ECP/EPP modes (and the IEEE 1284
standard in general), see 
<A HREF="http://www.fapo.com/">http://www.fapo.com/</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.senet.com.au/~cpeacock/parallel.htm">http://www.senet.com.au/~cpeacock/parallel.htm</A>. Remember
that since you cannot use IRQs or DMA in a user-mode program, you will
probably have to write a kernel driver to use ECP/EPP; I think someone
is writing such a driver, but I don't know the details.</P>
<P>The port <CODE>BASE+0</CODE> (Data port) controls the data signals of the port (D0
to D7 for bits 0 to 7, respectively; states: 0 = low (0 V), 1 = high
(5 V)). A write to this port latches the data on the pins. A read
returns the data last written in standard or extended write mode, or
the data in the pins from another device in extended read mode.</P>
<P>The port <CODE>BASE+1</CODE> (Status port) is read-only, and returns the state
of the following input signals:
<UL>
<LI>Bits 0 and 1 are reserved.</LI>
<LI>Bit 2 IRQ status (not a pin, I don't know how this works)</LI>
<LI>Bit 3 ERROR (1=high)</LI>

<LI>Bit 5 PE (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 6 ACK (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 7 -BUSY (0=high)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The port <CODE>BASE+2</CODE> (Control port) is write-only (a read returns the
data last written), and controls the following status signals:
<UL>
<LI>Bit 0 -STROBE (0=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 1 -AUTO_FD_XT (0=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 2 INIT (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 3 -SLCT_IN (0=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 4 enables the parallel port IRQ (which occurs on the
low-to-high transition of ACK) when set to 1.</LI>
<LI>Bit 5 controls the extended mode direction (0 = write, 1 =
read), and is completely write-only (a read returns nothing
useful for this bit).</LI>
<LI>Bits 6 and 7 are reserved.</LI>
</UL>

</P>
<P>The IBM specifications say that pins 1, 14, 16, and 17 (the control
outputs) have open collector drivers pulled to 5 V through 4.7 kiloohm
resistors (sink 20 mA, source 0.55 mA, high-level output 5.0 V minus
pullup). The rest of the pins sink 24 mA, source 15 mA, and their
high-level output is min. 2.4 V. The low state for both is max. 0.5 V.
Non-IBM parallel ports probably deviate from this standard. For more
information on this, see 
<A HREF="http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/lptpower.html">http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/lptpower.html</A>.</P>
<P>Finally, a warning: Be careful with grounding. I've broken several
parallel ports by connecting to them while the computer is turned
on. It might be a good thing to use a parallel port not integrated on
the motherboard for things like this. (You can usually get a second
parallel port for your machine with a cheap standard `multi-I/O' card;
just disable the ports that you don't need, and set the parallel port
I/O address on the card to a free address. You don't need to care
about the parallel port IRQ if you don't use it.)</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 The game (joystick) port</A>
</H2>

<P>The game port is located at port addresses 0x200-0x207. If you want to
control normal joysticks, you're probably better off using the drivers
distributed with the Linux kernel.</P>
<P>Pinout (a 15-pin female D-shell connector on the port):
<UL>
<LI>1,8,9,15: +5 V (power)</LI>
<LI>4,5,12: Ground</LI>
<LI>2,7,10,14: Digital inputs BA1, BA2, BB1, and BB2, respectively</LI>
<LI>3,6,11,13: ``Analog'' inputs AX, AY, BX, and BY, respectively</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The +5 V pins seem to often be connected directly to the power lines
in the motherboard, so they may be able to source quite a lot of
power, depending on the motherboard, power supply and game port.</P>
<P>The digital inputs are used for the buttons of the two joysticks
(joystick A and joystick B, with two buttons each) that you can
connect to the port. They should be normal TTL-level inputs, and you
can read their status directly from the status port (see below). A
real joystick returns a low (0 V) status when the button is pressed
and a high (the 5 V from the power pins through an 1 Kohm resistor)
status otherwise.</P>
<P>The so-called analog inputs actually measure resistance. The game port
has a quad one-shot multivibrator (a 558 chip) connected to the four
inputs. In each input, there is a 2.2 Kohm resistor between the input
pin and the multivibrator output, and a 0.01 uF timing capacitor
between the multivibrator output and the ground. A real joystick has a
potentiometer for each axis (X and Y), wired between +5 V and the
appropriate input pin (AX or AY for joystick A, or BX or BY for
joystick B).</P>
<P>The multivibrator, when activated, sets its output lines high (5 V)
and waits for each timing capacitor to reach 3.3 V before lowering the
respective output line. Thus the high period duration of the
multivibrator is proportional to the resistance of the potentiometer
in the joystick (i.e., the position of the joystick in the appropriate
axis), as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
R = (t - 24.2) / 0.011,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

where R is the resistance (ohms) of the potentiometer and t the high
period duration (microseconds).</P>
<P>Thus, to read the analog inputs, you first activate the multivibrator
(with a port write; see below), then poll the state of the four axes
(with repeated port reads) until they drop from high to low state,
measuring their high period duration. This polling uses quite a lot of
CPU time, and on a non-realtime multitasking system like (normal
user-mode) Linux, the result is not very accurate because you cannot
poll the port constantly (unless you use a kernel-level driver and
disable interrupts while polling, but this wastes even more CPU
time). If you know that the signal is going to take a long time (tens
of ms) to go down, you can call usleep() before polling to give CPU
time to other processes.</P>
<P>The only I/O port you need to access is port 0x201 (the other ports
either behave identically or do nothing). Any write to this port (it
doesn't matter what you write) activates the multivibrator. A read
from this port returns the state of the input signals:
<UL>
<LI>Bit 0: AX (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 1: AY (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 2: BX (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 3: BY (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 4: BA1 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 5: BA2 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 6: BB1 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 7: BB2 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 The serial port</A>
</H2>

<P>If the device you're talking to supports something resembling RS-232,
you should be able to use the serial port to talk to it. The Linux
serial driver should be enough for almost all applications (you
shouldn't have to program the serial port directly, and you'd probably
have to write a kernel driver to do it); it is quite versatile, so
using non-standard bps rates and so on shouldn't be a problem.</P>
<P>See the <CODE>termios(3)</CODE> manual page, the serial driver source code

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Hints</A></H2>

<P>If you want good analog I/O, you can wire up ADC and/or DAC chips to
the parallel port (hint: for power, use the game port connector or a
spare disk drive power connector wired to outside the computer case,
unless you have a low-power device and can use the parallel port
itself for power, or use an external power supply), or buy an AD/DA
card (most of the older/slower ones are controlled by I/O ports). Or,
if you're satisfied with 1 or 2 channels, inaccuracy, and (probably)
bad zeroing, a cheap sound card supported by the Linux sound driver
should do (and it's quite fast).</P>
<P>With accurate analog devices, improper grounding may generate errors
in the analog inputs or outputs. If you experience something like
this, you could try electrically isolating your device from the
computer with optocouplers (on <EM>all</EM> signals between the computer
and your device). Try to get power for the optocouplers from the
computer (spare signals on the port may give enough power) to achieve
better isolation.</P>
<P>If you're looking for printed circuit board design software for Linux,
there is a free X11 application called Pcb that should do a nice job,
at least if you aren't doing anything very complex. It is included in
many Linux distributions, and available in 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/</A> (filename

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Troubleshooting</A></H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Q1.</B><DD>
<P>I get segmentation faults when accessing ports.</P>

<DT><B>A1.</B><DD>
<P>Either your program does not have root privileges, or the
<CODE>ioperm()</CODE> call failed for some other reason. Check the return
value of <CODE>ioperm()</CODE>. Also, check that you're actually accessing the
ports that you enabled with <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> (see Q3). If you're using
the delaying macros (<CODE>inb_p()</CODE>, <CODE>outb_p()</CODE>, and so on), remember
to call <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> to get access to port 0x80 too.</P>

<DT><B>Q2.</B><DD>
<P>I can't find the <CODE>in*()</CODE>, <CODE>out*()</CODE> functions defined
anywhere, and gcc complains about undefined references.</P>

<DT><B>A2.</B><DD>
<P>You did not compile with optimisation turned on (<CODE>-O</CODE>),
and thus gcc could not resolve the macros in <CODE>asm/io.h</CODE>. Or you
did not <CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE> at all.</P>

<DT><B>Q3.</B><DD>
<P><CODE>out*()</CODE> doesn't do anything, or does something weird.</P>

<DT><B>A3.</B><DD>
<P>Check the order of the parameters; it should be
<CODE>outb(value, port)</CODE>, not <CODE>outportb(port, value)</CODE> as is common in
MS-DOS.</P>

<DT><B>Q4.</B><DD>
<P>I want to control a standard RS-232 device/parallel
printer/joystick...</P>

<DT><B>A4.</B><DD>
<P>You're probably better off using existing drivers (in the
Linux kernel or an X server or somewhere else) to do it. The drivers
are usually quite versatile, so even slightly non-standard devices
usually work with them. See the information on standard ports above
for pointers to documentation for them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Example code</A></H2>

<P>Here's a piece of simple example code for I/O port access:</P>

/*
