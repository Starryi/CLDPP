><P
>Amateur radio is a non-profit, non-commercial activity enjoyed by
hobbyists world-wide. Radio amateurs are licensed by government
authorities to use portions of the radio spectrum allocated to them
for non-commercial, non-profit activities including personal
communication, public service, and technical experimentation. Packet
Radio is a particular digital mode of communication that makes use of
networking protocols to provide computer to computer communication.</P
><P
>This document was originally an appendix to the HAM-HOWTO, but grew too large
to be reasonably managed in that fashion. This document describes how to
install and configure the native AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE support for Linux. A
few typical configurations are described that could be used as models to work
from.</P
><P
>The Linux implementation of the amateur radio protocols is very flexible.
To people relatively unfamiliar with the Linux operating system the
configuration process may look daunting and complicated. It will take you a
little time to come to understand how the whole thing fits together. You
will find configuration very difficult if you have not properly prepared
yourself by learning about Linux in general. You cannot expect to switch
from some other environment to Linux without learning about Linux itself.</P

><P
>The <EM
>AX.25</EM
> protocol offers both connected and connectionless modes of
operation, and is used either by itself for point-point links, or to carry
other protocols such as TCP/IP and NET/ROM.</P
><P
>It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to make it
more useful in the amateur radio environment.</P
><P
>The NET/ROM protocol is an attempt at a full network protocol and uses AX.25 at
its lowest layer as a datalink protocol. It provides a network layer that is
an adapted form of AX.25. The NET/ROM protocol features dynamic routing and
node aliases.</P
><P
>The ROSE protocol was conceived and first implemented by Tom Moulton W2VY and
is an implementation of the X.25 packet layer protocol and is designed to
operate with AX.25 as its datalink layer protocol. It too provides a network
layer. ROSE addresses take the form of 10 digit numbers. The first four digits
are called the Data Network Identification Code (DNIC) and are taken from
Appendix B of the CCITT X.121 recommendation. More information on the ROSE
protocol may be obtained from the
<A

>.</P

>Alan Cox developed some early kernel based AX.25 software support for
Linux. <A
HREF="mailto:g4klx@g4klx.demon.co.uk"
TARGET="_top"
>Jonathon
Naylor</A
> has taken up ongoing development of the code, has added
NET/ROM and ROSE support and is now the developer of the AX.25 related
kernel code. DAMA support was developed by
<A
HREF="mailto:jreuter@poboxes.com"

>Joerg</A
>, DL1BKE. Baycom and
Soundmodem support were added by 
<A
HREF="mailto:sailer@ife.ee.ethz.ch"
TARGET="_top"
>Thomas Sailer</A
>.
The AX.25 software is now maintained by a small team of developers
on <A
HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>SourceForge</A
>.</P
><P
>The Linux code supports KISS and 6PACK based TNC's (Terminal Node
Controllers), the Ottawa PI card, the Gracilis PacketTwin card and
other Z8530 SCC based cards with the generic SCC driver, several
parallel and serial port Baycom modems, and serial port YAM
modems. Thomas Sailer's kernel soundmodem driver supports SoundBlaster
and sound cards based on the Crystal chip set, and his newer user-mode
soundmodem uses the standard kernel sound drivers, so it should work
with any sound card supported under Linux.</P
><P
>The user programs contain a simple PMS (Personal Message System), a
beacon facility, a line mode connect program,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>listen</TT
> (an example of how to capture all AX.25
frames at raw interface level), and programs to configure the NET/ROM
protocol. Also included are an AX.25 server style program to handle
and dispatch incoming AX.25 connections and a NET/ROM daemon which
does most of the hard work for NET/ROM support.</P

>There are utility programs to support APRS, including digipeating and
gatewaying to the Internet.</P

ways it may looks similar to NOS, or BPQ or other AX.25 implementations, it
is none of these and is not identical to any of them. The Linux AX.25
implementation is capable of being configured to behave almost identically
to other implementations, but the configuration process is very different.</P

>This diagram is a little more general than the first. This diagram attempts to
show the relationship between user applications, the kernel and the hardware.
It also shows the relationship between the Socket application programming
interface, the actual protocol modules, the kernel networking devices and the
device drivers. Anything in this diagram is dependent on anything underneath
it, and in general you must configure from the bottom of the diagram upwards.
So for example, if you want to run the <EM
>call</EM
> program you must also
configure the hardware, then ensure that the kernel has the appropriate device
driver, that you create the appropriate network device, that the kernel
includes the desired protocol that presents a programming interface that the
<EM
>call</EM
> program can use. I have attempted to lay out this document in
roughly that order.</P

><P
>The <EM
>mkiss</EM
> utility included in the ax25-utils
distribution allows you to make use of both modems on a dual port
TNC. Configuration is fairly simple. It works by taking a single
serial device connected to a single multiport TNC and making it look
like a number of devices each connected to a single port TNC. You do
this <EM
>before</EM
> you do any of the AX.25
configuration. The devices that you then do the AX.25 configuration on
are pseudo-TTY interfaces, (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ttyq*</TT
>), and not
the actual serial device. Pseudo-TTY devices create a kind of pipe
through which programs designed to talk to tty devices can talk to
other programs designed to talk to tty devices. Each pipe has a master
and a slave end. The master end is generally called
`<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ptyq*</TT
>' and the slave ends are called
`<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ttyq*</TT
>'. There is a one to one relationship
between masters and slaves, so <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ptyq0</TT
> is the
master end of a pipe with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ttyq0</TT
> as its
slave. You must open the master end of a pipe before opening the slave
end. <EM
>mkiss</EM
> exploits this mechanism to split a
single serial device into separate devices.</P

information about the modems themselves may be obtained from the

><P
>Your first step should be to determine the i/o and addresses of the
serial or parallel port(s) you have Baycom modem(s) connected to.
When you have these you must configure the Baycom driver with them.</P

>The Baycom driver creates network devices called:
<TT

etc. when it is configured.</P
><P

driver with these parameters, or, if you have only one Baycom modem
installed you may specify the parameters on the

module.</P

>Thomas Sailer has built a driver for the kernel that allows you to
use your soundcard as a modem. Connect your radio directly to your
soundcard to play packet! Thomas recommends at least a 486DX2/66 if you
want to use this software as all of the digital signal processing is done
by the main CPU.</P
><P
>The driver currently emulates 1200 bps AFSK, 4800 HAPN and 9600 FSK (G3RUH
compatible) modem types. The only sound cards currently supported are
SoundBlaster and Windows Sound System Compatible models. If you have a sound
card of another type, you can try the user-mode soundmodem described later
in this document.</P
><P
>The sound cards require some circuitry to help them drive the
Push-To-Talk circuitry, and information on this is available from
<A
HREF="http://www.baycom.org/~tom/pcf/ptt_circ/ptt.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Thomas's
Soundmodem PTT circuit web page</A
>. There are quite a few
possible options, they are: detect the sound output from the
soundcard, or use output from a parallel port, serial port or MIDI
port. Circuit examples for each of these are on Thomas's site.</P

<TT

>The NET/ROM protocol relies on, and uses the AX.25 ports you have created.
The NET/ROM protocol rides on top of the AX.25 protocol. To configure NET/ROM
on an AX.25 interface you must configure two files. One file describes the
NET/ROM interfaces, and the other file describes which of the AX.25 ports
will carry NET/ROM. You can configure multiple NET/ROM ports, each with its
own callsign and alias, the same procedure applies for each.</P

a Linux machine would have only one NET/ROM device configured that would

>12. Configuring Linux to accept Packet connections</A
></H2
><P
>Linux is a powerful operating system and offers a great deal of flexibility
in how it is configured. With this flexibility comes a cost in configuring
it to do what you want. When configuring your Linux machine to accept incoming
AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE connections there are a number of questions you need to
ask yourself. The most important of which is: "What do I want users to see when
they connect?". People are developing neat little applications that may be
used to provide services to callers, a simple example is the <EM
>pms</EM
> program
included in the AX.25 utilities, a more complex example is the <EM
>node</EM
> program
also included in the AX.25 utilities. Alternatively you might want to give
users a login prompt so that they can make use of a shell account, or you
might even have written your own program, such as a customized database or a
game, that you want people to connect to. Whatever you choose, you must tell
the AX.25 software about this so that it knows what software to run when it
accepts an incoming AX.25 connection.</P
><P
>The <EM
>ax25d</EM
> program is similar to the <EM
>inetd</EM
> program commonly used
to accept incoming TCP/IP connections on UNIX machines. It sits and listens
for incoming connections, when it detects one it goes away and checks a
configuration file to determine what program to run and connect to that
connection. Since this the standard tool for accepting incoming AX.25, NET/ROM
and ROSE connections I'll describe how to configure it.</P

this way you may create groups of default configurations. It is
important to note that the `<TT

not allow you to set the `<TT

There is one small thing you need to think about though. Dave has added command
line arguments to the PMS to allow it to handle a number of different text
end-of-line conventions. AX.25 and NET/ROM by convention expect the end-of-line
to be <EM
>carriage return, linefeed</EM
> while the standard UNIX end-of-line is
just <EM
>newline</EM
>. So, for example, if you wanted to add an entry that
meant that the default action for a connection received on an AX.25 port is
to start the PMS then you would add a line that looked something like:</P

similar ways. One amateur has used this utility to make connections to a
remote BBS easier. Normally the users would have to manually enter a long

>There are a number of situations where it is highly desirable to associate
a callsign with a linux user account. One example might be where a number of
amateur radio operators share the same linux machine and wish to use their
own callsign when making calls. Another is the case of PMS users wanting to
talk to a particular user on your machine.</P

user account names with callsigns. We've mentioned it once already in the PMS

>In any case, the tunnel must be set up on both sides of the route.
The tunnelling interface configured above is used for both
encapsulation and decapsulation. However, the same principle can be
used for one of those tasks, exclusively. When needed, the standard
routing (via UCSD), used in previous example, can be avoided by
setting the IPIP tunneling between two PR stations, where only one of
them has its own internet (public) non-ampr IP address. The task is
then to set up the one-way IPIP tunnel, to achieve a quicker and more
stable route from non-ampr IP address to ampr IP address station. In
this case, the setup, mentioned above, is used for encapsulation. The
other side of the route can leave out the route setting, due to its
pure decapsulation task.</P

addition to tcp/ip. Encapsulation of AX.25 frames within IP datagrams is
described in RFC-1226 by Brian Kantor. Mike Westerhof wrote an implementation
of an AX.25 encapsulation daemon for UNIX in 1991. The ax25-utils package
includes a marginally enhanced version of it for Linux.</P

>An AXIP encapsulation program accepts AX.25 frames at one end, looks at the
destination AX.25 address to determine what IP address to send them to,
encapsulates them in a tcp/ip datagram and then transmits them to
the appropriate remote destination. It also accepts tcp/ip datagrams
that contain AX.25 frames, unwraps them and processes them as if it had
received them directly from an AX.25 port. To distinguish IP datagrams
containing AX.25 frames from other IP datagrams which don't, AXIP datagrams
are coded with a protocol id of 4 (or 94 which is now deprecated). This
process is described in RFC-1226.</P

><P
>The <EM
>ax25ipd</EM
> program has two major modes of operation. "digipeater"
mode and "tnc" mode. In "tnc" mode the daemon is treated as though it
were a kiss TNC, you pass KISS encapsulated frames to it and it will
transmit them, this is the usual configuration. In "digipeater" mode, you
treat the daemon as though it were an AX.25 digipeater. There are subtle
differences between these modes.</P
><P
>In the configuration file you configure "routes" or mappings between
destination AX.25 callsigns and the IP addresses of the hosts that you
want to send the AX.25 packets too. Each route has options which will be
explained later.</P

>Other options that are configured here are:

><P
>whether you want to encapsulate the AX.25 frames in IP datagrams or in
UDP/IP datagrams. Nearly all AXIP gateways use IP encapsulation, but some
gateways are behind firewalls that will not allow IP with the AXIP protocol id
to pass and are forced to use UDP/IP. Whatever you choose must match
what the tcp/ip host at the other end of the link is using.</P

></H4
><P
>The "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>route</TT
>" command is where you specify where you want your AX.25
packets encapsulated and sent to. When the <EM
>ax25ipd</EM

a packet from its interface, it compares the destination callsign with each
of the callsigns in its routing table. If it finds a match then the ax.25
packet is encapsulated in an IP datagram and then transmitted to the host
at the specified IP address.</P
><P
>There are two flags you can add to any of the route commands in the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ax25ipd.conf</TT

<P

>22.4. Linking NOS and Linux using a pipe device</A
></H3
><P
>Many people like to run some version of NOS under Linux because it has
all of the features and facilities they are used to. Most of those people
would also like to have the NOS running on their machine capable of talking
to the Linux kernel so that they can offer some of the linux capabilities
to radio users via NOS.</P
><P
>Brandon S. Allbery, KF8NH, contributed the following information to explain
how to interconnect the NOS running on a Linux machine with the kernel
code using the Linux pipe device.</P
><P
>Since both Linux and NOS support the slip protocol it is possible to link
the two together by creating a slip link. You could do this by using two
serial ports with a loopback cable between them, but this would be slow
and costly. Linux provides a feature that many other Unix-like operating
systems provide called `pipes'. These are special pseudo devices that
look like a standard tty device to software but in fact loopback to another
pipe device. To use these pipes the first program must open the <EM
>master</EM
>
end of the pipe, and the open then the second program can open the
<EM
>slave</EM
> end of the pipe. When both ends are open the programs can
communicate with each other simply by writing characters to the pipes in the
way they would if they were terminal devices.</P
><P
>To use this feature to connect the Linux Kernel and a copy of NOS, or some
other program you first must choose a pipe device to use. You can find one
by looking in your <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev</TT
> directory. The master end of the pipes are
named: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ptyq[1-f]</TT
> and the slave end of the pipes are known as:
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ttyq[1-f]</TT
>. Remember they come in pairs, so if you select
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ptyqf</TT
> as your master end then you must use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ttyqf</TT
>
as the slave end.</P
><P
>Once you have chosen a pipe device pair to use you should allocate the master
end to you linux kernel and the slave end to the NOS program, as the Linux
kernel starts first and the master end of the pipe must be opened first.
You must also remember that your Linux kernel must have a different IP address
to your NOS, so you will need to allocate a unique address for it if you
haven't already.</P
><P
>You configure the pipe just as if it were a serial device, so to create
the slip link from your linux kernel you can use commands similar to the
following:</P

>In this example the Linux kernel has been given IP address <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>44.70.4.88</TT
>
and the NOS program is using IP address <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>44.70.248.67</TT
>. The
<EM
>route</EM
> command in the last line simply tells your linux kernel to route
all datagrams for the amprnet via the slip link created by the
<EM
>slattach</EM
> command. Normally you would put these commands into your
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</TT
> file after all your other network configuration
is complete so that the slip link is created automatically when you reboot.
Note: there is no advantage in using <EM
>cslip</EM
> instead of <EM
>slip</EM
>
as it actually reduces performance because the link is only a virtual
one and occurs fast enough that having to compress the headers first takes
longer than transmitting the uncompressed datagram.</P
><P
>To configure the NOS end of the link you could try the following:</P

><P
>These commands will create a slip port named `linux' via the slave end of
the pipe device pair to your linux kernel, and a route to it to make it
work. When you have started NOS you should be able to ping and telnet to
your NOS from your Linux machine and vice versa. If not, double check that
you have made no mistakes especially that you have the addresses configured
properly and have the pipe devices around the right way.</P
