<H1>mini-HOWTO install qmail with MH</H1>

<H2>Christopher Richardson (rdn@tara.n.eunet.de)</H2>v1.4, 5 March 1998
<HR>
<EM>I am just documenting my installation experiences to offer some help to
other users who wish to use the above combination for their email.
v1.4 - I have finally got a new Linux box running so I decided to
update this mini-howto</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P> </P>
<P>My thanks to all netizens who have helped me, especially Tony Nugent
(tony@trishul.sci.gu.edu.au), David Summers (david@summersoft.fay.ar.us)
and S.u.S.E ( Linux distribution) who has made installing Linux so much easier,
and the authors of the above excellent programs.</P>
<P>What is qmail and why should I use it?  Here is the author´s (Dan Bernstein)
blurb:</P>
<P>qmail is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message transfer agent.
It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts.</P>
<P>Secure: Security isn't just a goal, but an absolute requirement. Mail
delivery is critical for users; it cannot be turned off, so it must be
completely secure. (This is why I started writing qmail: I was sick of
the security holes in sendmail and other MTAs.)</P>
<P>Reliable: qmail's straight-paper-path philosophy guarantees that a
message, once accepted into the system, will never be lost. qmail also
supports maildir, a new, super-reliable user mailbox format. Maildirs,
unlike mbox files and mh folders, won't be corrupted if the system
crashes during delivery. Even better, not only can a user safely read
his mail over NFS, but any number of NFS clients can deliver mail to him
at the same time.</P>
<P>Efficient: On a Pentium under BSD/OS, qmail can easily sustain 200000
local messages per day---that's separate messages injected and delivered
to mailboxes in a real test! Although remote deliveries are inherently
limited by the slowness of DNS and SMTP, qmail overlaps 20 simultaneous
deliveries by default, so it zooms quickly through mailing lists. (This
is why I finished qmail: I had to get a big mailing list set up.)</P>
<P>Simple: qmail is vastly smaller than any other Internet MTA. Some
reasons why: (1) Other MTAs have separate forwarding, aliasing, and
mailing list mechanisms. qmail has one simple forwarding mechanism that
lets users handle their own mailing lists. (2) Other MTAs offer a
spectrum of delivery modes, from fast+unsafe to slow+queued. qmail-send
is instantly triggered by new items in the queue, so the qmail system
has just one delivery mode: fast+queued. (3) Other MTAs include, in
effect, a specialized version of inetd that watches the load average.
qmail's design inherently limits the machine load, so qmail-smtpd can
safely run from your system's inetd.</P>
<P>Replacement for sendmail: qmail supports host and user masquerading,
full host hiding, virtual domains, null clients, list-owner rewriting,
relay control, double-bounce recording, arbitrary RFC 822 address lists,
cross-host mailing list loop detection, per-recipient checkpointing,
downed host backoffs, independent message retry schedules, etc. In
short, it's up to speed on modern MTA features. qmail also includes a
drop-in ``sendmail'' wrapper so that it will be used transparently by
your current UAs.</P>

<P>Dan Bernstein has provided a package for sending queued email to an ISP

       maildir2smtp - blast a maildir across SMTP

       maildir2smtp is designed to pass messages along a SLIP  or
       PPP  link.  To set this up on the disconnected end, create
       a new maildir in alias:

          # maildirmake ~alias/pppdir
          # chown -R alias ~alias/pppdir

       Put

          :alias-ppp

       into control/virtualdomains and

          ./pppdir/

       into ~alias/.qmail-ppp-default.  Don't  forget  the  extra
       slash in pppdir/.  Then, in the PPP startup script, do

          maildir2smtp ~alias/pppdir alias-ppp- $IP `hostname`

       replacing  $IP with the remote IP address.

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Notes:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Please read the Fine manual page completely.
</LI>
<LI>Maildir2smtp requires the dotted IP address of your mail server. If you do not have this then ping YourMail.host.country which will return the IP.
</LI>
<LI>This command can be included in your login script to flush all queued mail after logging in to your ISP.

<P>Notes:
<UL>
<LI>I have only compiled ``mts sendmail'' - read in comp.mail.mh somewhere that /smtp can cause problems. Dominic Mitchell (hdm@demon.net) wrote in comp.mail.mh (13 June 1997):

``Not quite. With this option MH still talks SMTP, just over a pipe
and not over a network. You *really* need a line in your &nbsp;/.mh_profile
which says:

postproc: /usr/local/nmh/lib/spost

Or whever it's kept on your system. This will pass the message
directly to sendmail in the traditional manner. You're using
qmail of course, so sendmail will be qmail's wrapper script, but that's
just fine.'' Thanks Dominic.
