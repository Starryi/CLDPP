provided by your vendor.  Assuming that this includes support for
your driver, and assuming that your vendor shipped the driver for
your printer, then it should be easy to get a basic setup going
this way.  For information on vendor-provided setup tools, see <a class="xref" href="ar01s09.html" title="9. Vendor Solutions">Section 9, &#8220;Vendor Solutions&#8221;</a>.</p><p>If your vendor's tool doesn't work out, you should
figure out if your printer is supposed to work at all.  Consult the
printer compatibility listings in <a class="xref" href="ar01s05.html#printer-compat-list" title="5.3.1. Printer compatibility list">Section 5.3.1, &#8220;Printer compatibility list&#8221;</a> as well as the online version
described there.</p><p>If your printer is known to work with a driver, check that you have
that driver, and install if it not.  Typically you will be able to
find a contributed Ghostscript package including newer Ghostscript
code and assorted third-party drivers.  If not, you can compile it
yourself; the process is not trivial, but it is well documented.
See <a class="xref" href="ar01s10.html" title="10. Ghostscript.">Section 10, &#8220;Ghostscript.&#8221;</a> for more information on
Ghostscript.</p><p>After installing the proper driver, attempt again to configure your
printer with your vendor's tools.  If that fails, select a
suitable third party tool from those described in <a class="xref" href="ar01s08.html" title="8. How to set things up">Section 8, &#8220;How to set things up&#8221;</a>. If that also fails, you'll need to construct
your own setup; again see <a class="xref" href="ar01s08.html" title="8. How to set things up">Section 8, &#8220;How to set things up&#8221;</a>.</p><p>If you're still stuck, you've got a little troubleshooting to do.
It's probably best to read most of this document first to get a
feel for how things are supposed to work; then you'll be in a
better position to debug.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="getting-help"></a>2.1. Where to Get Help</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="idm92"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm95"></a><p>The Usenet newsgroups comp.os.linux.hardware, comp.os.linux.setup,
