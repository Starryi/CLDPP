new works.  It is worth knowing, though, that you can typeset
a man page directly into postscript with groff.  Most man

TeX's output format is <code class="filename">dvi</code>, and is
converted to PostScript or Hewlett Packard's PCL with <span class="command"><strong>dvips</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>dvilj</strong></span>.  If you
wish to install TeX or LaTeX, install the whole teTeX group of
packages; it contains everything.  Recent TeX installations
include pdfTeX and pdfLaTeX, which produce Adobe PDF files
directly.  Commands are available do create hyperlinks and
navigation features in the PDF file.</p><div class="figure"><a name="latex-example"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 13. Example of LaTeX Input</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
\subsubsection{NAT}

Each real server is assigned a different IP address, and the NA
implements address translation for all inbound and outbound
packets.

  \begin{description}
  \item[Advantage] Implementation simplicity, especially if we
already implement other NAT capabilities.

  \item[Disadvantage] Return traffic from the server goes through
address translation, which may incur a speed penalty.  This
probably isn't too bad if we design for it from the
beginning.

  \item[Disadvantage] NAT breaks the end-to-end semantics of normal
internet traffic.  Protocols like ftp, H.323, etc would
require special support involving snooping and in-stream
rewriting, or complete protocol proxying; neither is likely
to be practical.
