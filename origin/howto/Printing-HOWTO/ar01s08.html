documentation.  Most GNU/Linux distributions supply one or more
   "idiot-proof" tools to do everything described here for common
printers.</p><p>If your vendor's tool doesn't work out for you, or you'd like the
ability to interactively control printing options when you print,
then you should use some other system. APS Filter
is another good system; it configures LPD queues and filters very
easily on most any sort of Unix system.</p><p>You can also use the printing system interfaces from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/" target="_top">linuxprinting.org website</a>
to connect many free drivers into several spooling systems. Once
this project is complete, these interfaces will offer the best
functionality: all styles of free software drivers are supported,
user-settable options are available, and most common spooling
systems are supported. Currently the foomatic print system is used in most modern distributions anyway. However, your distro may include a slightly outdated version of foomatic.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cups-config-tutorial"></a>8.1. Configuring CUPS</h3></div></div></div><p>If you are using a client with CUPS and a CUPS server has already been configured, installing the printers on your client can not get much easier than this: do nothing. Through broadcasting, the client should find the CUPS server and automatically configure the printers that are installed on that print server. This is one of the features of CUPS that will be really appreciated on large networks.</p><p>Manually configuring printers with CUPS, also is a peace of cake. If you are new to CUPS and/or Unix printing, the way to go is probably the web interface. If you have to configure lots of printers, using the command-line will probably be faster.</p><p>The URL to access the CUPS web interface is http://hostname:631/admin by default. The port can be changed in cupsd.conf if necessary.</p><p>To add a printer from the command-line the general syntax is
<span class="command"><strong>lpadmin -p printer -E -v device -m ppd</strong></span>
Lpadmin with the -p option adds or modifies a printer. The printers are saved in the file
The -x option deletes the named printer. Read the lpadmin man page for available options.

This section describes a very
basic setup for LPD; further sections detail the creation of
complex filters and network configuration.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="basic-lpd-configuration"></a>8.2.1. Basic LPD configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>The minimal setup for lpd results in a system that can queue
files and print them.  It will not pay any attention to whether or
not your printer will understand them, and will probably not let
you produce attractive output.  But we have to start somewhere.</p><p>To add a print queue to lpd, you must add an entry in<code class="filename">/etc/printcap</code>, and make the new spool
directory under <code class="filename">/var/spool/lpd</code>.</p><p>An entry in <code class="filename">/etc/printcap</code> looks like:</p><pre class="programlisting">
# LOCAL djet500
lp|dj|deskjet:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/dj:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lp=/dev/lp0:\
        :sh:
</pre><p>
This defines a spool called <span class="emphasis"><em>lp</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>dj</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>deskjet</em></span>, spooled
in the directory <code class="filename">/var/spool/lpd/dj</code>, with no
per-job maximum size limit, which prints to the device<code class="filename">/dev/lp0</code>, and which does not have a banner
page (with the name of the person who printed, etc) added to the
front of the print job.</p><p>Go now and read the man page for <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code><a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/man/printcap.5.html" target="_top">printcap</a></code></em></code>.</p><p>The above looks very simple, but there a catch - unless I send in
files a DeskJet 500 can understand, this DeskJet will print
strange things.  For example, sending an ordinary Unix text file
to a deskjet results in literally interpreted newlines, and gets
me:</p><pre class="screen">
This is line one.
	This is line two.
		This is line three.</pre><p>
ad nauseam.  Printing a PostScript file to this spool would get a
beautiful listing of the PostScript commands, printed out with
this "staircase effect", but no useful output.</p><p><a name="lpd-filtering-example"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="idm1349"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="idm1352"></a>Clearly more is needed, and this is the purpose of filtering.
The more observant of you who read the printcap man page might
have noticed the spool attributes <code class="option">if</code> and<code class="option">of</code>.  Well, <code class="option">if</code>, or the
input filter, is just what we need here.</p><p>If we write a small shell script called <span class="command"><strong>filter</strong></span>
that adds carriage returns before newlines, the staircasing can
be eliminated.  So we have to add in an <code class="option">if</code>
line to our printcap entry above:</p><pre class="programlisting">
lp|dj|deskjet:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/dj:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lp=/dev/lp0:\
        :if=/var/spool/lpd/dj/filter:\
        :sh:
</pre><p>
A simple filter script might be:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#!perl
# The above line should really have the whole path to perl
# This script must be executable: chmod 755 filter
while(&lt;STDIN&gt;){chomp $_; print "$_\r\n";};
# You might also want to end with a form feed: print "\f";
</pre><p>
If we were to do the above, we'd have a spool to which we could
print regular Unix text files and get meaningful results.  (Yes,
there are four million better ways to write this filter, but few
so illustrative.  You are encouraged to do this more
efficiently.)</p><p>The only remaining problem is that printing plain text is really
not too hot - surely it would be better to be able to print
PostScript and other formatted or graphic types of output.  Well,
yes, it would, and it's easy to do.  The method is simply an
extension of the above linefeed-fixing filter.</p><p>Such a filter is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>magic</em></span> filter. Don't bother
writing one yourself unless you print strange things - there are
a good many written for you already, and most have easy-to-use
interactive configuration tools.  You should simply select a
suitable pre-written filter:</p><div class="variablelist"><a name="lpd-filters-available-now"></a><p class="title"><b><a class="indexterm" name="idm1369"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1372"></a></b></p><dl class="variablelist"><dt><a name="lpdomatic-filter-available"></a><span class="term">foomatic-rip<a class="indexterm" name="idm1377"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1380"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1383"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1385"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1388"></a></span></dt><dd><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/lpd-doc.html" target="_top">foomatic-rip</a> is a filter designed to use data from the

It shipped beginning, I think, in version 4 of Red Hat Linux,
as the backend to the easy-to-use <span class="command"><strong>printtool</strong></span> GUI printer configuration tool.
</p><p>The rhs filter system is built on an ASCII database listing
distributed with it.  This listing supports many Ghostscript
and Uniprint drivers, but not filter-style drivers.  The
filters constructed also do not support much in the way of
user-controllable options at print time.</p><p>
The <span class="command"><strong>printtool</strong></span> places a configuration file
named <code class="filename">postscript.cfg</code> in the spool
directory.  Inside this Bourne shell-style file, each setting
is a variable.  In unusual cases, you can make useful changes
directly to the config file which the printtool won't allow;
typically this would be the specification of an unusual
Ghostscript driver, or a PPD filename for the VA
rhs-printfilters version.</p><p>
VA Linux has made some enhancements to the rhs-printfilters
system under contract from HP.  With the proper versions, it
is possible to select options for Postscript printers
under control of Adobe PPD files.  I cover this system in<a class="xref" href="ar01s08.html#lpd-for-postscript-printers" title="8.2.2. LPD for PostScript Printers">Section 8.2.2, &#8220;LPD for PostScript Printers&#8221;</a>.</p></dd></dl></div><p>There's one catch to such filters: older version of lpd don't run
the <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> filter for remote printers, while
most newer ones do (although often with no arguments).  The
version of LPD shipped with modern GNU/Linux and FreeBSD
distributions does; most commercial Unices that still ship LPD
have a version that does not.  See the section on network
printing later in this document for more information on this.  If
you only have locally-connected printers, then this won't affect
you.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="lpd-for-postscript-printers"></a>8.2.2. LPD for PostScript Printers</h4></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="idm1430"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1433"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1436"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1439"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1442"></a><p>While most versions of LPD don't gracefully handle PostScript
     (never mind user options), VA Linux modified LPD and Red

files.  PPD files are provided by printer manufacturers and
declare the available options on a printer, along with the
Postscript code needed to activate them.  With the VA system,
the normal LPD scheme works a little differently:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>The user can specify options with the <code class="option">-o</code>

MediaType:Transparency</code> if you were about to print on
overhead film.  Alternatively, the front-end <a class="ulink" href="http://www.compumetric.com/linux.html" target="_top">GPR</a> can
be used to specify options in a dialog box; you can see

micro-HOWTO</a>.   In essence, you need to uninstall the Red
Hat version of printtool, lpd, and rhs-printfilters entirely,
and then install the VA versions, plus ppdfilt, gpr, and a few
other utilities.</p><p>You will also need PPD files for your Postscript printers.
PPD files are usually fairly easy to find.  VA Linux and HP
distribute PPD files for many Laserjet models.  Other vendors
provide PPDs for their own printers, and Adobe distributes <a class="ulink" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html" target="_top">PPD files</a> for many printers.</p><p>At the moment, much of this is a bit difficult to install.  But
future installation tools will build upon the printer

enables both the autodetection and rhs-printfilter configuration
of both networked and local printers.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It is possible to use GPR alone, without the modified LPD

option.  You may specify any option/value pair from your
printer's PPD file with <code class="option">-o</code>.  For example,
consider this PPD file option clause:</p><pre class="programlisting">
*OpenUI *PrintQuality/Print Quality: PickOne
*DefaultPrintQuality: None
*OrderDependency: 150 AnySetup *PrintQuality
*PrintQuality None/Printer Setting: ""

*CloseUI: *PrintQuality
</pre><p>
For the option <code class="option">PrintQuality</code>, the possible
values are <code class="option">Quick</code>, <code class="option">Normal</code>,<code class="option">Pres</code>, or <code class="option">Image</code>.  You might
give a command like:</p><pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">%</code> <span class="command"><strong>lpr</strong></span> <code class="option">-o PrintQuality:Image</code> <code class="option">file.ps</code></pre><p>

will work in addition to the ones from your PPD.  These
include:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">page-ranges</code></span></dt><dd><p>You can specify a range of pages to print.

point or a nearly complete solution, depending on your needs.
Medium to large environments can be well supported by native LPRng
features.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Each printer should have a single point of control, where an
administrator can pause, reorder, or redirect the queue.  To
implement this, have everyone printing to a local server,
which will then queue jobs and direct them to the proper
printer.  For large campuses or distributed networks, have one
server per building or other suitable network subset.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use CUPS or LPRng, at least on servers; the BSD LPD is too buggy for
       "real" use. But don't take my word for it&#8212;you should test a number of
spoolers and see which suits you best.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Client systems should not have unique printing configurations. CUPS provides automatic client configuration of printers on the same subnet. You can even configure CUPS (BrowsePoll) to poll servers on other subnets for available printers. These features limit the amount of configuration that needs to take place at the client.
To implement a uniform printing configuration with LPRng, use LPRng's extended printcap syntax so
that you have one printcap to use everywhere.  CEPS provides
for this by building atop a lightweight distributed database
instead of traditional printcap files.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Print queues should not be named for make or model; name print
queues for something sensible like location (floor2_nw)

printer, including location, capabilities, etc.  Consider
having it show the queue and include a button to remove jobs
from the queue.  Complex networked environments are
unmanageable for users without proper documentation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>On Windows and Apple systems, use either the platform-specific

as an argument to your <code class="option">if</code> filter.  It's up to you
to make your <code class="option">if</code> filter write entries to the
accounting file, and up to you to process the accounting file
later (the traditional format is mainly useful for line printers,
and is nontrivial to parse in Perl, so there's no reason to
preserve it).  Also, if you're using <span class="command"><strong>foomatic-rip</strong></span> program as your filter, you'll need
to make changes, since it depends on being given a configuration
file as the ``accounting'' file name.</p><p>CUPS provides page accounting by passing jobs through the pstops filter. This filter expects Postscript input. If you use print "raw" jobs, this is always counted as 1 page. This means that accounting will not work, if you print from Windows client with the native printer driver.</p><p><a name="gs-accounting"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="idm1582"></a>Ghostscript provides a PageCount operator that you can use to

accounting file entry; for the best example of this see the file<code class="filename">unix-lpr.sh</code> in the Ghostscript source
distribution.</p><p>Note that the <span class="command"><strong>unix-lpr</strong></span> implementation of
accounting writes to a file from the Ghostscript interpreter, and
is thus incompatible with the recommended -dSAFER option.  A
better solution might be to query the printer with a PJL command
after each job, or to write a postscript snippet that prints the
pagecount on stdout, where it can be captured without having to
write to a file.</p><p><a name="lprng-accounting"></a>
