>    This document describes the basic concepts behind using XDM
    (the X Display Manager) to manage X terminals and X servers,
    in order to provide 'thin-client' computing, using Linux.
    </P
><P
>    X (or the 'X Window System') is the windowing and graphics environment
    of choice for Unix systems.  Its particular strength (and the key bit
    that we are interested in for this document) is that it separates the
    running applications (web browser, word processor, etc) from the actual
    graphics screen and input devices (mouse, keyboard, etc) via a network
    communications mechanism.
    </P
><P
>    Essentially, this means that you can be running
    an application on one machine, but have its input and output redirected
    to another machine via a network.  This is the key feature that makes
    an X terminal possible.
    </P
><P
>    This document should be treated as a 'getting started with XDM' document,
    in that it describes the basic terms and concepts for using XDM and
    X terminals, with simple examples that provide the minimum amount of
    security.
    </P
><P
>    The reader is advised to consult the list of resources provided at
    the end of the document in order to proceed beyond these basic
    facilities - in particular, the configuration of the 'authentication'
    and security settings should be examined, as the examples given in
    this document utilise the least secure modes of operation.
    </P
><P
>    Please note - the majority of the information in this document was obtained from
    systems running Debian 2.1, SuSE 6.4, Mandrake 7.0 and RedHat 6.0.

    configuration of a network or X on Linux.  Please refer to the
    appropriate HOWTO documents from the Linux Documentation Project for
    details (see <A

    </P

></H3
><P
>    This document came about because I wanted to experiment with Linux
    on a 486 PC as an X terminal to my main Linux box.
    </P
><P
>    After reading the man pages, specifications and current howto documents
    relating to XDM and X terminals, I ended up getting really confused
    about where XDM was supposed to run and confusing XDM servers with
    X servers and the like, and so after an evening or two of
    experimentation, this document was born.
    </P
><P
>    Once the basic terminology has been sorted out, the documentation
    for XDM and self-documenting sample files make very good reading
    - I just could not find a simple introduction to the basic concepts
    anywhere to get me started.  Hopefully this document could prove
    to be a suitable introduction to someone in a similar position to
    me.
    </P

>    Oh, and in case you are wondering, a 486dx2/66 with 16 Mb RAM
    makes a fine X terminal!

></H3
><P
>    Put simply, XDM (the X Display Manager) can be thought of as a graphical
    replacement for the command line 'login' prompt.  In reality, it can
    actually do much more than that.
    </P
><P
>    Typically, it would be started by the 'root' user (or the system startup
    scripts) on power up, and would present a user with a graphical login
    prompt.  It will then manage the users X session once they login -
    i.e. it will initiate the running of their window manager and applications.
    </P
><P
>    This could be considered a typical 'simple local machine login'
    configuration, as may be found installed by many Linux distributions
    by default.  However, XDM can also manage remote X servers and provide
    login prompts to remote 'X terminals'.  In short, it is not limited to
    the local machine - it can easily manage other machines connected via
    a network.
    </P
><P
>    XDM is a very configurable utility and this document will only just
    'scratch the surface' of what may be achieved.  This document aims to
    provide enough information to configure your X terminals and application
    servers to connect to each other.  The reader is referred to 
    <A
HREF="#RESOURCES"
>Section 7</A
> for further information on the topics
    discussed here.
    </P
><P
>    A note on security: X (in its default configuration) and XDMCP are not
    particularly secure.  I am assuming that you are running X on a
    'trusted' network and that security is not an issue.
    For details of how to tighten up your X connections
    (and more details about using the networking capabilities of X) please
    refer to the 'Running Remote X Applications' Howto document, which is
    also part of the LDP (see <A

>        This would be a machine with no local disks, that would perform its
        boot up from an EPROM (or similar) and utilises a network connection to a
        server.  It would obtain its
        network configuration, operating system, system configuration and all
        applications from the server.  Once booted however, this
        would be the same as a 'dumb X terminal' (see below).  Typically this
        configuration would use a combination of the following network protocols
        in order to boot: BOOTP, DHCP, TFTP, etc.  Refer to
        <A

        system, and starts the 'X server' program and nothing more.  Somehow, a login
        prompt would be provided on the machine, to enable a user to login to an
        'application server' somewhere on the network.

><P
>        This would be similar to a dumb X terminal, but would provide the option
        of logging on to the local machine itself, hence would be quite capable of
        becoming a standalone workstation (i.e. no network connectivity) if required.
        Most distributions can be configured 'out of the box' as a stand-alone
        X Workstation, with a graphical login prompt.

>Application Server</DT
><DD
><P
>        In the context of this document, I use the term 'application server' to
        describe a machine that will provide the applications (X clients) that our X
        terminal will want to run.  This can include everything from editors and browsers,
        through to the actual 'Window Manager' itself.

><P

        console (display, keyboard, mouse, etc).  It can be thought of as a combined
        graphics card, keyboard and mouse 'driver'.
        This will provide these facilities as a service to X clients (hence the term
        'server').  Please refer to the X User Howto in

        output without the services of the X server. The X server could be
        running locally (on the same machine, as is the case with an X
        workstation) or elsewhere on the network
        (as is the case with an X terminal connecting to an Application Server).

    to defined scripts and other configuration files.  In many cases,
    the defaults provided with your distribution should be fine, but
    for those of you who want more ...
    </P
><P
>    The names of the startup scripts and configuration files used by
    XDM are determined by a series of statements in the top-level
    xdm-config file.  This permits you to configure a different set
    of files for different X servers and X terminals, with different
    abilities.
    </P
><P
>    For example, say you are using XDM to manage your local display, but
    also want it to accept queries from other X terminals on the network.
    It is possible to specify a different Xresources file for each of these
    cases, by using the following 2 lines in xdm-config:
      <TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

><FONT

      </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR

    This will use Xres_0 for the local display (_0 is the XDM way of
    saying :0) and Xresources for everything else (the '*').
    </P
><P
>    Similarly, if you wanted a particular resource file for a specific
    host, you would use an entry like the following:
      <TABLE

><TR

></FONT

    </P
><P
>    Note that XDM configuration files use the terminology host_0, where you
    would normally use host:0, to designate 'display 0 on host'.
    </P
><P
>    If you look over your default xdm-config file, you will probably
    find that it has been setup so that your local X server has different
    files to the remote ones anyway, as different things must be performed
    on startup and reset of the server.  My Debian file has the following
    for local servers:
