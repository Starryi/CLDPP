><P
>     While many Linux users will give presentations at Linux User
     Group (LUG) meetings, Expos, and other conferences, not everyone
     is effective at giving presentations.  Much like public speaking,
     a presenter needs to know how to communicate with their audience
     so that their topic is clear and understood by all.  Topics
     that may interest users can easily be lost with ineffective
     presentations.  Hopefully this document will spell out how you can
     do this properly.

></H2
><P
>    Before you even give a presentation, there are a few things
    you have to do:
  </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>        Choose a topic.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>        Submit your topic to a show or LUG. (and get it accepted!)
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>        Create a presentation from the topic.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>        Give the presentation.
      </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>     Contrary to poular belief, each of these may be as hard as all the
     others.  Choosing a topic for some may be easy, based on their
     expertise, whereas a Linux jack-of-all-trades may be stuck choosing
     a topic.  Those comfortable with public speaking may have trouble
     designing the slides, and so on.
   </P
><P
>     So let's jump right in and hit all the topics and get you started!
   </P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="SECT1"
><HR><H2
CLASS="SECT1"
><A
NAME="TOPIC"
>3. Choosing a topic</A
></H2
><P
>    In many cases, you can choose your topic based on the area of expertise
    you have.  If you're a known (or unknown?) expert on RAID, you can give
    a presentation on RAID.  But what do you talk about on RAID?  Do you
    talk about the design of the controller drivers under Linux 2.4?  Do
    you talk about installing Linux on a RAID device?  Case study?
  </P
><P
>    Unfortunately, these are things you'll have to think about and decide
    on your own.  Your best bet is to think of a generic enough subject,
    and change it based on your audience (we'll get into this
    later on).  If you're talking to a more advanced LUG/USENIX crowd,
    you can give a more advanced presentation, whereas newbie groups can
    get a presentation of what RAID is and how it works.  The basic idea
    is to keep the intended audience in mind at all times.
  </P

NAME="SUBMIT"
>4. Submitting your topic</A
></H2
><P
>    Once you have the basic idea of what you want to present, you have
    to get it accepted by groups and get the opportunity to show it.
    Your best line of strategy is to start off giving your intended
    presentation to a local LUG and let them critique it.  Audience
    feedback is cruicial, especially if you have not done a presentation
    before.
  </P
><P
>    So what's the secret for talking to a LUG?  In many cases, just offer.
    LUGs like to have speakers for each meeting to give a reason
    to get together other than go for a beer after the meeting.
  </P
><P
>    In terms of conferences that you would like to attend, check the major
    conferences and expos out there.  Many are listed at Linux web sites,
    some send out a call for papers (CFP) to approprate discussion lists,
    like <CODE
CLASS="EMAIL"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:discuss@linuxdoc.org"
>discuss@linuxdoc.org</A
>&#62;</CODE
>.  Many will have
    either an e-mail CFP, or have you fill out a web form.
  </P
><P
>    I cannot comment on what papers are accepted or declined, mostly
    because I don't know how it works.  The best I can say is to see what
    topics have been selected in the past and tailor your abstract that way.
  </P
><P
>    Assuming your presentation has been selected, try and get some information
    about the location, dates, time, and so on.  This will have a lot of bearing
    on how your presentation is laid out. A presentaton using printed slides
    will appear different on screen than one with an LCD projector that
    connects to your laptop.  In some cases, you will need to bring your
    own laptop to the presentation.

><P
>     So how do you create the your content?  First, you'll want to have 
     some introductory information.  Your first slide should contain the
     title of the presentation, your name, and who you're representing
     (if anyone).  Remember that it's good form to include the name of
     the organization that is paying for your trip, even if they're not
     who you're representing.
   </P
><P
>     Your second slide should contain the agenda for the remainder
     of the presentation.  This serves two purposes - it not only
     tells the audience what to expect, but serves as an outline
     for you as you create the slides.
   </P
><P
>     Your third (or fourth, depending on how big the agenda is) should
     contain some information about you.  This gives you credibility
     with the audience as to your expertise with the subject matter.
   </P
><P
>     After that, it is up to you to start creating your slides.  However,
     here's a few hints to keep in mind as you go along:
   </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>         Make the text of the slides big, and the amount of text
         small.  You want everyone to be able to read what is on
         the slide.  A rule of thumb is that characters should
         be 1 inch high for every 10 feet that an audience member
         will be away from the screen.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         There is no real need to write in full sentences.  You
         will want to make short points, since your talking will
         fill in the details.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         If you use backgrounds in your slides, make them of light
         colors.  Dark colors will contrast the text when they
         are printed out as handouts for attendees.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         Stick to one topic per slide.  You can have multiple slides
         per topic, just title them "Topic", "Topic (cont'd)", or number
         them.

NAME="PRESENTING"
>6. Giving your presentation</A
></H2
><P
>     Before you give your presentation to a group of people, give it
     a test run to a friend or SO.  This lets you know how well
     the flow of the presentation is, plus may give ideas for improvement.
     You may also just want to give it in front of a mirror.
   </P
><P
>     If you have never taken a public speaking class, or given presentations
     to large groups, the first few times you do this it may seem unnerving.
     As I mentioned earlier, it may be easier to start with your local LUG
     and get used to talking to groups of people - the local LUG will be
     filled with a friendly audience and you will be more at ease.
   </P
><P
>     When talking to a large audience, keep the following in mind:
   </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>         Don't just read the text on the slides.  Anyone can put slides up
         and read the text on it.  You are an expert!  Make like one.
         Anecdotes (humorous or not) can increase the audience's interest
         in the subject, and increase your credibility.  Expand on topics
         that you think should be expanded.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         SPEAK SLOWLY.  Many people when talking with friends or in stresful
         situations will talk rapidly.  Not only does this make your
         presentation much slower than it needs to be, but makes it hard
         for your audience to understand you.  Also remember that not
         all of your audience speaks your language as their first language.
         On the same note, don't speak in a monotone.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         Keep eye contact with the audience.  Every now and then, look up
         from your screen and scan the audience.  If this makes you
         nervous, look across the tops of the heads.  From the perspective
         of the audience, you are looking at them.  Look up, and scan from
         one side of the room to the other, then look back at your screen.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         Feedback from microphones can cause headaches for all around.
         Test your microphone setup before talking.  Ask before you
         start your presentation if everyone can hear you clearly.
         If not, adjust your microphone.  Smaller rooms may not
         have microphones, so you will need to speak loudly.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         If you do not have a microphone, try and face your audience as
         much as possible.  Your voice will carry better.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         Do not let yourself get sidetracked.  Stay on the topic.  If
         a member of the audience tries to get you off topic too far,
         offer to discuss it after the presentation.  Others
         who are interested can take part then.
