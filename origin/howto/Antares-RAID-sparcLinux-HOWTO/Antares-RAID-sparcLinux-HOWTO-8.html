<P>These instructions cover setting up the virtual RAID drives on RedHat Linux
6.1. Setting it up under other Linux distributions should not be a problem.
The same general instructions apply. </P>
<P>If you are new to Linux you may want to consider installing Linux from
scratch since the RedHat installer will do most of the configuration work for
you. If so skip to section titled &#34;New Linux Installation.&#34; Otherwise
go to the &#34;Existing Linux Installation&#34; section (next).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="Antares-RAID-sparcLinux-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Existing Linux Installation</A>
</H2>


<P>Follow these instructions if you already have Redhat Linux installed on
your system and you do not want to re-install. If you are installing the RAID
as part of a new RedHat Linux installation (or are re-installing) skip to the
&#34;New Linux Installation&#34; section.</P>
<H3>QLogic SCSI Driver</H3>


<P>The driver can either be loaded as a module or compiled into your kernel.
If you want to boot from the RAID then you may want to use a kernel with compiled
in QLogic support (see the kernel-HOWTO available from http://www.linuxdoc.org.
To use the modular driver become the superuser and add the following lines
to /etc/conf.modules:
<PRE>
alias qlogicpti /lib/modules/preferred/scsi/qlogicpti 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Change the above path to where ever your SCSI modules live. Then add the
following line to you /etc/fstab (with the appropriate changes for device and
mount point, see the fstab man page if you are unsure)
<PRE>
/dev/sdc1 /home ext2 defaults 1 2
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Or, if you prefer to use a SYSV initialization script, create a file called
"raid" in the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory with the following contents (NOTE:
while there are a few good reasons to start the RAID using a script, one of
the aforementioned methods would be preferable):
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash

case &#34;$1&#34; in

      start)
      echo &#34;Loading raid module&#34;
      /sbin/modprobe qlogicpti
      echo
      echo &#34;Checking and Mounting raid volumes...&#34;
      mount -t ext2 -o check /dev/sdc1 /home
      touch /var/lock/subsys/raid
      ;;

      stop)
      echo &#34;Unmounting raid volumes&#34;
      umount /home
      echo &#34;Removing raid module(s)&#34;
      /sbin/rmmod qlogicpti
      rm -f /var/lock/subsys/raid
      echo
      ;;

      restart)

          $0 stop 
          $0 start 
      ;; 

      *)

      echo &#34;Usage: raid {start|stop|restart}&#34;

      exit 1

esac

exit 0 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You will need to edit this example and substitute your device name(s) in
place of /dev/sdc1 and mount point(s) in place of /home. The next step is to
make the script executable by root by doing: 
<PRE>
chmod 0700 /etc/rc.d/init.d/raid
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Now use your run level editor of choice (tksysv, ksysv, etc.) to add the
script to the appropriate run level.</P>
<H3>Device mappings</H3>


<P>Linux uses dynamic device mappings you can determine if the drives were
found by typing:
<PRE>
more /proc/scsi/scsi
</PRE>
</P>
<P>one or more of the entries should look something like this:
<PRE>
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00 
</PRE>

<PRE>
Vendor: ANTARES Model: CX106 Rev: 0109
</PRE>

<PRE>
Type: Direct-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</PRE>
</P>
<P>There may also be one which looks like this:
<PRE>
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 07
</PRE>

<PRE>
Vendor: ANTARES Model: CX106-SMON Rev: 0109
</PRE>

<PRE>
Type: Direct-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This is the SCSI monitor communications channel which is currently un-used
under Linux (see SMON in the advanced topics section below). </P>
<P>To locate the drives (following reboot) type:
<PRE>
dmesg | more
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Locate the section of the boot messages pertaining to you SCSI devices.
You should see something like this:
<PRE>
qpti0: IRQ 53 SCSI ID 7 (Firmware v1.31.32)(Firmware 1.25 96/10/15) 
</PRE>

<PRE>
[Ultra Wide, using single ended interface]
</PRE>

<PRE>
QPTI: Total of 1 PTI Qlogic/ISP hosts found, 1 actually in use.
</PRE>

<PRE>
scsi1 : PTI Qlogic,ISP SBUS SCSI irq 53 regs at fd018000 PROM node ffd746e0
 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Which indicates that the SCSI controller was properly recognized, Below
this look for the disk section:
<PRE>
Vendor ANTARES Model: CX106 Rev: 0109
</PRE>

<PRE>
Type: Direct-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</PRE>

<PRE>
Detected scsi disk sdc at scsi1, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
</PRE>

<PRE>
SCSI device sdc: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 20971200 [10239
 MB] [10.2 GB]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Note the line that reads &#34;Detected scsi disk sdc ...&#34; this
tells you that this virtual disk has been mapped to device /dev/sdc. Following
partitioning the first partition will be /dev/sdc1, the second will be /dev/sdc2,
etc. There should be one of the above disk sections for each virtual disk that
was detected. There may also be an entry like the following:
<PRE>
Vendor ANTARES Model: CX106-SMON Rev: 0109
</PRE>

<PRE>
Type: Direct-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</PRE>

<PRE>
Detected scsi disk sdd at scsi1, channel 0, id 0, lun 7
</PRE>

<PRE>
SCSI device sdd: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 20971200 [128 MB]
 [128.2 MB]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>BEWARE: this is not a drive DO NOT try to fdisk, mkfs, or mount it!! Doing
so WILL hang your system.</P>
<H3>Partitioning</H3>


<P>A virtual drive appears to the host operating system as a large but otherwise
ordinary SCSI drive. Partitioning is performed using fdisk or your favorite
utility. You will have to give the virtual drive a disk label when fdisk is
started. Using the choice "Custom with autoprobed defaults" seems to work
well. See the man page for the given utility for details. </P>
<H3>Installing a filesystem </H3>


<P>Installing a filesystem is no different from any other SCSI drive:
<PRE>
mkfs -t &lt;filesystem_type&gt; /dev/&lt;device&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>for example:
<PRE>
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdc1
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Mounting</H3>


<P>If QLogic SCSI support is compiled into you kernel OR you are loading the
&#34;qlogicpti&#34; module at boot from /etc/conf.modules then add the
following line(s) to the /etc/fstab:
<PRE>
/dev/&lt;device&gt; &lt;mount point&gt; ext2 defaults 1 1
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If you are using a SystemV initialization script to load/unload the module
you must mount/unmount the drives there as well. See the example script above.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="Antares-RAID-sparcLinux-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">New Linux Installation</A>
</H2>


<P>This is the easiest way to install the RAID since the RedHat installer
program will do most of the work for you.
<OL>
<LI>Configure the host port, RAID sets, and spares as outlined in &#34;Onboard
Configuration.&#34; Your computer must be on to perform this step since the
5070 is powered from the SBUS. It does not matter if the computer has an operating
system installed at this point all we need is power to the controller card.</LI>
<LI>Begin the RedHat SparcLinux installation</LI>
<LI>The installation program will auto detect the 5070 controller and load
the Qlogic driver</LI>
<LI>Your virtual RAID drives will appear as ordinary SCSI hard drives to be
partitioned and formatted during the installation. NOTE: When using the graphical
partitioning utility during the RedHat installation DO NOT designate any partition
on the virtual drives as type RAID since they are already hardware managed
virtual RAID drives. The RAID selection on the partitioning utilities screen
is for setting up a software RAID.
IMPORTANT NOTE: you may see a small SCSI
drive ( usually ~128 MB) on the list of available drives. DO NOT select
this drive for use. It is the SMON communication channel NOT a drive. If setup
tries to use it the installer will hang.</LI>
<LI>Thats it, the installation program takes care of everything else !!</LI>
