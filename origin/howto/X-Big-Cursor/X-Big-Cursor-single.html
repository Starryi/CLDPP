<H2>How to use enlarged mouse cursors with the X window system</H2>
<H2>
<A HREF="mailto:joerg.schneider@ira.uka.de">J&ouml;rg Schneider</A></H2>v2, 11 August 1997
<HR>
<EM>This document describes how to use enlarged mouse cursors with the X
window system.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="top"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>There are several reasons why the standard X mouse cursors are hard to
track for some people: 
<UL>
<LI> when running X on a notebook with low contrast LCD</LI>
<LI> on normal screens when using high resolution, 1600x1280 e.&nbsp;g.</LI>
<LI> for visually impaired persons even on normal hardware</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>In all cases it might help to use enlarged mouse cursors. Ideally this
job should be done by a single X program that automatically enlarges
every mouse cursor.</P>
<P>To my knowledge there is no simple way to write a utility like this,
because the X protocol has no provision to query mouse cursors. For
more details see section 
<A HREF="#tech">Technical discussion</A> below. </P>
<P>If we aim for a less general goal, though, something can be done: </P>
<P>There is a set of standard mouse cursors that can be found in the
cursor font (try <CODE>xfd -fn cursor</CODE> to look at it). Most programs use
these mouse cursors and the key idea is to replace the standard cursor
font with an enlarged version. </P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. About this document</A></H2>

<P>The motivation for this MINIHOWTO was a visually impaired co-student
who asked me how to enlarge the mouse cursor under X. After I found
out how this can be done, I wrote an initial version of this
document. The knowledge about the method described here does not seem
to be common, so I decided to share it and submitted this document as
a Linux MINIHOWTO, despite the fact that it is
<EM>not specific to Linux at all</EM>. As all other MINIHOWTOs it can be
found in the home of of the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/">Linux Documentation Project (LDP)</A>.</P>
<P>The 
<A HREF="http://i11www.ira.uka.de/~schneid/X11-big-cursor/master/">master</A> of
this document is maintained in the SGML/linuxdoc format. This makes it
possible to automatically provide versions in the following formats
(which can be found in the same place as the master): html, text,
LaTeX, DVI, PostScript, GNU info.</P>

<A HREF="mailto:shinobu@emichan.rim.or.jp">Shinobu Miyata</A> has
done a Japanese translation of this MINIHOWTO. It can be found in

<H2><A NAME="howto"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. How to do it</A></H2>

<P>Follow the steps detailed below. If you don't want to get and compile
the bdfresize package yourself, you can skip to step 3 and download a
magnified font instead of creating it.
<OL>
<LI> get cursor.bdf, the source of the cursor font, from some X
distribution, e.&nbsp;g. from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.3/xc/fonts/bdf/misc/cursor.bdf">ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.3/xc/fonts/bdf/misc/cursor.bdf</A> (if you don't 
find it there try an archie search or get it from 
<A HREF="http://i11www.ira.uka.de/~schneid/X11-big-cursor/cursor.bdf">my copy</A>).  </LI>
<LI> get, compile and install the bdfresize package from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp/X11/contrib/Local/bdfresize-1.4.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp/X11/contrib/Local/bdfresize-1.4.tar.Z</A>
(or from 
<A HREF="http://i11www.ira.uka.de/~schneid/X11-big-cursor/bdfresize-1.4.tar.gz">my copy</A>):
<PRE>
     zcat bdfresize-1.4.tar.Z  | tar xf -
     cd bdfresize-1.4
     xmkmf
     make
     
</PRE>

On Linux you probably have to use:
<PRE>
     make CCOPTIONS='-include /usr/include/bsd/bsd.h' clean all
     
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> create a directory and install a magnified cursor font in it
(magnification factor 2 in this example):

<PRE>
     mkdir $HOME/fonts
     bdfresize -f 2 cursor.bdf | bdftopcf >$HOME/fonts/cursor2.pcf
     mkfontdir $HOME/fonts
     
</PRE>

     
I have prepared some 
<A HREF="http://i11www.ira.uka.de/~schneid/X11-big-cursor/fonts/">cursor fonts</A>
with the following magnification factors: 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 and 16. You can download one of them an copy it to
<CODE>$HOME/fonts</CODE> if you don't want to use bdfresize.
</LI>
<LI> modify your <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> or <CODE>.xsession</CODE> file: before
any X client (that uses cursors) is started the following
commands must  be executed: 

<PRE>
     xset +fp $HOME/fonts
     xsetroot -cursor_name X_cursor
     
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI> leave your X session and restart.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>That's it&mdash;now all mouse cursors should have doubled in size. </P>


<H2><A NAME="notes"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Notes and limitations</A></H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> X servers may have a limit for the maximum cursor
size, especially if they use a hardware implementation for the mouse
cursor. Others do not have such a limit. E.&nbsp;g. XF86_S3&nbsp;3.3
works even with a 512x512 mouse cursor (rather slowly).</LI>
<LI> The magnified cursor font must have the same name as the original
font (the <EM>font name</EM> must be <CODE>cursor</CODE>, <EM>file name</EM> does not 
matter)&mdash;that is no problem as <CODE>bdfresize</CODE> does not change
the font name. </LI>
<LI> The directory with the new cursor font must be placed before the
directory with the standard cursor font in the the font path&mdash;this
is accomplished with <CODE>xset +fp</CODE> (as opposed to
<CODE>xset fp+</CODE>).</LI>
<LI> Changes in <CODE>$HOME/fonts/</CODE> will be visible only
after the command <CODE>mkfontdir $HOME/fonts; xset fp rehash</CODE> 
and only in newly
started X clients (more exactly: for newly created cursors).</LI>
<LI> <CODE>xset +fp path</CODE> may not work on a X-Terminal. In this case
a font server (see the section 
<A HREF="#fontserver">How to use a fontserver</A>)
can be used if supported by the X-Terminal or some
other method to install the font on the X-Terminal (this can
generally only be done by your system administrator).</LI>
<LI> The same approach can be used for <CODE>olcursor</CODE> and
<CODE>decw$cursor</CODE> fonts and any other cursor font you may
encounter.</LI>
<LI> Cursor fonts produced by bdfresize don't look smooth,
especially at larger magnification factors. It would be nice if
someone could create better looking handcrafted version at
some common sizes.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="tech"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Technical discussion</A></H2>

<P>Is it possible to write a X program that enlarges cursors
automatically?</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>(Partial) solution 1</B><DD>
<P>Use the XTestCompareCursor from the XTEST
extension. For all windows that the mouse pointer enters compare the
cursor of this window with a set of `known' cursors (e.&nbsp;g. from
the cursor font). If the cursor is found, replace it with an enlarged
version, otherwise either leave it alone or substitute a standard
cursor. This will only work where the XTest extension is available.</P>

<DT><B>Solution 2</B><DD>
<P>Write a proxy X server that relays all client requests
unchanged to the real X server, except that it intercepts all requests
corresponing to the <CODE>XCreate*Cursor</CODE> Xlib
functions. <CODE>XCreate*Cursor</CODE> requests should be modified to use
an enlarged cursor. </P>
<P>This proxy server simulates a new display, e.&nbsp;g. <CODE>:1</CODE>. All
clients that connect to this display (e.&nbsp;g. <CODE>xterm -display
:1</CODE>) are displayed on the real server (normally <CODE>:0</CODE>) and their
mouse cursors are enlarged automatically. The mouse cursors of clients
that connect to <CODE>:0</CODE> will remain <EM>unchanged</EM>.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ideas"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Other ideas how to make the mouse cursor more visible</A></H2>

<P>Here are some ideas for rather simple X programs that might make
mouse cursors easier to track.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> When a hot key is pressed display something (big cursor, small
window, shaped window) at pointer position for 0.5s.</LI>
<LI> use XRecolorCursor to change the mouse cursor color every 0.1s</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>A more demanding project would be <B>mouse trails</B> &agrave; la
windoze, i.&nbsp;e. when the mouse is moved and the mouse cursor needs
to be drawn in a different position, then the old mouse cursor does
not disappear at once, but after a short delay. Mouse trails would be
probably best implemented in a X server, but it might be feasible to
do it as a X client, or better as a proxy server (see section 
<A HREF="#tech">Technical discussion</A> for details).</P>

</H2>

<P>A font server is a net service that provides a set of X11 fonts
with a simple protocol. It can be queried which fonts it provides and
will supply the font bitmap data on request.</P>
<P>You might want to use a font server to provide the X server with a
modified cursor font, instead of telling it where to find the font on
the file system. </P>
<P>This method is especially handy if you use several machines that don't
share a common file system or if you use X terminals that support
the font server protocol. </P>
<P>A font server program and associated tools comes with the X11R5+
distribution (AFAIK). </P>

<H3><A NAME="fsconfig"></A> Setting up a font server</H3>

<P>Read the manual pages <EM>fs(1)</EM>, <EM>fslsfonts(1)</EM> (or
<EM>xfs(1)</EM>, <EM>xfslsfonts(1)</EM> under X11R6) and try it&mdash;it isn't
hard. Say, you are running the server on host <CODE>some.host.edu</CODE>
on port 7100. You can test the setup with the command </P>
<P><CODE>fslsfonts -server some.host.edu:7100</CODE></P>
<P>To actually use the server issue the command </P>
<P><CODE>xset +fp tcp/some.host.edu:7100</CODE></P>
<P>which should return without an error message.</P>

</H2>

<P>If you have set up a font server simply use <CODE>fstobdf</CODE> which
comes with the font server.</P>
<P>Alternatively you may try <CODE>getbdf</CODE> which can dump any installed
X11 font to a bdf file. </P>
