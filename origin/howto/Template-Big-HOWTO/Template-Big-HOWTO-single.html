   template to fill in to make new HOWTOs. This template was
   initially made by extracting the skeletal structure of the Multi

   extensive editing.

   a technical reference document I have rearranged the structure to
   this end. For the designer of a system it is more useful to have
   the information presented in terms of the goals of this exercise
   than from the point of view of the logical layer structure of the
   devices themselves. Nevertheless this document would not be
   complete without such a layer structure the computer field is so
   full of, so I will include it here as an introduction to how it

    This is the point of view I will adopt in this document in
    presenting the material, starting out with hardware, continuing
    with design constraints before detailing the design strategy that
    I have found to work well. I have used this both for my own
    personal computer at home, a multi purpose server at work and
    found it worked quite well. In addition my Japanese co-worker in
    this project have applied the same strategy on a server in an

>      Q:How many physical disk drives (spindles) does a Linux system need?
     </P
><P
>      A: Linux can run just fine on one drive (spindle).  Having
      enough  RAM (around 32 MB, and up to 64 MB) to support swapping
      is a  better price/performance choice than getting a second
      disk. (E)IDE disk is usually cheaper (but a little slower) than
      SCSI.

></LI
><LI
><P
>      Q: Are there any disadvantages in this scheme?
     </P
><P
>      A: There is only a minor snag: if even a single partition
      overflows the system might stop working properly. The severity
      depends of course on what partition is affected. Still this is
      not hard to monitor, the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>df</B
> gives
      you a good overview of the situation. Also check the swap
      partition(s) using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>free</B
> to make sure you are
      not about to run out of virtual memory.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Q: OK, so should I split the system into as many partitions as 
      possible for a single drive?
     </P
><P
>      A: No, there are several disadvantages to that. First of all
      maintenance becomes needlessly complex and you gain very little
      in this. In fact if your partitions are too big you will seek
      across larger areas than needed. This is a balance and
      dependent on the number of physical drives you have.
