<HR>
<EM>Sat technology is starting to become a great resource for Internet users,
 allowing high bandwidth in downloading and many other interesting services.
 This document wants to investigate "State of Art" of Sat connections in Linux
 environment, how to get them speeder and to share with many clients. You can
 found latest version of this document at

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>This document wants to explain something about Satellite technology, how
it works, what do you need, configuration and how to sharing it between several
clients. Satellite connections are very different from terrestrial ones, they
require more attention to setup and also some more care to maintain them stable
(snow or strong rain could prevent you to have a good signal).</P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Background Knowledge</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What about satellite</A>
</H2>

<P>In the last few years satellite began to be applied in Internet networking,
mainly by medium-big ISPs and we have seen it diffused between users. Sat connections
are a very different kind of networking than terrestrial ones, with different
timing such as higher RTT (round trip time), but also with different bandwidth
value, up to 2 Mbps or more.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 How does it work?</A>
</H2>

<P>We can imagine a path like this:</P>
<P>

             |                              |
            \|/                             |        
       USER PC ----make request-----&gt; SAT-SERVER &lt;---retrieving---&gt; INTERNET
                         (1)                               (2)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>So first we make the request (1) (using our Internet connection) to the
Sat-Server, after it will retrieve out info from Internet (2) and it will send
it to Satellite (3); in the end we would receive data from the it (4) to our
home using a parabolic antenna and a Sat Card.</P>
<P>Typically exist 2 kinds of request :</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Http</LI>
<LI>Ftp</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Both of them have a little request data and a much bigger answer size,
so satellite works very well with it, but with a big time of answer, this is
the biggest problem of satellite connection (consider a typical Sat distance,
like 36.000 km, so you would have a time access of [ 36000 km / 300.000
km/s = 0.120 s = ] 120 ms you have to add (2 times, cause first ISPs server
send it to, then you download it from) to classical Internet time access.</P>
<P>Recently ISP allows their clients to use also other kind of service, like</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Chat </LI>
<LI>Email </LI>
<LI>News </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>and many others.</P>
<P>There exist also services called "one-way", which consist in mail service
, download on-demand (where you make a file reservation to be scheduled at
some time) and site download: these services are offline, so you can access
to them without modem (or other kind of) connection.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Other technologies</A>
</H2>

<P>We have to report another satellite technology: the 2-way sat connection.
It uses only the parabolic antenna to contact Internet in both 2 directions.
Its cost is much higher that 1-way connection. We expect something from it
for immediate future, for now it allows a bandwidth of 4 Mbit/s in download
and 256Kbit/s in upload.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 What is the max bandwidth?</A>
</H2>

<P>It depends on many factors: ISP purpose, TCP window used, applications
used by the client and the more important of all, "Internet congestion".</P>
<P>You can expect a max bandwidth of 1-4 Mbps and a average of about 10-30
KBytes/s, but I repeat, it depends on many factors.</P>
<P>Anyway some ISPs tell you they give you a "Max" bandwidth, while the average
bandwidth could be very lower, due to intra-ISP congestion.</P>
<P>Some other ISPs guarantees you to have a "Minimal" bandwidth, which is more
meaningful than "MAX", cause it is available all the time.</P>
<P>Please see Appendix A for more about get downloading performance better.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 How much does it cost?</A>
</H2>

<P>We have to distinguish between hardware costs and account costs, the first
are known, while the second depend on which service you choose ("guaranteed"/"not
guaranteed", what bandwidth).</P>
<H3>Hardware costs</H3>

<P>To install our little satellite system we need:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Sat card</LI>
<LI>Parabolic antenna</LI>
<LI>one or more feed (converter)</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Noticed that we need a digital converter to use Internet via satellite.</P>
<P>Sat card costs depends on brand you choose, about 200US$-300US$.</P>
<P>Parabolic antenna is about 50 US$.</P>
<P>Converter is about 50US$.</P>
<P>So we have about 3-400 US$ of hardware cost (maybe you still have
to add installation cost!!).</P>
<P>If you want also receiver Crypt service:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>CI is about 100 US$.</LI>
<LI>CAM is about 100 US$-250 US$.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<H3>Account costs</H3>

<P>Here costs depend on what ISPs give you access, what's peak bandwidth,
if there is a guaranteed bandwidth (which is more important than peak one),
what kind of service they give you and so on.</P>
<P>Also some ISP gives you free access in change of viewing an always foreground
spot banner (you cannot iconize it!!): in this case you will pay when you'll
go to buy something showed in banner!!</P>
<P>Typically account costs are about 100-150 US$ at year for "not guaranteed"
services and 4-600 US$ or more for guaranteed ones (they guarantee you
a minimal bandwidth you can use also under congestion moments, obviously intra
Sat-ISP congestion!! When you go out to Internet nobody can guarantee you anything!!).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 What are the satellites used?</A>
</H2>

<P>When we speak about satellites we mean: Astra (19.2 degree SE), Hotbird
(13.2 degree SE), new Europestar (45 degree SE), Eutelsat (8 degree SW), Astra
(26E), ArabSat 3A (26E).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 What ISPs give Sat Internet Access?</A>
</H2>

<P>In Europe we know about 8 ISPs giving Sat access for Internet:</P>

</OL>
</P>
<P>EON gives access for about 150 US$ at year without guaranteed bandwidth.</P>
<P>Netsystem offers its services at "null cost", you just have to see its banner.</P>

<P>Starspeeder gives access ??? </P>
<P>Eliosat costs 350 US$ at year with a 128 Kbps guaranteed (minimal
service, see web site for more);in addition it gives 2-way technology access
for either receive and transmit.</P>
<P>SkyDSL gives access full-time and it costs about 15 US$ at month
with 128Kbit/s bandwidth, but it allows a bigger bandwidth where you pay each
Mb downloaded (you can select from 256Kbit/s up to 4Mbit/s), for more you can
visit its web site.</P>
<P>IMPORTANT : before subscribing some satellite account, please verify "foot
of Satellite" and diameter of parabola.</P>
<P>OpenSky started before summer 2001 in its "beta test": it allows you to try
the sat service downloading at maximum 300 MB at month (free). To register
you need to go at 
<A HREF="http://www.opensky.it/cc/index.asp?f=registrazione.htm">OpenSky registration procedure</A> (which is in italian language!).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 What else?</A>
</H2>

<P>With every kind of DVB card you can also receive TV digital channels (free
channels only) and some cards have support for common interface to watch encrypted
channel. </P>
<P>Follows the schema:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
Smart-Card -&gt; CAM -&gt; Common Interface -&gt; Sat Card (with support C.I.)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>CAM Card (there are many standards used for decryption: SECA, IRDETO, VIACCESS
and others) is the hardware allowing decryption (for TV, Radio and Data) while
the Common Interface or C.I. (ETSI EN 50221) allow connection between CAM and
Sat Card.</P>
<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Technical Information</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 General working</A>
</H2>

<P>We now try to understand how satellite connection works and at what conditions.</P>
<P>We can imagine a satellite link as a classical Wireless link, I mean a
link between 2 systems which don't use a real cable to talk each other.</P>
<P>Wireless link is very different from Wired link cause we have some additional
problems to solve, such as reachability, privacy problems and so on. Also there
could be weather problems, particularly in snow or rain conditions.</P>
<P>Anyway, we have to consider the first principle behind Wireless communication:
line of sight free, which is a MUST unless we are unable to talk. For more
you can see the 
<A HREF="http://www.fatamorgana.com/bertolinux/">Wireless-HOWTO</A>.</P>
<P>In sat connections we use a special kind of antenna, a parabolic one, that
gives us a very high gain in RX, needed to receive satellite signal: in fact
satellite has a geostational orbital at 36.000 km and the only kind of antenna
we can use for receiving is just a parabolic one.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Frequencies</A>
</H2>

<P>Frequency we receive is from 11GHz up to 12.7 GHz (from the satellite transponder,
the transmitter sending us datas), a very high freq., but the feed (converter
in the center of the parabola) converts it to, in output, 1-2 GHz so that we'll
able to send signal to the receiver through the cable (up to 40m depending
to cable loss).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 DVB Receiver Card</A>
</H2>

<P>

                                DVB Card
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Now we can imagine a classical RX at 1 GHz receiving analog signals from
the Sat, converting it to digital signals and giving all to the low level network
layer (ISO OSI 1,2): here, card firmware builds a 2 level packet (pretty like
ethernet) to be sent to our PC with Linux, Windows, or other system, and in
the end, we will only have to transform it to a TCP/IP packet.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Data Link Level DVB setting</A>
</H2>

<P>Here we have to config some settings, directly to the DVB card:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Frequency working, we have to set the satellite frequency (as from magazines):
it is between 11.8 GHz and 12.8 GHz for example 12640000 KHz</LI>
<LI>Symbol rate, measured in symbols per seconds, typically 22 MS/s (Mega Symbols
per seconds)</LI>
<LI>Polarization, which is an antenna setting configurable in software: possible
values are H (Horizontal) or V (Vertical).</LI>
<LI>PIDs. The PID is used for select a trasmission between many signal from
same frequency. </LI>
<LI>Also we have to specify the bitfilter mask, which tells us how large is
the destination MAC addresses group (bitfilter mask is similar to TCP/IP netmask,
the only difference is that the bitfilter mask is 48 bit size while TCP/IP
netmask is 32 bit size). Always Internet data is sent with Unicast PID, while
Video always is sent using Multicast PID .</LI>
<LI>Calculate MAC address: here we specify what will be our MAC address (for
our DVB card). You need to do this cause some ISP uses an algorithm (see Appendix
A for more) which calculates your MAC address from your IP address, some other
ISP uses your own MAC address.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 TCP/IP working</A>
</H2>

<P>As we said in 2.2 section, first we have to make a request using the modem
interface (i.e. ppp0 or whatever we use to reach Internet), then the answer
will return to our DVB interface (dvb0). </P>
<P>Modern O.S. allow us to receive packets from an input interface, different
from the output interface from where we made the request: to do it we have
to "disable" some packets flow control, such as type an </P>
<P>echo "0" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/dvb0/rp_filter (for Linux).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Authentication</A>
</H2>

<P>It remains only one thing to complete our description: authentication method.</P>
<P>Some Sat ISPs use the so called "Proxy Authentication": when you used their
proxy, you also need to give login and password to continue the request (you
should have been subscribed some kind of account to use their sat service):
once done, the ISP use your IP address to calculate your MAC address (see Appendix
A for more), to which send the answer.</P>
<P>Some other ISPs require you make a VPN connection (using your login and
password) first, then they will control your registration account (where they
retrieve your MAC address) and will send data directly to (and only to) your
card (your MAC address).</P>
<P>Anyway noticed that you can modify your dvb sat filter value to be able
to receive packets destined to EVERY mac address (related to a single frequency).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Services I can use with a sat connection</A>
</H2>

<P>Typically services you can have from sat connections depend on what authentication
system is used by ISP: </P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>with classical "Proxy Authentication" you can only use HTTP and FTP service,
while</LI>
<LI>with VPN connection you have (ideally) no limit to services you can use,
the only limit is decided by RTT (time access) to satellite, about 500-1000
ms average: so you can forget to use "Voice" or other "Real Time" services!! (see
<A HREF="http://www.fatamorgana.com/bertolinux">VoIP-HOWTO</A> for more). Anyway you still can use: mail, chat, telnet, ping, dns and so
on.</LI>

suggest to use analog converter cause, maybe, you have one (from precedent
installation) and cause it is more simple to calibrate it than digital one.</LI>

<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb">LinuxTV</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www2.arnes.si/~mthale1/index.html ">DVB-s PCI cards under Linux</A>.</P>

card) for Linux!</P>

<P>Once downloaded drivers, you have to untar them to a directory, enter it
and type "make" and "make insmod". To do this you need to have actual kernel sources
under /usr/src/linux (unless, download them from 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</A> and recompile them).</P>
<P>After made "make insmod", your system should have DVB modules loaded. To

</H2>

<P>/etc/dvbd.conf file is used to setup data-link parameters for your DVB

<P>
<UL>
<LI>"power", which indicates the power to LNB, 1=ON, 0=OFF. Usually you should
set it to 1, unless you do some kind of cascade between more than 1 LNB.</LI>
<LI>"symbolrate", this is the symbol rate per seconds, for example 22.000.000.</LI>
<LI>"frequency", at which receiving datas, like 12.640.000.</LI>
<LI>"ttk", the 22 kHz signal, almost always to 1.</LI>
<LI>"diseqc", used to control the diseq, (it means only when you have a diseq
controlling 2 or more converters) 0 if none.</LI>
<LI>"AFC", usually set to 1.</LI>
<LI>"polarization", 1 for horizontal or 0 for vertical one.</LI>
<LI>"filter_n &lt;PID&gt; &lt;MAC&gt; &lt;BITFILTER&gt;", where n is intended
0 for Unicast and 1-9 for Multicast; PID is expressed in decimal form, MAC
is the MAC address only valid for Multicast filter and BITFILTER is a number
which bits represent bytes to mask (for example 10 = 2 (bit 1) + 8 (bit 3),
so mask will be 00 00 FF 00 FF 00).</LI>

<H3>Patch for pppd</H3>

<P>As described at 
<A HREF="http://www.sigpipe.org/~me/vpn/pptp.html">PPTP description</A>, you need to patch your pppd daemon to support connection
with Netsystem VPN server (Linux server).</P>
<P>Warning: using pppd version &gt;= 2.4.0 you don't need pppd patch.</P>
<P>So you have to:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>download a 
<A HREF="ftp://cs.anu.edu.au/pub/software/ppp/">recent pppd version</A></LI>
<LI>download and gunzip the correspondent patch for pppd from

<LI>enter pppd directory</LI>
<LI>type "make", "make install"</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<H3>Routing settings</H3>

<P>Now your pppd will be able to working with:</P>
<P>"pptp vpn.netsystem.com debug user &lt;login&gt;" </P>
<P>where &lt;login&gt; is your login account from Netsystem: you should see,
in log file (/var/log/messages) ppp1 connection debug info. </P>
<P>If all is ok you should see ppp1 interface with "ifconfig" command.</P>
<P>If you still have problems on authentication, please add a "noauth" line
to your /etc/ppp/options file.</P>
<P>Once ppp1 interface is up, you should do the following:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>type "ifconfig ppp1" and find the IP address (I will call IP) on the right
of "P-t-P:" string.</LI>
<LI>delete it from routing table with "route del IP"</LI>

<LI>delete default gateway from ppp0 with "route del default"</LI>
<LI>add default gateway to ppp1 with "route add default dev ppp1"</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Points 1-3 are requested cause point-to-point interface are managed, under
Linux, adding the gateway to the new interface (which is not a good idea in
this case): unless it you will have a endless loop, cause your packet will
be continuously encapsulated on itself.</P>
<P>Points 4,5 are used to make "all internet requests" to ppp1 interface, so
we'll reach the "world" by using VPN connection: this could be not optimal in
some condition, for example for DNS queries, which could be sent directly to
avoid useless Sat delay time.</P>
<P>Instead of manually setup routing configuration you can try using these
little scripts: </P>
<P>&#34;netsystem.on&#34; script </P>
<P>______________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>route add IP_DNS1 dev ppp0 </P>

<P>notice hexadecimal notation 0x?? </P>
<P>After, you have to type "make" and use the new dvbd created.</P>
<P>Note: to successfully patch the dvbd.c you need to use dvb driver version
&gt;= 0.8.2, cause older versions have some instability problems.</P>
<H3>Test it</H3>

<P>Finally, we can test Netsystem under Linux. We can make a "ping www.somehostpingable.com"
and check the response time: it should be between 400 and 2000 ms.</P>
<P>If you still have problems, you should control if all is OK with VPN interface:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>open your preferred network sniffer (for example 
<A HREF="http://www.ethereal.net">Ethereal</A>) and starts to analyze
"ppp0" interface (ppp0, not ppp1!!)</LI>
<LI>make a ping</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>If VPN is ok you should see 2 (or maybe 1) GRE-Encapsulated packets each
second, endless. If you cannot view anything your VPN is not correctly working:
stop it and restart it.</P>
<H3>Get performance better</H3>

<P>Once you setup all things you NEED to use (particularly with Netsystem
service) some "download accelerator" to get performance better: please see Appendix
A for more.</P>
<H3>Sharing Netsystem with many clients</H3>

<P>To do this you can enable "IP Masquering", allowing your client to use VPN
like a normal Internet interface; main problem is that our satellite connection
is very good for download while it has bad performance for just browsing web
pages (or other service more interactive than downloading).</P>
<P>You can think to use 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org">Squid proxy</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.socks.nec.com/">Socks proxy</A>, but you don't solve your problems, cause even
now ALL your request would be forwarded to same interface, VPN.</P>
<P>The solution is to use 2 routing tables, one using direct line interface
and the other using VPN one. So you can do like this:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>be sure of have installed "iproute2" commands (for example type "ip" on shell
and control if it tells you something), for more see 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO.html">Linux 2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO</A>.</LI>
<LI>be sure of have started Netsystem service and annotate ppp1 interface IP
address, we'll call it LOCALIP.</LI>
<LI>type: "echo "210 sat" &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables", to more comfortable
call "sat" rule 210</LI>
<LI>type: "ip rule add from LOCALIP table sat", to create table "sat" relative
to all requests coming from LOCALIP IP address.</LI>
<LI>type: "ip route add default dev ppp1 table sat", to send all "sat" requests
(see above) to ppp1 interface.</LI>
<LI>if you use 
<A HREF="http://www.socks.nec.com/">Socks proxy</A> be sure to set, in sockd.conf file, "external" to LOCALIP. </LI>
<LI>if you use 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org">Squid proxy</A> be sure to set, in squid.conf file, "tcp_outgoing_address" to
LOCALIP.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Once done all that, you will notice to have 2 kind of working: without
any proxy your clients will ask to direct line, while by using proxy (squid
or sockd) the request will be forwarded to VPN interface and, definitely, toward
satellite.</P>
<P>Notice that maybe you wish to use sockd instead of squid, cause satellite
requests are typically used for download (while squid is typically used for
browsing...).</P>
<P>What happens with iproute2 commands is that, when you ask for an address
to sockd or squid, relative proxy (using IPLOCAL IP address, bound at run-time
by proxy network daemon) request enters the TCP/IP stack where kernel will
forward it (thanks to point 4 above) to sat table and, definitely (by using
point 5) to ppp1 interface. All other rules will be forwarded to classical
default route (I mean across ppp0 interface or whatever other interface for
direct Internet).</P>

<P>These connections have a very bad feature: very low interactively.</P>

<P>Now, if our communication has an high access time and if we had a little
TCP Window we would lose very much time only waiting for the data confirmation
(ACK), so the real bandwidth would decrease (for example if you have a 16KB
TCP window, typical of Windows systems and a RTT of 400 ms, you cannot overcome
16KB/0.4 = 40 KB/s)</P>

Window, so, in latest years, it starts to appear new applications ("download
