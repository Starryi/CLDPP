    to mass storage that must be understood.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm102"></a>5.1. Naming Convention</h3></div></div></div><p>Linux used to deal with two kind of drives, depending
      of the electronic interface (controller), IDE and SCSI.
      Oldtimers remember the day where cdwriters where acccessed
      through "SCSI emulation". In fact IDE and SCSI use mostly the
      same low level commands and for 2007 up, with the new "SATA"
      interface, the naming was unified and, in new ditributions,
      all the drives have the same naming. For this part, CD or DVD
      readers/writers are seen like Hard Drives.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm105"></a>5.1.1. Old IDE Names</h4></div></div></div><p>By convention, IDE drives where given device names 
        <code class="filename">/dev/hda</code>to 
        <code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code>. 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>H</em></span>ard 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span>rive 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>(
        <code class="filename">/dev/hda</code>) is the first drive and 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>H</em></span>ard 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span>rive 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span>(
        <code class="filename">/dev/hdc</code>) is the third.</p><p>A typical PC has two IDE controllers, each of which
        can have two drives connected to it. For example, 
        <code class="filename">/dev/hda</code>is the first drive (master) on the
        first IDE controller and 
        <code class="filename">/dev/hdd</code>is the second (slave) drive on the
        second controller (the fourth IDE drive in the
        computer).</p><p>So, typically, a computer with IDE controller can
        accomodate 4 drives: /dev/hda (primary master), /dev/hdb
        (primary slave), /dev/hdc (secondary master), /dev/hdd
        (secondary slave). Some (rare) Mother Boards have more than
        two controllers, some addition cards can also have
        controllers, these are numbered following the alphabet, but
        one have to figure out what real names are given for his
        particular hardware.</p><p>You can have drives where ever you want, it's not
        mandatory to fill the gaps. You may have interest to read
        about what drive/cdrom connect to what place, but it's out
        of this document scope.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm123"></a>5.1.2. New Hard Drives Names</h4></div></div></div><p>Now all the rotating hard drives uses the same names
        as the old SCSI controllers, that is "s" in place of "h",
        so /dev/sda, and so on. The number of drives depends on the
        number of controllers on the Mother Board or the extended
        boards. Usually 4 are available. What will be the number of
        a drive is up to the controller card and the way it's read
        by the kernel, so difficult to say at first.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm126"></a>5.1.3. Flash Drives Names</h4></div></div></div><p>Flash drives are usually not connected through IDE or
        SATA interfaces and so don't uses the same names. Several
        interfaces are used with each different names. The kernel
        documentations gives the names.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm129"></a>5.1.4. Low level Devices and Extra naming</h4></div></div></div><p>You will find in some apps references to lowlevel
        SCSI devices and various naming conventions, for example
        (wodim is the command line cd burner):</p><pre class="screen">
          wodim --scanbus

</pre><p>And you may have to use some sort of 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>SCSI:1,1,0</em></span>option to access the CDROM.
        try to avoid using this as much as possible, as it's very
        error prone and should be let to programmers only. I only
        mention it because you can't always avoid it.</p><p>If you do "cat /dev/ | more", you can see:</p><pre class="screen">

        (notice the "c" for "character"). Try not using them. 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>dmesg</em></span>and 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>more /var/log/boot.msg</em></span>should give you
        the usable sdxx device, like (short summary):</p><pre class="screen">
