<H1>Linux Ext2fs Undeletion mini-HOWTO</H1>

<HR>
<EM>Picture this.  You've spent the last three days with no sleep, no food, not
even a shower.  Your hacking compulsion has at last paid off: you've finished
that program that will bring you world-wide fame and recognition.  All that you
still need to do is tar it up and put it on Metalab.  Oh, and delete all those
Emacs backup files.  So you say <CODE>rm * ~</CODE>.  And too late, you notice
the extra space in that command.  You've just deleted your <EM>magnum opus</EM>!
But help is at hand.  This document presents a discussion of how to retrieve
deleted files from a Second Extended File System.  Just maybe, you'll be able
to release that program after all...</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This mini-Howto attempts to provide hints on how to retrieve deleted files
from an ext2 file system.  It also contains a limited amount of discussion of
how to avoid deleting files in the first place.</P>
<P>I intend it to be useful certainly for people who have just had, shall we say,
a little accident with <CODE>rm</CODE>; however, I also hope that people read it
anyway.  You never know: one day, some of the information in here could save
your bacon.</P>
<P>The text assumes a little background knowledge about UNIX file systems in
general; however, I hope that it will be accessible to most Linux users.  If
you are an outright beginner, I'm afraid that undeleting files under Linux
<EM>does</EM> require a certain amount of technical knowledge and persistence, at
least for the time being.</P>
<P>You will be unable to recover deleted files from an ext2 file system without
at least read access to the raw device on which the file was stored.  In
general, this means that you must be root, but some distributions (such as
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</A>) provide a
<CODE>disk</CODE> group whose members have access to such devices.  You also need
<CODE>debugfs</CODE> from the <CODE>e2fsprogs</CODE> package.  This should have been
installed by your distribution.</P>
<P>Why have I written this?  It stems largely from my own experiences with a
particularly foolish and disastrous <CODE>rm -r</CODE> command as root.  I deleted
about 97 JPEG files which I needed and could almost certainly not recover from
other sources.  Using some helpful tips (see section
<A HREF="#sec-credits">Credits and Bibliography</A>) and a great deal of
persistence, I recovered 91 files undamaged.  I managed to retrieve at least
parts of five of the rest (enough to see what the picture was in each case).
Only one was undisplayable, and even for this one, I am fairly sure that no
more than 1024 bytes were lost (though unfortunately from the beginning of the
file; given that I know nothing about the JFIF file format I had done as much
as I could).</P>
<P>I shall discuss further below what sort of recovery rate you can expect for
deleted files.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Revision history</A>
</H2>

<P>The various publicly-released revisions of this document (and their
publication dates) are as follows:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>v1.0 on 18 January 1997
</LI>
<LI>v1.1 on 23 July 1997 (see section
<A HREF="#sec-v1.1">Changes in version 1.1</A>)
</LI>
<LI>v1.2 on 4 August 1997 (see section
<A HREF="#sec-v1.2">Changes in version 1.2</A>)
</LI>
<LI>v1.3 on 2 February 1999 (see section
<A HREF="#sec-v1.3">Changes in version 1.3</A>)
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec-v1.1"></A> Changes in version 1.1</H3>

<P>What changes have been made in this version?  First of all, the thinko in
the example of file recovery has been fixed.  Thankyou to all those who wrote
to point out my mistaek; I hope I've learned to be more careful when making up
program interaction.</P>
<P>Secondly, the discussion of UNIX file system layout has been rewritten to be, I
hope, more understandable.  I wasn't entirely happy with it in the first place,
and some people's comments indicated that it wasn't clear.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the vast uuencoded gzipped tarball of <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> in the middle of the
file has been removed.  The program is now available on
<A HREF="http://pobox.com/~aaronc/tech/fsgrab-1.2.tar.gz">my website</A>
and on
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/file/">Metalab</A>
(and mirrors).</P>
<P>Fourthly, the document has been translated into the Linux Documentation
Project SGML Tools content markup language.  This markup language can be
easily converted to any of a number of other markup languages (including
HTML and LaTeX) for convenient display and printing.  One benefit of this is
that beautiful typography in paper editions is a much more achievable goal;
another is that the document has cross-references and hyperlinks when viewed
on the Web.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec-v1.2"></A> Changes in version 1.2</H3>

<P>This revision is very much an incremental change.  It's here mainly to
include changes suggested by readers, one of which is particularly important.</P>
<P>The first change was suggested by Egil Kvaleberg
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:egil@kvaleberg.no">egil@kvaleberg.no</A></CODE>,
who pointed out the <CODE>dump</CODE> command in <CODE>debugfs</CODE>.  Thanks again, Egil.</P>
<P>The second change is to mention the use of <CODE>chattr</CODE> for avoiding deleting
important files.  Thanks to Herman Suijs
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:H.P.M.Suijs@kub.nl">H.P.M.Suijs@kub.nl</A></CODE>
for mentioning this one.</P>
<P>The abstract has been revised.  URLs have been added for organisations and
software.  Various other minor changes have been made (including fixing typos
and so on).</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec-v1.3"></A> Changes in version 1.3</H3>

<P>Though it is the first release in 17 months, there is very little that is
new here.  This release merely fixes a few minor errors (typos, dangling
URLs, that sort of thing -- especially the non-link to the Open Group), and
updates a few parts of the text that have become hopelessly out-of-date,
such as the material on kernel versions and on <CODE>lde</CODE>.  Oh, and I've
changed `Sunsite' to `Metalab' throughout.</P>
<P>This release is anticipated to be the last one before release 2.0, which
will hopefully be a full Howto.  I have been working on some substantial
changes which will justify an increment of the major version number.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Canonical locations of this document</A>

<P>The latest public release of this document should always be available in
on the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">Linux Documentation Project site</A>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. How not to delete files</A></H2>

<P>It is vital to remember that Linux is unlike MS-DOS when it comes to
undeletion.  For MS-DOS (and its bastard progeny Windows 95), it is generally
fairly straightforward to undelete a file - the `operating system' (I use the
term loosely) even comes with a utility which automates much of the process.
For Linux, this is not the case.</P>
<P>So.  Rule number one (the prime directive, if you will) is:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>KEEP BACKUPS</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>no matter what.  Think of all your data.  Perhaps, like me, you keep several
years' of accumulated email, contacts, programs, papers on your computer.
Think of how your life would be turned upside down if you had a catastrophic
disk failure, or if -- heaven forbid! -- a malicious cracker wiped your
disks.  This is not unlikely; I have corresponded with a number of people in
just such a situation.  I exhort all right-thinking Linux users to go out
and buy a useful backup device, work out a decent backup schedule, and to
<EM>stick to it</EM>.  Myself, I use a spare hard disk on a second machine, and
periodically mirror my home directory onto it over the ethernet.  For more
information on planning a backup schedule, read Frisch (1995) (see section
<A HREF="#sec-credits">Bibliography and Credits</A>).</P>
<P>In the absence of backups, what then?  (Or even in the presence of backups:
belt and braces is no bad policy where important data is concerned.)</P>
<P>Try to set the permissions for important files to 440 (or less): denying
yourself write access to them means that <CODE>rm</CODE> requires an explicit
confirmation before deleting.  (I find, however, that if I'm recursively
deleting a directory with <CODE>rm -r</CODE>, I'll interrupt the program on the first
or second confirmation request and reissue the command as <CODE>rm -rf</CODE>.)</P>
<P>A good trick for selected files is to create a hard link to them in a hidden
directory.  I heard a story once about a sysadmin who repeatedly deleted
<CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> by accident (thereby half-destroying the system).  One of
the fixes for this was to do something like the following (as root):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkdir /.backup
# ln /etc/passwd /.backup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>It requires quite some effort to delete the file contents completely: if
you say</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# rm /etc/passwd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>then</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# ln /.backup/passwd /etc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>will retrieve it.  Of course, this does not help in the event that you
overwrite the file, so keep backups anyway.</P>
<P>On an ext2 file system, it is possible to use ext2 attributes to protect things.
These attributes are manipulated with the <CODE>chattr</CODE> command.  There is an
`append-only' attribute: a file with this attribute may be appended to, but may
not be deleted, and the existing contents of the file may not be overwritten.
If a directory has this attribute, any files or directories within it may be
modified as normal, but no files may be deleted.  The `append-only' attribute
is set with</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ chattr +a FILE...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>There is also an `immutable' attribute, which can only be set or cleared by
root.  A file or directory with this attribute may not be modified, deleted,
renamed, or (hard) linked.  It may be set as follows:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chattr +i FILE...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The ext2fs also provides the `undeletable' attribute (<CODE>+u</CODE> in <CODE>chattr</CODE>).
The intention is that if a file with that attribute is deleted, instead of
actually being reused, it is merely moved to a `safe location' for deletion at
a later date.  Unfortunately this feature has not yet been implemented in
mainstream kernels; and though in the past there has been some interest in
implementing it, it is not (to my knowledge) available for any current kernels.</P>
<P>Some people advocate making <CODE>rm</CODE> a shell alias or function for <CODE>rm -i</CODE>
(which asks for confirmation on <EM>every</EM> file you delete).  Indeed, the
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat distribution</A> does this by
default for all users, including root.  Personally, I cannot stand software
which won't run unattended, so I don't do that.  There is also the problem
that sooner or later, you'll be running in single-user mode, or using a
different shell, or even a different machine, where your <CODE>rm</CODE> function
doesn't exist.  If you expect to be asked for confirmation, it is easy to
forget where you are and to specify too many files for deletion.  Likewise,
the various scripts and programs that replace <CODE>rm</CODE> are, IMHO, very
dangerous.</P>
<P>A slightly better solution is to start using a package which handles
`recyclable' deletion by providing a command not named <CODE>rm</CODE>.  For details
on these, see Peek, et al (1993) (see section
<A HREF="#sec-credits">Bibliography and Credits</A>).  These however
still suffer from the problem that they tend to encourage the user to have a
nonchalant attitude to deletion, rather than the cautious approach that is
often required on Unix systems.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s3">3. What recovery rate can I expect?</A></H2>

<P>That depends.  Among the problems with recovering files on a
high-quality, multi-tasking, multi-user operating system like Linux is that
you never know when someone wants to write to the disk.  So when the
operating system is told to delete a file, it assumes that the blocks used
by that file are fair game when it wants to allocate space for a new file.
(This is a specific example of a general principle for Unix-like systems:
the kernel and the associated tools assume that the users aren't idiots.)
In general, the more usage your machine gets, the less likely you are to be
able to recover files successfully.</P>
<P>Also, disk fragmentation can affect the ease of recovering files.  If the
partition containing the deleted files is very fragmented, you are unlikely to
be able to read a whole file.</P>
<P>If your machine, like mine, is effectively a single-user workstation, and
you weren't doing anything disk-intensive at the fatal moment of deleting
those files, I would expect a recovery rate in the same ball-park as
detailed above.  I retrieved nearly 94% of the files (and these were
binary files, please note) undamaged.  If you get 80% or better, you
can feel pretty pleased with yourself, I should think.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s4">4. So, how do I undelete a file?</A></H2>

<P>The procedure principally involves finding the data on the raw partition
device and making it visible again to the operating system.  There are
basically two ways of doing this: one is to modify the existing file system such
that the deleted inodes have their `deleted' flag removed, and hope that the
data just magically falls back into place.  The other method, which is safer
but slower, is to work out where the data lies in the partition and write it
out into a new file on another file system.</P>
<P>There are some steps you need to take before beginning to
attempt your data recovery; see sections
<A HREF="#sec-umount">Unmounting the file system</A>,
<A HREF="#sec-prep-chg">Preparing to change inodes directly</A> and
<A HREF="#sec-prep-wrt">Preparing to write data elsewhere</A> for details.
To find out how to actually retrieve your files, see sections
<A HREF="#sec-finding">Finding the deleted inodes</A>,
<A HREF="#sec-obtain">Obtaining the details of the inodes</A>,
<A HREF="#sec-recover">Recovering data blocks</A> and
<A HREF="#sec-modify">Modifying inodes directly</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="sec-umount"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Unmounting the file system</A></H2>

<P>Regardless of which method you choose, the first step is to unmount the
file system containing the deleted files.  I strongly discourage any urges
you may have to mess around on a mounted file system.  This step should be
performed <EM>as soon as possible</EM> after you realise that the files have
been deleted; the sooner you can unmount, the smaller the chance that your
data will be overwritten.</P>
<P>The simplest method is as follows: assuming the deleted files were in the
<CODE>/usr</CODE> file system, say:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# umount /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You may, however, want to keep some things in <CODE>/usr</CODE> available.  So
remount it read-only:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -o ro,remount /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If the deleted files were on the root partition, you'll need to add a <CODE>-n</CODE>
option to prevent mount from trying to write to <CODE>/etc/mtab</CODE>:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -n -o ro,remount /
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Regardless of all this, it is possible that there will be another process using
that file system (which will cause the unmount to fail with an error such as
`Resource busy').  There is a program which will send a signal to any process
using a given file or mount point: <CODE>fuser</CODE>.  Try this for the <CODE>/usr</CODE>
partition:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -v -m /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This lists the processes involved.  Assuming none of them are vital, you
can say</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -k -v -m /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to send each process a <CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> (which is guaranteed to kill it), or for
example,</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -k -TERM -v -m /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to give each one a <CODE>SIGTERM</CODE> (which will normally make the process exit
cleanly).</P>


<H2><A NAME="sec-prep-chg"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Preparing to change inodes directly</A></H2>

<P>My advice?  Don't do it this way.  I really don't think it's wise to play
with a file system at a low enough level for this to work.  This method also
has problems in that you can only reliably recover the first 12 blocks of
each file.  So if you have any long files to recover, you'll normally have
to use the other method anyway.  (Although see section
<A HREF="#sec-easier">Will this get easier in future?</A> for additional
information.)</P>
<P>If you feel you must do it this way, my advice is to copy the raw partition
data to an image on a different partition, and then mount this using loopback:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp /dev/hda5 /root/working
# mount -t ext2 -o loop /root/working /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(Note that obsolete versions of <CODE>mount</CODE> may have problems with this.  If
your <CODE>mount</CODE> doesn't work, I strongly suggest you get the latest version,
or at least version 2.7, as some very old versions have severe security
bugs.)</P>
<P>Using loopback means that if and when you completely destroy the file
system, all you have to do is copy the raw partition back and start over.</P>


<H2><A NAME="sec-prep-wrt"></A> <A NAME="s7">7. Preparing to write data elsewhere</A></H2>

<P>If you chose to go this route, you need to make sure you have a rescue
partition somewhere -- a place to write out new copies of the files you
recover.  Hopefully, your system has several partitions on it: perhaps a
root, a <CODE>/usr</CODE>, and a <CODE>/home</CODE>.  With all these to choose from,
you should have no problem: just create a new directory on one of these.</P>
<P>If you have only a root partition, and store everything on that, things are
slightly more awkward.  Perhaps you have an MS-DOS or Windows partition you
could use?  Or you have the ramdisk driver in your kernel, maybe as a
module?  To use the ramdisk (assuming a kernel more recent than 1.3.48), say
the following:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram0 bs=1k count=2048
# mke2fs -v -m 0 /dev/ram0 2048
# mount -t ext2 /dev/ram0 /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This creates a 2MB ramdisk volume, and mounts it on <CODE>/mnt</CODE>.</P>
<P>A short word of warning: if you use <CODE>kerneld</CODE> (or its replacement
<CODE>kmod</CODE> in 2.2.x and later 2.1.x kernels) to automatically load and unload
kernel modules, then don't unmount the ramdisk until you've copied any files
from it onto non-volatile storage.  Once you unmount it, <CODE>kerneld</CODE>
assumes it can unload the module (after the usual waiting period), and once
this happens, the memory gets re-used by other parts of the kernel, losing
all the painstaking hours you just spent recovering your data.</P>
<P>If you have a Zip, Jaz, or LS-120 drive, or something similar, it would
probably be a good choice for a rescue partition location.  Otherwise,
you'll just have to stick with floppies.</P>
<P>The other thing you're likely to need is a program which can read the
necessary data from the middle of the partition device.  At a pinch, <CODE>dd</CODE>
will do the job, but to read from, say, 600 MB into an 800 MB partition,
<CODE>dd</CODE> insists on reading but ignoring the first 600 MB.  This takes a not
inconsiderable amount of time, even on fast disks.  My way round this was to
write a program which will seek to the middle of the partition.  It's called
<CODE>fsgrab</CODE>; you can find the source package on
<A HREF="http://pobox.com/~aaronc/tech/fsgrab-1.2.tar.gz">my website</A>
or on
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/file/">Metalab</A>
(and mirrors).  If you want to use this method, the rest of this mini-Howto
assumes that you have <CODE>fsgrab</CODE>.</P>
<P>If none of the files you are trying to recover were more than 12 blocks long
(where a block is usually one kilobyte), then you won't need <CODE>fsgrab</CODE>.</P>
<P>If you need to use <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> but don't want to download and build it, it
is fairly straightforward to translate an <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> command-line to one
for <CODE>dd</CODE>.  If we have</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
fsgrab -c <EM>count</EM> -s <EM>skip</EM> <EM>device</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>then the corresponding (but typically much slower) <CODE>dd</CODE> command is</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
dd bs=1k if=<EM>device</EM> count=<EM>count</EM> skip=<EM>skip</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>I must warn you that, although <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> functioned perfectly for me, I can
take no responsibility for how it performs.  It was really a very quick and
dirty kludge just to get things to work.  For more details on the lack of
warranty, see the `No Warranty' section in the <CODE>COPYING</CODE> file included with
it (the GNU General Public Licence).</P>


<H2><A NAME="sec-finding"></A> <A NAME="s8">8. Finding the deleted inodes</A></H2>

<P>The next step is to ask the file system which inodes have recently been
freed.  This is a task you can accomplish with <CODE>debugfs</CODE>.  Start
<CODE>debugfs</CODE> with the name of the device on which the file system is stored:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# debugfs /dev/hda5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to modify the inodes directly, add a <CODE>-w</CODE> option to enable
writing to the file system:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# debugfs -w /dev/hda5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>debugfs</CODE> command to find the deleted inodes is <CODE>lsdel</CODE>.  So, type
the command at the prompt:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
debugfs:  lsdel
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>After much wailing and grinding of disk mechanisms, a long list is piped into
your favourite pager (the value of <CODE>$PAGER</CODE>).  Now you'll want to
save a copy of this somewhere else.  If you have <CODE>less</CODE>, you can type
<CODE>-o</CODE> followed by the name of an output file.  Otherwise, you'll have to
arrange to send the output elsewhere.  Try this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
debugfs:  quit
# echo lsdel | debugfs /dev/hda5 > lsdel.out
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now, based only on the deletion time, the size, the type, and the numerical
permissions and owner, you must work out which of these deleted inodes are the
ones you want.  With luck, you'll be able to spot them because they're the big
bunch you deleted about five minutes ago.  Otherwise, trawl through that list
carefully.</P>
<P>I suggest that if possible, you print out the list of the inodes you want to
recover.  It will make life a lot easier.</P>


<H2><A NAME="sec-obtain"></A> <A NAME="s9">9. Obtaining the details of the inodes</A></H2>

<P><CODE>debugfs</CODE> has a <CODE>stat</CODE> command which prints details about an inode.
Issue the command for each inode in your recovery list.  For example, if you're
interested in inode number 148003, try this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
debugfs:  stat &lt;148003>

<P>If you have a lot of files to recover, you'll want to automate this.  Assuming

<P>Of course, it is possible that one or more of the blocks that made up your file
has been overwritten.  If so, then you're out of luck: that block is gone
forever.  (But just imagine if you'd unmounted sooner!)</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 Longer files</A>
</H2>

<P>The problems appear when the file has more than 12 data blocks.  It pays
here to know a little of how UNIX file systems are structured.  The file's data
is stored in units called `blocks'.  These blocks may be numbered sequentially.
A file also has an `inode', which is the place where information such as owner,
permissions, and type are kept.  Like blocks, inodes are numbered sequentially,
although they have a different sequence.  A directory entry consists of the
name of the file and an inode number.</P>
<P>But with this state of affairs, it is still impossible for the kernel to find
the data corresponding to a directory entry.  So the inode also stores the
location of the file's data blocks, as follows:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The block numbers of the first 12 data blocks are stored directly in the
inode; these are sometimes referred to as the <EM>direct block</EM>s.
</LI>
<LI>The inode contains the block number of an <EM>indirect block</EM>.  An
indirect block contains the block numbers of 256 additional data blocks.
</LI>
<LI>The inode contains the block number of a <EM>doubly indirect block</EM>.  A
doubly indirect block contains the block numbers of 256 additional indirect
blocks.
</LI>
<LI>The inode contains the block number of a <EM>triply indirect block</EM>.  A
triply indirect block contains the block numbers of 256 additional doubly
indirect blocks.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Read that again: I know it's complex, but it's also important.</P>
<P>Now, the kernel implementation for all versions up to and including 2.0.36
unfortunately zeroes all indirect blocks (and doubly indirect blocks, and so
on) when deleting a file.  So if your file was longer than 12 blocks, you
have no guarantee of being able to find even the numbers of all the blocks
you need, let alone their contents.</P>
<P>The only method I have been able to find thus far is to assume that the file
was not fragmented: if it was, then you're in trouble.  Assuming that the file
was not fragmented, there are several layouts of data blocks, according to how
many data blocks the file used:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>0 to 12</B><DD>
<P>The block numbers are stored in the inode, as described above.</P>

<DT><B>13 to 268</B><DD>
<P>After the direct blocks, count one for the indirect block, and
then there are 256 data blocks.</P>

<DT><B>269 to 65804</B><DD>
<P>As before, there are 12 direct blocks, a (useless) indirect
block, and 256 blocks.  These are followed by one (useless) doubly indirect
block, and 256 repetitions of one (useless) indirect block and 256 data blocks.</P>

<DT><B>65805 or more</B><DD>
<P>The layout of the first 65804 blocks is as above.  Then
follow one (useless) triply indirect block and 256 repetitions of a `doubly
indirect sequence'.  Each doubly indirect sequence consists of a (useless)
doubly indirect block, followed by 256 repetitions of one (useless) indirect
block and 256 data blocks.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Of course, even if these assumed data block numbers are correct, there is no
guarantee that the data in them is intact.  In addition, the longer the file
was, the less chance there is that it was written to the file system without
appreciable fragmentation (except in special circumstances).</P>
<P>You should note that I assume throughout that your blocksize is 1024 bytes, as
this is the standard value.  If your blocks are bigger, some of the numbers
above will change.  Specifically: since each block number is 4 bytes long,
blocksize/4 is the number of block numbers that can be stored in each indirect
block.  So every time the number 256 appears in the discussion above, replace
it with blocksize/4.  The `number of blocks required' boundaries will also have
to be changed.</P>
<P>Let's look at an example of recovering a longer file.</P>

<P>There seems to be a reasonable chance that this file is not fragmented:
certainly, the first 12 blocks listed in the inode (which are all data blocks)
are contiguous.  So, we can start by retrieving those blocks:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fsgrab -c 12 -s 8314 /dev/hda5 > /mnt/recovered.001
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now, the next block listed in the inode, 8326, is an indirect block, which we
can ignore.  But we trust that it will be followed by 256 data blocks (numbers
8327 through 8582).</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fsgrab -c 256 -s 8327 /dev/hda5 >> /mnt/recovered.001

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The final block listed in the inode is 8583.  Note that we're still looking
good in terms of the file being contiguous: the last data block we wrote out
was number 8582, which is 8327 + 255.  This block 8583 is a doubly indirect
block, which we can ignore.  It is followed by up to 256 repetitions of an
indirect block (which is ignored) followed by 256 data blocks.  So doing the
arithmetic quickly, we issue the following commands.  Notice that we skip the
doubly indirect block 8583, and the indirect block 8584 immediately (we hope)
following it, and start at block 8585 for data.</P>

<P>Adding up, we see that so far we've written 12 + (7 * 256) blocks, which is
1804.  The `stat' results for the inode gave us a `blockcount' of 3616;
unfortunately these blocks are 512 bytes long (as a hangover from UNIX), so we
really want 3616/2 = 1808 blocks of 1024 bytes.  That means we need only four
more blocks.  The last data block written was number 10125.  As we've been
doing so far, we skip an indirect block (number 10126); we can then write those
last four blocks.</P>

<P>That is, I set the deletion time to 0 and the link count to 1 and just pressed
return for each of the other fields.  Granted, this is a little unwieldy if you
have a lot of files to recover, but I think you can cope.  If you'd wanted
chrome, you'd have used a graphical `operating system' with a pretty `Recycle
Bin'.</P>
<P>By the way: the <CODE>mi</CODE> output refers to a `Creation time' field in the
inode.  This is a lie!  (Or misleading, anyway.)  The fact of the matter is
that you cannot tell on a UNIX file system when a file was created.  The
<CODE>st_ctime</CODE> member of a <CODE>struct stat</CODE> refers to the `inode change time',
that is, the last time when any inode details were changed.  Here endeth
today's lesson.</P>
<P>Note that more recent versions of <CODE>debugfs</CODE> than the one I'm using probably
do not include some of the fields in the listing above (specifically,
<CODE>Reserved1</CODE> and (some of?) the fragment fields).</P>
<P>Once you've modified the inodes, you can quit <CODE>debugfs</CODE> and say:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# e2fsck -f /dev/hda5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The idea is that each of the deleted files has been literally undeleted, but
none of them appear in any directory entries.  The <CODE>e2fsck</CODE> program can
detect this, and will add a directory entry for each file in the
<CODE>/lost+found</CODE> directory of the file system.  (So if the partition is
normally mounted on <CODE>/usr</CODE>, the files will now appear in
<CODE>/usr/lost+found</CODE> when you next mount it.)  All that still remains to
be done is to work out the name of each file from its contents, and return
it to its correct place in the file system tree.</P>
<P>When you run <CODE>e2fsck</CODE>, you will get some informative output, and some
questions about what damage to repair.  Answer `yes' to everything that refers
to `summary information' or to the inodes you've changed.  Anything else I
leave up to you, although it's usually a good idea to say `yes' to all the
questions.  When <CODE>e2fsck</CODE> finishes, you can remount the file system.</P>
<P>Actually, there's an alternative to having <CODE>e2fsck</CODE> leave the files in
<CODE>/lost+found</CODE>: you can use <CODE>debugfs</CODE> to create a link in the
file system to the inode.  Use the <CODE>link</CODE> command in <CODE>debugfs</CODE> after
you've modified the inode:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
debugfs:  link &lt;148003> foo.txt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This creates a file called <CODE>foo.txt</CODE> in what <CODE>debugfs</CODE> thinks is the
current directory; <CODE>foo.txt</CODE> will be your file.  You'll still need to run
<CODE>e2fsck</CODE> to fix the summary information and block counts and so on.</P>


<H2><A NAME="sec-easier"></A> <A NAME="s12">12. Will this get easier in future?</A></H2>

<P>Yes.  In fact, I believe it already has.  Although as of this writing,
current stable kernels (in the 2.0.x series) zero indirect blocks, this does
not apply to development kernels in the 2.1.x series, nor to the stable
2.2.x series.  As I write this on 2 February 1999, kernel 2.2.1 was released
a few days ago; Linux vendors are likely to start producing distributions
containing and supporting 2.2.x kernels a month or two from now.</P>
<P>Once the indirect-zeroing limitation has been overcome in the production
kernels, a lot of my objections to the technique of modifying inodes by hand
will disappear.  At the same time, it will also become possible to use the
<CODE>dump</CODE> command in <CODE>debugfs</CODE> on long files, and to conveniently use
other undeletion tools.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s13">13. Are there any tools to automate this process?</A></H2>

<P>As it happens, there are.  Unfortunately, I believe that they currently
suffer from the same problem as the manual inode modification technique:
indirect blocks are unrecoverable.  However, given the likelihood that this
will shortly no longer be a problem, it's well worth looking these programs
out now.</P>
<P>I have written a tool called <CODE>e2recover</CODE>, which is essentially a Perl
wrapper around <CODE>fsgrab</CODE>.  It makes a reasonable amount of effort to deal
with zeroed indirect blocks, and seems to work fairly well as long as there
was no fragmentation.  It also correctly sets the permissions (and when
possible the ownership) of recovered files, and even makes sure that
recovered files have the correct length.</P>
<P>I originally wrote <CODE>e2recover</CODE> for the forthcoming major update to this
Howto; unfortunately this means that much of the useful documentation for
<CODE>e2recover</CODE> is scheduled for inclusion in that update.  Be that as it
may, it should be useful now; it can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://pobox.com/~aaronc/tech/e2-undel/">my web site</A>, and
soon from Metalab.</P>
<P>Scott D. Heavner is the author of <CODE>lde</CODE>, the Linux Disk Editor.  It can
be used as both a binary disk editor, and as an equivalent to <CODE>debugfs</CODE>
for ext2 and minix file systems, and even for xia file systems (though xia
support is no longer available in 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernels).  It has some
features for assisting undeletion, both by walking the block list for a
file, and by grepping through disk contents.  It also has some fairly useful
documentation on basic file system concepts, as well as a document on how to
use it for undeletion.  Version 2.4 of <CODE>lde</CODE> is available on
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/lde-2.4.tar.gz">Metalab</A>
and mirrors, or on
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/7731/lde.html">the author's web site</A>.</P>
<P>Another possibility is offered by the GNU Midnight Commander, <CODE>mc</CODE>.  This
is a full-screen file management tool, based AFAIK on a certain MS-DOS
program commonly known as `NC'.  <CODE>mc</CODE> supports the mouse on the Linux
console and in an xterm, and provides virtual file systems which allow
tricks like <CODE>cd</CODE>-ing to a tarfile.  Among its virtual file systems is one
for ext2 undeletion.  It all sounds very handy, although I must admit I
don't use the program myself -- I prefer good old-fashioned shell commands.</P>
<P>To use the undeletion feature, you have to configure the program with the
<CODE>-</CODE><CODE>-with-ext2undel</CODE> option; you'll also need the development libraries and
include files that come with the <CODE>e2fsprogs</CODE> package.  The version
provided in 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</A> is
built in this way; the same may apply to packages for other Linux
distributions.  Once the program is built, you can tell it to <CODE>cd
undel:/dev/hda5</CODE>, and get a `directory listing' of deleted files.  Like
many current undeletion tools, it handles zeroed indirect blocks poorly --
it typically just recovers the first 12k of long files.</P>
<P>The current version may be downloaded from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/Midnight/devel/">the Midnight Commander ftp site</A>.</P>
