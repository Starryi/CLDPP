>This document describes the Miniloader for Linux on Alpha AXP (MILO).
This firmware is used to initialize Alpha AXP based systems, load and
start Linux and, finally, provide PALcode for Linux. Please note that
the prefered way of booting Linux is via SRM console and MILO should
only be used if either there is no SRM console for your hardware (XL series)
or your current hardware isn't supported by SRM.</P

NAME="WHAT-SECTION"
>2. What is MILO?</A
></H2
><P
>On Intel based PC systems, the BIOS firmware
sets up the system and then loads the image to be run from the boot 
block of a DOS file system.
This is more or less what MILO does on an Alpha based system,
however there are several interesting differences between BIOS firmware and
MILO, not least of which is that MILO includes and 
uses standard Linux device drivers unmodified.
MILO is firmware, unlike LILO, which relies on the BIOS firmware to 
get itself loaded.
The main functional parts of MILO are:</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
> PALcode,</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Memory set up code (builds page tables and turns on virtual addressing),</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Video code (BIOS emulation code and TGA (21030)),</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Linux kernel code.  This includes real Linux
kernel code (for example, the interrupt handling) and 
ersatz or mock Linux kernel,</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Linux block device drivers (for example, the floppy driver),</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> File system support (ext2, MS-DOS and ISO9660),</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> User inteface code (MILO),</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Kernel interface code (sets up the HWRPB and memory map for linux),</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> NVRAM code for managing environment variables.</P
></LI
></OL
>&#13;</P
><P
>The following paragraphs describe these functional parts in more detail.</P
><P
>PALcode can be thought of as a tiny software layer that tailors the
chip to a particular operating system.  
It runs in a special mode (PALmode) which has certain restrictions but it
uses the standard Alpha instruction set with just five extra instructions.
In this way, the Alpha chip can run such diverse operating systems as
Windows NT, OpenVMS, Digital Unix and, of course, Linux.
The PALcode that MILO uses (and therefore Linux itself)
is, like the rest of MILO, freeware.
It is derived from Digital's Evaluation Board software example Digital Unix
PALcode..
The differences between the different PALcodes are because of 
differences in address mapping and interrupt handling that
exist between the Alpha chips (21066 based systems have 
a different I/O map to 21064+2107x systems) and different
Alpha based systems.</P
><P
>For MILO to operate properly it needs to know what memory 
is available, where Linux will eventually be running from and it must be
able to allocate temporary memory for the Linux device drivers.
The code maintains a memory map that has entries for permanent and temporary
allocated pages.
As it boots, MILO uncompresses itself into the correct place in
physical memory.   When it passes control to the Linux kernel,
it reserves memory for the compressed version of itself, the PALcode
(which the kernel needs) and some data structures.
This leaves <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>most</TT
> of the memory in the system for Linux itself.</P
><P
>The final act of the memory code is to set up and turn on virtual addressing
so that the data structures that Linux expects to see are at the correct place
in virtual memory.</P
><P
>MILO contains video code that initialises and uses the video device
for the system.   
It will detect and use a VGA device if there is one, otherwise
it will try to use a TGA (21030) video device.   
Failing that, it will assume that there is no graphics device.
The BIOS emulation that the standard, pre-built, images include is
Digital's own BIOS emulation which supports most, if not all, of
the standard graphics devices available.</P
><P
>Linux device drivers live within the kernel and expect 
certain services from the kernel.  Some of these services are provided directly
by Linux kernel code, for example the interrupt handling and some is provided
by kernel look-alike routines.</P
><P
>MILO's most powerful
feature is that you can embed unaltered Linux device drivers into it.
This gives it the potential to support every device that Linux does.
MILO includes all of the block devices that are configured into the
Linux kernel that it is built against as well as a lot of the block device
code (for example, ll_rw_blk()).</P
><P
>MILO loads the Linux kernel from real file systems rather 
than  from boot blocks and other strange places.
It understands MSDOS, EXT2 and ISO9660 filesystems.
Gzip'd files are supported and these are recommended, particularly if
you are loading from floppy which is rather slow.
MILO recognises these by their <EM
>.gz</EM
> suffix.</P
><P
>Built into MILO is a simple keyboard driver which, together with
an equally simple video driver allows it to have a simple user interface.
That interface allows you to list file systems on configured devices, boot
Linux or run flash update utilities and set environment variables that 
control the system's booting.
Like LILO, you can pass arguments to the Kernel.</P
><P
>MILO must tell the Linux kernel what sort of system this is,
how much memory there is and which of that memory is free.
It does this using the HWRPB (Hardware Restart Parameter Block) data 
structure and associated memory cluster descriptions.
These are placed at the appropriate place in virtual memory just before
control is passed to the Linux kernel.</P

></H2
><P
> You build MILO 
seperately from the Kernel.  As MILO requires parts of the kernel
to function (for example interrupt handling) you must first 
configure and build the
kernel that matches with MILO that you want to build.  Mostly this
means building the kernel with the same version number.  
So, MILO-2.0.25.tar.gz will build against linux-2.0.25.tar.gz.  
MILO <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>may</TT
> build against a higher version of the kernel, but there 
again it may not.
Also, now that ELF shared libraries are fully supported, there are two
versions of the MILO sources.
To build under an ELF system you must first unpack the standard MILO sources
and then patch those sources with the same version numbered ELF patch.
In the remainder of this discussion,
I assume that your kernel sources and object files are stored in the
subtree at <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/usr/src/linux</TT
> and that the linux kernel has been fully
built with the command <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make boot</TT

>5.1. Loading MILO from the Windows NT ARC firmware</A
></H3
><P
>Most, if not all, Alpha AXP based systems include the Windows NT
ARC firmware and this is the prefered method of booting MILO and thus
Linux.  Once the Windows NT firmware is running and you have the correct
MILO image for your system, this method is completely generic.</P
><P
>The Windows NT ARC firmware is an environment in which programs can run
and make callbacks into the firmware to perform actions.  The Windows NT
OSLoader is a program that does exactly this.   Linload.exe is a 
much simpler program which does just enough to load and execute MILO.
It loads the appropriate image
file into memory at 0x00000000 and then makes a swap-PAL PALcall to
it.  
MILO, like Linux, uses a different PALcode to Windows NT which is why the
swap has to happen.
MILO relocates itself to 0x200000 and continues on through the
PALcode reset entry point as before.</P
><P
>Before you add a Linux boot option, 
you will need to copy linload.exe and the appropriate MILO that you
wish to load to someplace that the Windows NT ARC firmware can read from.

boots MILO when you are running the Windows NT ARC firmware, it only
allows you to set Debug Monitor or Windows NT ARC as boot options.</P

Also, it is important to set the host id of the SCSI controller
to a reasonable value.  By default, MILO will initialize it to the
highest possible value (7) which should normally work just fine.

> Some of the older versions of the Evaluation Board Debug Monitor (pre-version 2.0)
have a problem with DOS format flopies generated from Linux.
Usually, the Debug Monitor can load the first few sectors all right, but then goes
into an endless loop complaining about "bad sectors."  Apparently,
there is an incompatibility between the DOS file system as expected by
the Debug Monitor and the Linux implementation of DOSFS.  To make the
long story short: if you run into this problem, try using DOS to write
the floppy disk.  For example, if loading the file <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>MILO.cab</TT

doesn't work, use a DOS machine, insert the floppy and then do:</P

>MILO displays a long sequence of <TT

> and does not accept input.</EM
></P
><P
>This usually happens when MILO was built to use COM1 as a secondary console
device.   In such a case, MILO echo output to COM1 and accepts input from
there also.   This is great for debugging but not so great if you have
a device other than a terminal connected.
If this happens, disconnect the device or power it down until the Linux
kernel has booted.
Once Linux is up and running, everything will work as expected.</P
><P
><EM
>MILO complains that the kernel image has the wrong magic number</EM
></P
><P
> Older versions of MILO did not support the ELF object file format and so
could not recognise an ELF image and this might be your problem.
If this is reported, upgrade to the latest MILO that you can find.  All
2.0.20 and beyond MILOs support ELF.
On the other hand it could be that the image is indeed damaged.  You should
also note that MILO does not yet automatically distinquish between GZIP'd
and non-GZIP'd images; you need to add the ".gz" suffix to the file name.</P
><P
><EM
>MILO prints "...turning on virtual addressing and jumping to the Linux Kernel" and
nothing else happens</EM
></P
><P
>One obvious problem is that the kernel image is wrongly built or is built for another
Alpha system altogether.
Another is that the video board is a TGA (Zlxp) device and the kernel has been built
for a VGA device (or vice versa).
It is worth building the kernel to echo to COM1 and then connecting a terminal to
that serial port or retrying the kernel that came with the Linux distribution that you
installed.</P
><P
><EM
>MILO does not recognise the SCSI device</EM

><P
>The standard MILO images include as many device drivers as are known to be stable
for Alpha (as of now that includes the NCR 810, QLOGIC ISP, Buslogic and Adaptec 2940s
and 3940 cards).  If your card is not included, it may be that the driver is not stable
enough on an Alpha system yet.  Again, the latest MILO images are worth trying.  You
can tell which SCSI devices a MILO image has built into it by using the "show" command.</P
