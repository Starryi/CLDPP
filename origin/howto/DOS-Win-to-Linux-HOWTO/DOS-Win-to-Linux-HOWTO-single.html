<H1> From DOS/Windows to Linux HOWTO </H1>

<H2>By Guido Gonzato, <CODE>ggonza at tin.it</CODE></H2> Version 1.3.5. 31 August 2000.
<HR>
<EM>This HOWTO is dedicated to all the (soon to be former?) DOS and Windows
users who have decided to switch to Linux, the free UNIX clone. The purpose
of this document is to help the reader translate his or her knowledge of DOS
and Windows into the Linux environment, as well as providing hints on
exchanging files and resources between the two OSes.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Is Linux Right for You?</A>
</H2>


<P>Let's start politically correct. Throughout this document I say ``Linux'',
but I mean ``GNU/Linux''. Please go to 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html</A> to see why.</P>
<P>You want to switch from the DOS/Windows world to Linux? Good idea: Linux is
technically superior to DOS, Windows 9x and even Windows NT. But beware: it
might not be useful for you. These are the main differences between
DOS/Windows and Linux:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Windows runs Microsoft Office and lots of games; is perceived to be
easy to install and configure; is notoriously unstable; performs poorly;
crashes are frequent.
</LI>
<LI> Linux runs StarOffice, scores of technical software and fewer games;
can be tricky to install and configure; is rock solid; performs
impeccably; crashes are extremely rare.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>It's up to you to decide what you need. Furthermore, Linux gives you power,
but it takes some time to learn how to harness it. Thus, if mostly need
commercial sw, or if you don't feel like learning new commands and concepts,
you had better look elsewhere. Be aware that many newcomers give up because
of initial difficulties.</P>
<P>Work is underway to make Linux simpler to use, but <EM>don't expect to be
proficient with it unless you read a lot of documentation and use it at
least for a few months</EM>. Linux won't give you instant results. In spite
of these warnings, I'm 100% confident that if you are the right user
type you'll find in Linux your computer Nirvana. By the way, Linux + DOS/Win
can coexist happily on the same machine.</P>
<P>Prerequisites for this howto: I'll assume that</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> you know the basic DOS commands and concepts;
</LI>
<LI> Linux, possibly with X Window System (X11 for short), is properly
installed on your PC;
</LI>
<LI> your shell (the equivalent of <CODE>COMMAND.COM</CODE>) is <CODE>bash</CODE>.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Unless specified, all information in this work is aimed at bad ol' DOS.
There is information about Windows here and there, but bear in mind that
Windows and Linux are totally different, unlike DOS that is sort of a UNIX
poor relation.</P>
<P>Please also note that this work is neither a complete primer nor a
configuration guide!</P>
<P>The latest version of this document is available in several formats on 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org">http://www.linuxdoc.org</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 It Is. Tell Me More</A>
</H2>


<P>You installed Linux and the programs you needed on the PC. You gave yourself
an account (if not, type <CODE>adduser yourname</CODE> <EM>now!</EM>) and Linux
is running. You've just entered your name and password, and now you are
looking at the screen thinking: ``Well, now what?''</P>
<P>Now, don't despair. You're almost ready to do the same things you used to do
with DOS/Win, and many more. If you were running DOS/Win instead of Linux,
you would be doing some of the following tasks:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> running programs and creating, copying, viewing, deleting, printing,
renaming files;
</LI>
<LI> CD'ing, MD'ing, RD'ing, and DIR'ring your directories;
</LI>
<LI> formatting floppies and copying files from/to them;
</LI>
<LI> tailoring the system;
</LI>
<LI> surfing the Internet;
</LI>
<LI> writing .BAT files and programs in your favourite language;
</LI>
<LI> the remaining 1%.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You'll be glad to know that these tasks can be accomplished under Linux in a
fashion similar to DOS. Under DOS, the average user uses very few of the
100+ commands available: the same, up to a point, applies to Linux.</P>


<H3>Introductory Concepts</H3>


<P>The best way to learn something new is to get your feet wet. You are
strongly encouraged to experiment and play with Linux: unless you login as
``root'', you can't damage the system that way. A few points:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> first of all, how to quit Linux safely. If you see a text mode
screen, press &lt;CTRL-ALT-DEL&gt;, wait for the system to reboot, then
switch off the PC. If you are working under X Window System, press
&lt;CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE&gt; first, then &lt;CTRL-ALT-DEL&gt;. <EM>Never</EM>
switch off or reset the PC directly: this could damage the file system;
</LI>
<LI> unlike DOS or Windows, Linux has built-in security mechanisms. Files
and directories have permissions associated to them; as a result, some
cannot be accessed by the normal user; (see Section 
<A HREF="#Permissions">Permissions and Ownership</A>). DOS and Windows, on the contrary, will
let you wipe out the entire contents of your hard disk;
</LI>
<LI> there's a special user called ``root'': the system administrator,
with full power of life and death on the machine. If you work on your own
PC, you'll be root as well. Working as root is <EM>dangerous</EM>: any
mistake can seriously damage or destroy the system just like with
DOS/Windows. Don't work as root unless absolutely necessary;
</LI>
<LI> much of the complexity of Linux comes from its extreme
configurability: virtually every feature and every application can be
tailored through one or more configuration files. Complexity is the price to
pay for power;
</LI>
<LI> redirection and piping are a side DOS feature, a very inportant one
and much more powerful under Linux. Simple commands can be strung together
to accomplish complex tasks. I strongly suggest that you learn how to use
them.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H3>Getting Help</H3>


<P>There are many ways to get help with Linux. The most important are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <EM>reading the documentation</EM>---I mean it. Although the HOWTO
you are reading may serve as an introduction to Linux, there are several
books that you really should read: at least, Matt Welsh's ``Linux
Installation and Getting Started'' (
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/gs/gs.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/gs/gs.html</A>) and the Linux FAQ (
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ/index.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ/index.html</A>). Feel a guilty
conscience until you have read at least one of them;
</LI>
<LI> the documentation of the packages installed on the machine is often
found in subdirectories under /usr/doc/;
</LI>
<LI> to get some help about the ``internal commands'' of the shell, type
<CODE>help</CODE> or, better, <CODE>man bash</CODE> or <CODE>info bash</CODE>;
</LI>
<LI> to get help about a command, type <CODE>man command</CODE> that invokes
the manual (``man'') page of <CODE>command</CODE>. Alternatively, type <CODE>info
command</CODE> that invokes, if available, the info page pertinent of
<CODE>command</CODE>; info is a hypertext-based documentation system, perhaps
not intuitive to use at first. Finally, you may try <CODE>apropos command</CODE>
or <CODE>whatis command</CODE>. With all of these commands, press `q' to exit.
</LI>
<LI> finally, on the Internet: the right place for getting help is Usenet,
like 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.setup">news:comp.os.linux.setup</A>. Please don't email me for help,
because I'm quite overloaded.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Conventions</A>
</H2>


<P>Throughout this work, examples will often follow the following format:
<CODE>&lt;...></CODE> is a required argument, while <CODE>[...]</CODE> an optional one.
Example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ tar -tf &lt;file.tar> [> redir_file]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><CODE>file.tar</CODE> must be indicated, but redirection to <CODE>redir_file</CODE>
is optional.</P>
<P>``RMP'' means ``please Read the Man Pages for further information''. I can't
stress enough how important reading the documentation is.</P>
<P>When the prompt of a command example is <CODE>#</CODE>, the command can only
be performed by root.</P>

sections.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Meet bash</A></H2>


<P>Good news: with Linux you type much less at the prompt, because the
<CODE>bash</CODE> shell types for you whenever possible, and features cool line
editing capabilities. To begin with, the arrow-up key recalls previous
command lines; but there's more. Pressing &lt;TAB&gt; completes file and
directory names, so typing</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>
<P>is like typing</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>If there were ambiguities, as typing</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls /uTABloTABiTAB

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><CODE>bash</CODE> stops because it doesn't know if you mean
/usr/local/info or /usr/local/include. Supply more
characters then press &lt;TAB&gt; again.</P>
<P>Other useful key presses are &lt;ESC-BACKSPACE&gt; that deletes a word to
the left, while &lt;ESC-D&gt; deletes a word to the right; &lt;ESC-F&gt;
moves the cursor one word to the right, &lt;ESC-B&gt; to the left;
&lt;CTRL-A&gt; moves to the beginning of the line, &lt;CTRL-E&gt; to the
end. The &lt;ALT&gt; key is equivalent to &lt;ESC&gt;.</P>
<P>Enough for now. Once you get used to these shortcuts, you'll find the DOS
prompt very annoying...</P>


<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Files and Programs</A></H2>




<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Files: Preliminary Notions</A>
</H2>


<P>Linux has a structure of directories and files very similar to that of
DOS/Win. Files have filenames that obey special rules, are stored in
directories, some are executable, and among these most have command
switches. Moreover, you can use wildcard characters, redirection, and
piping. There are only a few minor differences:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> under DOS, file names are in the so-called 8.3 form; e.g.
<CODE>NOTENOUG.TXT</CODE>. Under Linux we can do better. If you installed Linux
using a file system like ext2 or umsdos, you can use longer filenames (up to
255 characters), and with more than one dot: for example,
<CODE>This_is.a.VERY_long.filename</CODE>. Please note that I used both upper
and lower case characters: in fact...
</LI>
<LI> upper and lower case characters in file names or commands are
different. Therefore, <CODE>FILENAME.tar.gz</CODE> and <CODE>filename.tar.gz</CODE>
are two different files. <CODE>ls</CODE> is a command, <CODE>LS</CODE> is a mistake;
</LI>
<LI> Windows users, beware when using long file names under Linux. If a
file name contains spaces (not recommended but possible), you must enclose
the file name in double quotes whenever you refer to it. For example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ # the following command makes a directory called "My old files"
$ mkdir "My old files"
$ ls
My old files    bin     tmp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Further, some characters shouldn't be used: some of those are
<CODE>!*$&amp;#</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> there are no compulsory extensions like .COM and .EXE for programs,
or .BAT for batch files. Executable files are marked by an asterisk
`<CODE>*</CODE>' at the end of their name when you issue the <CODE>ls -F</CODE>
command. For example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -F
I_am_a_dir/   cindy.jpg    cjpg*   letter_to_Joe    my_1st_script*  old~
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


The files <CODE>cjpg*</CODE> and <CODE>my_1st_script*</CODE> are executables, that
is ``programs''. Under DOS, backup files end in .BAK, while under Linux they
end with a tilde `<CODE>~</CODE>'. Further, a file whose name starts with
a dot is considered as hidden. Example: the file
<CODE>.I.am.a.hidden.file</CODE> won't show up after the <CODE>ls</CODE> command;
</LI>
<LI> DOS program switches are obtained with <CODE>/switch</CODE>, Linux
switches with <CODE>-switch</CODE> or <CODE>--switch</CODE>. Example: <CODE>dir
/s&lt;</CODE>tt> becomes <CODE>ls -R</CODE>. Note that many DOS programs, like
<CODE>PKZIP</CODE> or <CODE>ARJ</CODE>, use UNIX-style switches.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You can now jump to Section 
<A HREF="#Files">Translating Commands from DOS to Linux</A>, but if I were you I'd read on.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Symbolic Links</A>
</H2>


<P>UNIX has a type of file that doesn't exist under DOS: the symbolic link.
This can be thought of as a pointer to a file or to a directory, and can be
used instead of the file or directory it points to; it's similar to Windows
shortcuts. Examples of symbolic links are <CODE>/usr/X11</CODE>, which points to
<CODE>/usr/X11R6</CODE>; <CODE>/dev/modem</CODE>, which points to either
<CODE>/dev/ttyS0</CODE> or <CODE>/dev/ttyS1</CODE>.</P>
<P>To make a symbolic link:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ln -s &lt;file_or_dir> &lt;linkname>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ln -s /usr/doc/g77/DOC g77manual.txt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now you can refer to <CODE>g77manual.txt</CODE> instead of
<CODE>/usr/doc/g77/DOC</CODE>. Links appear like this in directory listings:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -F
g77manual.txt@
$ ls -l
(several things...)           g77manual.txt -> /usr/doc/g77/DOC
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="Permissions"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Permissions and Ownership </A>
</H2>


<P>DOS files and directories have the following attributes: A (archive), H
(hidden), R (read-only), and S (system). Only H and R make sense under
Linux: hidden files start with a dot, and for the R attribute, read on.</P>
<P>Under UNIX a file has ``permissions'' and an owner, who in turn belongs to a
``group''. Look at this example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -l /bin/ls
-rwxr-xr-x  1  root  bin  27281 Aug 15 1995 /bin/ls*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The first field contains the permissions of the file <CODE>/bin/ls</CODE>, which
belongs to root, group bin. Leaving the remaining information aside,
remember that <CODE>-rwxr-xr-x</CODE> means, from left to right:</P>
<P><CODE>-</CODE> is the file type (<CODE>-</CODE> = ordinary file, <CODE>d</CODE> =
directory, <CODE>l</CODE> = link, etc); <CODE>rwx</CODE> are the permissions for the
file owner (read, write, execute); <CODE>r-x</CODE> are the permissions for the
group of the file owner (read, execute); (I won't cover the concept of
group, you can survive without it as long as you're a beginner ;-)
<CODE>r-x</CODE> are the permissions for all other users (read, execute).</P>
<P>The directory <CODE>/bin</CODE> has permissions, too: see Section 
<A HREF="#Directories Permissions">Directories Permissions</A> for further
details. This is why you can't delete the file <CODE>/bin/ls</CODE> unless you
are root: you don't have the permission to do so. To change a file's
permissions, the command is:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ chmod &lt;whoXperm> &lt;file>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>where who is <CODE>u</CODE> (user, that is owner), <CODE>g</CODE> (group),
<CODE>o</CODE> (other), X is either <CODE>+</CODE> or <CODE>-</CODE>, perm is <CODE>r</CODE>
(read), <CODE>w</CODE> (write), or <CODE>x</CODE> (execute). Common examples of
<CODE>chmod</CODE> use are the following:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ chmod +x file
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>this sets the execute permission for the file.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ chmod go-rw file
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>this removes read and write permission for everyone but the owner.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ chmod ugo+rwx file
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>this gives everyone read, write, and execute permission. </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chmod +s file
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>this makes a so-called ``setuid'' or ``suid'' file---a file that everyone
can execute with its owner's privileges. Typically, you'll come across root
suid files; these are often important system files, like the X server.</P>
<P>A shorter way to refer to permissions is with digits: <CODE>rwxr-xr-x</CODE> can
be expressed as 755 (every letter corresponds to a bit: <CODE>---</CODE> is 0,
<CODE>--x</CODE> is 1, <CODE>-w-</CODE> is 2, <CODE>-wx</CODE> is 3...). It looks
difficult, but with a bit of practice you'll understand the concept. root,
being the superuser, can change everyone's file permissions. RMP.</P>

<P>That's all about running programs, but it's easy to go a step beyond. One of
the main reasons for using Linux is that it is a multitasking os---it can
run several programs (from now on, processes) at the same time. You can
launch processes in background and continue working straight away. Moreover,
Linux lets you have several sessions: it's like having many computers to
work on at once!</P>

<H2><A NAME="Floppies"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Floppies, Hard Disks, and the Like </A></H2>


<P>There are two ways to manage devices under Linux: the DOS way and the UNIX
way. Take your pick.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Managing Devices the DOS Way</A>
</H2>


<P>Most Linux distributions include the Mtools suite, a set of commands that
are perfectly equivalent to their DOS counterpart, but start with an `m':
i.e., <CODE>mformat</CODE>, <CODE>mdir</CODE>, <CODE>mdel</CODE>, <CODE>mmd</CODE>, and so
on. They can even preserve long file names, but not file permissions. If you
configure Mtools editing a file called /etc/mtools.conf (a
sample is provided in the distribution), you can also access the DOS/Win
partition, the CD--ROM, and the Zip drive. To format a fresh disk though,
the <CODE>mformat</CODE> command won't do. As root, you'll have to issue this
command beforehand: <CODE>fdformat /dev/fd0H1440</CODE>.</P>
<P>You can't access files on the floppy with a command like, say, <CODE>less
a:file.txt</CODE>! This is the disadvantage of the DOS way of accessing disks.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Managing Devices the UNIX Way</A>
</H2>


<P>UNIX has a different way to handle devices. There are no separate volumes
like A: or C:; a disk, be it a floppy or whatever, becomes part of the local
file system through an operation called ``mounting''. When you're done using
the disk, before extracting it you must ``unmount'' it.</P>
<P>Physically formatting a disk is one thing, making a file system on it is
another. The DOS command <CODE>FORMAT A:</CODE> does both things, but under
Linux there are separate commands. To format a floppy, see above; to create
a file system:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkfs -t ext2 -c /dev/fd0H1440
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can use <CODE>dos</CODE>, <CODE>vfat</CODE> (recommended) or other formats
instead of <CODE>ext2</CODE>. Once the disk is prepared, mount it with the
command</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>specifying the right file system if you don't use <CODE>ext2</CODE>. Now you can
address the files in the floppy using <CODE>/mnt</CODE> instead of A: or B:.
Examples:</P>

<P>When you've finished, before extracting the disk you <EM>must</EM> unmount
it with the command</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# umount /mnt

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Obviously, you have to <CODE>fdformat</CODE> and <CODE>mkfs</CODE> only unformatted
disks, not previously used ones. If you want to use the drive B:, refer to
<CODE>fd1H1440</CODE> and <CODE>fd1</CODE> instead of <CODE>fd0H1440</CODE> and
<CODE>fd0</CODE> in the examples above.</P>
<P>Needless to say, what applies to floppies also applies to other devices; for
instance, you may want to mount another hard disk or a CD--ROM drive. Here's
how to mount the CD--ROM:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This was the ``official'' way to mount your disks, but there's a trick in
store. Since it's a bit of a nuisance having to be root to mount a floppy or
a CD--ROM, every user can be allowed to mount them this way:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> as root, do the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkdir /mnt/floppy ; mkdir /mnt/cdrom
# chmod 777 /mnt/floppy /mnt/cd*
# # make sure that the CD-ROM device is right
# chmod 666 /dev/hdb ; chmod 666 /dev/fd*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI> add in /etc/fstab the following lines:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom  iso9660 ro,user,noauto          0       0
/dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy vfat    user,noauto             0       0

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>

</P>
<P>Now, to mount a DOS floppy and a CD--ROM:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mount /mnt/floppy
$ mount /mnt/cdrom
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>/mnt/floppy and /mnt/cdrom
can now be accessed by every user. Remember that allowing everyone to mount
disks this way is a gaping security hole, if you care.</P>
<P>Two useful commands are <CODE>df</CODE>, which gives information on the mounted
file systems, and <CODE>du dirname</CODE> which reports the disk space consumed
by the directory.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. What About Windows?</A></H2>


<P>The ``equivalent'' of Windows is the graphic system X Window System. Unlike
Windows or the Mac, X11 wasn't designed for ease of use or to look good, but
just to provide graphic facilities to UNIX workstations. These are the main
differences:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> while Windows looks and feels the same all over the world, X11 does
not: it's much more configurable. X11's overall look is given by a key
component called ``window manager'', of which you have a wide choice:
<CODE>fvwm</CODE>, basic but nice and memory efficient, <CODE>fvwm2-95</CODE>,
<CODE>Afterstep</CODE>, <CODE>WindowMaker</CODE>, <CODE>Enlightenment</CODE>, and many
more. The w.m. is usually invoked from <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE>;
</LI>
<LI> your w.m. can be configured so as a window acts as under, er,
Windows: you click on it and it comes to foreground. Another possibility is
that it comes to foreground when the mouse moves over it (``focus''). Also,
the placement of windows on the screen can be automatic or interactive: if a
strange frame appears instead of your program, left click where you want it
to appear;
</LI>
<LI> most features can be tailored editing one or more configuration
files. Read the docs of your w.m.: the configuration file can be
<CODE>.fvwmrc</CODE>, <CODE>.fvwm2rc95</CODE>, <CODE>.steprc</CODE>, etc. A sample
configuration file is typically found in
/etc/X11/window-manager-name/system.window-manager-name;
</LI>
<LI> X11 applications are written using special libraries (``widget
sets''); as several are available, applications look different. The most
basic ones are those that use the Athena widgets (2--D look; <CODE>xdvi</CODE>,
<CODE>xman</CODE>, <CODE>xcalc</CODE>); others use Motif (<CODE>netscape</CODE>), others
still use Tcl/Tk, Qt, Gtk, XForms, and what have you. Nearly all of these
libraries provide roughly the same look and feel as Windows;
</LI>
<LI> the feel, unfortunately, can be incoherent. For instance, if you
select a line of text using the mouse and press &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;, you'd
expect the line to disappear, right? This won't work with Athena--based
apps, but it does with other widget sets;
</LI>
<LI> how scrollbars and resizing work depends on the w.m. and the widget
set. Tip: if you find that the scrollbars don't behave as you would expect,
try using the central button or the two buttons together to move them;
</LI>
<LI> applications don't have an icon by default, but they can have many.
Most w.m. feature a menu you recall by clicking on the desktop (``root
window''); needless to say, the menu can be tailored. To change the root
window appearance, use <CODE>xsetroot</CODE> or <CODE>xloadimage</CODE>;
</LI>
<LI> the clipboard can only contain text, and behaves strange. Once you've
selected text, it's already copied to the clipboard: move elsewhere and
press the central button to paste it. There's an application,
<CODE>xclipboard</CODE>, that provides for multiple clipboard buffers;
</LI>
<LI> drag and drop is an option, and is only available if you use X11
applications and/or w.m. that support it.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>This said, good news for you. There are projects that aim at making X11 look
and behave as coherently as Windows. Gnome, 
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org">http://www.gnome.org</A>, and KDE, 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A>, are
simply awesome. Most likely your distribution uses either or both. You won't
regret your Windows desktop anymore!</P>

<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Networking: Concepts</A></H2>


<P>Not only is ``Dialup Networking'' available under Linux, it's also more
stable and quicker. The name of the game is ``PPP'', the protocol employed
for connecting to the Internet using modems. All you need is a tool that
dials out and makes the connection.</P>
<P>To retrieve your mail from the ISP's server you need a tool called ``email
fetcher'' that uses the POP protocol; when the mail is fetched it will
appear as though it had been directly delivered to your Linux box. You'll
then use a MUA (Mail User Agent) like <CODE>pine</CODE>, <CODE>mutt</CODE>,
<CODE>elm</CODE> or many others to manage it.</P>
<P>While under Windows the dialer is automatically invoked when you launch an
Internet application, under Linux the path is the other way round: you dial
first, then launch the application. A thing called <CODE>diald</CODE> provides
the usual behaviour. Installing and configuring dialup networking used to be
one of the most difficult things to do under Linux, but not anymore: please
consult the Configuration HOWTO.</P>
<P>Finally, a word about ``Network neighborhood'': you can make your Linux
workstation appear as Windows NT/9x in a local network of Windows machines!
The magic word is Samba: not the lively Brazilian dance, but an
implementation of the SMB protocol for Linux. Go to

<H2><A NAME="Shell Scripts"></A> <A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 Shell Scripts: .BAT Files on Steroids </A>
</H2>


<P>If you used .BAT files to create shortcuts of long command lines (I did a
lot), this goal can be attained by inserting appropriate alias lines (see
example above) in <CODE>profile</CODE> or <CODE>.bash_profile</CODE>. But if your
.BATs were more complicated, then you'll love the scripting language made
available by the shell: it's as powerful as good ol' QBasic, if not more. It
has variables, structures like while, for, case, if... then... else, and
lots of other features: it can be a good alternative to a ``real''
programming language.</P>
<P>To write a script---the equivalent of a .BAT file under DOS---all you have
to do is write a standard ASCII file containing the instructions, save it,
then make it executable with the command <CODE>chmod +x &lt;scriptfile></CODE>.
To execute it, type its name.</P>
<P>A word of warning. The system editor is called <CODE>vi</CODE>, and in my
experience most new users find it very difficult to use. I'm not going to
explain how to use it; please consult Matt Welsh's book or search for a
tutorial on the net. Suffice it here to say that:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to insert some text, type <CODE>i</CODE> then your text;</LI>
<LI> to delete characters, type &lt;ESC&gt; then <CODE>x</CODE>;</LI>
<LI> to quit <CODE>vi</CODE> whithout saving, type &lt;ESC&gt; then <CODE>:q!</CODE></LI>
<LI> to save and quit, type &lt;ESC&gt; then <CODE>:wq</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>A good beginner editor is <CODE>joe</CODE>: invoking it by typing <CODE>jstar</CODE>
you'll get the same key bindings as the DOS/Win editor. <CODE>jed</CODE> in
WordStar or IDE mode is even better. Please consult Section 
<A HREF="#Programs">Where to Find Applications</A> to see where to get these
editors.</P>
<P>Writing scripts under <CODE>bash</CODE> is such a vast subject it would require
a book by itself, and I will not delve into the topic any further. I'll just
give you an example of shell script, from which you can extract some basic
rules:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 C for Yourself</A>
</H2>


<P>Under UNIX, the system language is C, love it or hate it. Scores of other
languages (Java, FORTRAN, Pascal, Lisp, Basic, Perl, awk...) are also
available.</P>
<P>Taken for granted that you know C, here are a couple of guidelines for those
of you who have been spoilt by Turbo C++ or one of its DOS kin. Linux's C
compiler is called <CODE>gcc</CODE> and lacks all the bells and whistles that
usually accompany its DOS counterparts: no IDE, on-line help, integrated
debugger, etc. It's just a rough command-line compiler, very powerful and
efficient. To compile your standard <CODE>hello.c</CODE> you'll do:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gcc hello.c
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>which will create an executable file called <CODE>a.out</CODE>. To give the
executable a different name, do</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gcc -o hola hello.c
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To link a library against a program, add the switch -l&lt;libname&gt;. For
example, to link in the math library:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gcc -o mathprog mathprog.c -lm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(The <CODE>-l&lt;libname&gt;</CODE> switch forces <CODE>gcc</CODE> to link the
library <CODE>/usr/lib/lib&lt;libname&gt;.so</CODE>; so <CODE>-lm</CODE> links
<CODE>/usr/lib/libm.so</CODE>).</P>
<P>So far, so good. But when your prog is made of several source files, you'll
need to use the utility <CODE>make</CODE>. Let's suppose you have written an
expression parser: its source file is called <CODE>parser.c</CODE> and
#includes two header files, <CODE>parser.h</CODE> and <CODE>xy.h</CODE>. Then
you want to use the routines in <CODE>parser.c</CODE> in a program, say,
<CODE>calc.c</CODE>, which in turn #includes <CODE>parser.h</CODE>. What a mess!
What do you have to do to compile <CODE>calc.c</CODE>?</P>
<P>You'll have to write a so-called <CODE>Makefile</CODE>, which teaches the
compiler the dependencies between sources and objects files. In our example:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
# This is Makefile, used to compile calc.c
# Press the &lt;TAB> key where indicated!

calc: calc.o parser.o
&lt;TAB>gcc -o calc calc.o parser.o -lm
# calc depends on two object files: calc.o and parser.o

calc.o: calc.c parser.h
&lt;TAB>gcc -c calc.c
# calc.o depends on two source files

parser.o:  parser.c parser.h xy.h
&lt;TAB>gcc -c parser.c
# parser.o depends on three source files

# end of Makefile.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Save this file as <CODE>Makefile</CODE> and type <CODE>make</CODE> to compile your
program; alternatively, save it as <CODE>calc.mak</CODE> and type <CODE>make -f
calc.mak</CODE>, and of course RMP. You can invoke some help about the C
functions, that are covered by man pages, section 3; for example,</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ man 3 printf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To debug your programs, use <CODE>gdb</CODE>. <CODE>info gdb</CODE> to learn how to
use it.</P>
<P>There are lots of libraries available; among the first you may want to use
are <CODE>ncurses</CODE> (textmode effects), and <CODE>svgalib</CODE> (console
graphics). Many editors can act as an IDE; <CODE>emacs</CODE> and <CODE>jed</CODE>,
for instance, also feature syntax highlighting, automatic indent, and so on.
Alternatively, get the package <CODE>rhide</CODE> from 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/devel/debuggers/">ftp://metalab.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/devel/debuggers/</A>. It's a Borland IDE

<P>Under UNIX there are some widely used applications to archive and compress

<H2><A NAME="Install"></A> <A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Installing Applications </A>
</H2>


<P>First of all: installing packages is root's work. Most Linux applications
are distributed as a <CODE>.tar.gz</CODE> archive, which typically will contain
a directory aptly named containing files and/or subdirectories. A good rule
is to install these packages from <CODE>/usr/local</CODE> with the command</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tar zxf &lt;archive.tar.gz>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>reading then the README or INSTALL file. In most cases, the application is
distributed in source, which you'll have to compile; often, typing
<CODE>make</CODE> then <CODE>make install</CODE> will suffice. If the archive
contains a <CODE>configure</CODE> script, run it first. Obviously, you'll need
the <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>g++</CODE> compiler.</P>
<P>Other archives have to be unpacked from /; this is the case
with Slackware's <CODE>.tgz</CODE> archives. Other archives contain the files
but not a subdirectory - careful not to mess things up! Always list the
contents of the archive before installing it.</P>
<P>Debian and Red Hat have their own archive format; respectively,
<CODE>.deb</CODE> and <CODE>.rpm</CODE>. The latter is widely used by many
distributions; to install an <CODE>rpm</CODE> package, type</P>

<P>Linux can do an awful lot of things that were cumbersome, difficult or
impossible do to with DOS/Windows. Here's a short list that may whet your
appetite:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>at</CODE> allows you to run programs at a specified time;
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>awk</CODE> is a simple yet powerful language to manipulate data
files (and not only). For example, being <CODE>data.dat</CODE> your multi field
data file,

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ awk '$2 ~ "abc" {print $1, "\t", $4}' data.dat
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


prints out fields 1 and 4 of every line in <CODE>data.dat</CODE> whose second
field contains ``abc''.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>cron</CODE> is useful to perform tasks periodically, at specified
date and time. Type <CODE>man 5 crontab</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>file &lt;filename&gt;</CODE> tells you what <CODE>filename</CODE> is
(ASCII text, executable, archive, etc.);
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>find</CODE> (see also Section 
<A HREF="#Directories: Trans">Directories: Translating Commands</A>) is one of the most powerful and
useful commands. It's used to find files that match several characteristics
and perform actions on them. General use of <CODE>find</CODE> is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ find &lt;directory> &lt;expression>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


where &lt;expression&gt; includes search criteria and actions. Examples:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ find . -type l -exec ls -l {} \;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


finds all the files that are symbolic links and shows what they point to.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ find / -name "*.old" -ok rm {} \;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


finds all the files matching the pattern and deletes them, asking for your
permission first.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ find . -perm +111
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


finds all the files whose permissions match 111 (executable).

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ find . -user root
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


finds all the files that belong to root. Lots of possibilities here---RMP.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>grep</CODE> finds text patterns in files. For example,

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ grep -l "geology" *.tex
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


lists the files *.tex that contain the word ``geology''. The variant
<CODE>zgrep</CODE> works on gzipped files. RMP;
</LI>
<LI> <B>regular expressions</B> are a complex but darn powerful way of
performing search operations on text. For example,
<CODE>^a[^a-m]X{4,}txt$</CODE> matches a line that starts with `a', followed by
any character except those in the interval a-m, followed by 4 or more `X',
and ends in `txt'. You use regular expressions with advanced editors,
<CODE>less</CODE>, and many other applications. <CODE>man grep</CODE> for an
introduction.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>script &lt;script_file&gt;</CODE> dumps the screen contents on
<CODE>script_file</CODE> until you issue the command <CODE>exit</CODE>. Useful for
debugging;
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>sudo</CODE> allows users to perform some of root's tasks (e.g.
formatting and mounting disks; RMP);
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>uname -a</CODE> gives you info about your system;
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>zcat</CODE> and <CODE>zless</CODE> are useful for browsing and piping
gzipped files without decompressing them. For example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ zless textfile.gz
$ zcat textfile.gz | lpr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI> The following commands often come in handy: <CODE>bc, cal, chsh, cmp,
cut, fmt, head, hexdump, nl, passwd, printf, sort, split, strings, tac,
tail, tee, touch, uniq, w, wall, wc, whereis, write, xargs, znew.</CODE> RMP.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.9">11.9 Converting Files</A>
</H2>


<P>If you need to exchange text files between DOS/Win and Linux, be aware of
the ``end of line'' problem. Under DOS, each line of text ends with CR/LF
(that is, ASCII 13 + ASCII 10), with LF under Linux. If you edit a DOS text
file under Linux, each line will likely end with a strange--looking `M'
character; a Linux text file under DOS will appear as a kilometric single
line with no paragraphs. There are a couple of tools, <CODE>dos2unix</CODE> and
<CODE>unix2dos</CODE>, to convert the files.</P>
<P>If your text--only files contain accented characters, make sure they are
made under Windows (with Notepad) and not under plain DOS; otherwise, all
accented characters will be screwed up.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss11.10">11.10 Free Office Suites</A>
</H2>


<P>Yes, you can have for free what would otherwise cost a lot of money!</P>
<P>StarOffice (
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/staroffice">http://www.sun.com/staroffice</A>.) is currently the
only choice, though Koffice is down the pipeline (
<A HREF="http://www.koffice.org">http://www.koffice.org</A>). StarOffice is big and slow, but very good
anyway: it offers a lot of functionality not found in Microsoft Office. It
can also read and write Word and Excel files, although the conversion isn't
always perfect.</P>
<P>Another good package is Corel WordPerfect, a free edition of which is
available for download. Need I say more? Go fetch it: 
<A HREF="http://www.corel.com">http://www.corel.com</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="The End"></A> <A NAME="s12">12. The End, for Now </A></H2>


<P>Congratulations! You have now grasped a little bit of UNIX and are ready to
start working. Remember that your knowledge of the system is still limited,
and that you are expected to do more practice with Linux to use it
comfortably. But if all you had to do was get a bunch of applications and
start working with them, what I included here is enough.</P>
<P>I'm sure you'll enjoy using Linux and will keep learning more about
it---everybody does. I bet, too, that you'll never go back to DOS/Win! I
hope I made myself understood and did a good service to my 3 or 4 readers.</P>
