>The script <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.FDISK"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.fdisk</TT

> scans a hard drive for partition information, and saves it in four files. The first is an executable script, called <A

><TT

>make.dev.x</TT

HREF="thescripts.html#MOUNT.DEV.HDA"
><TT

CLASS="COMMAND"

HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.FDISK"
><TT

CLASS="FILENAME"
>dev.xy</TT
>, where x is the drive's device name (e.g. sdc, hda) and y is the partition number. The boot sector is the first sector, 512 bytes, of the partition. This sector is restored at the same time the partitions are rebuilt, in the script <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.DEV.HDA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.dev.hda</TT
></A
>.</P
><P
>Fortunately, the price of hard drives is plummeting almost as fast as the public's trust in politicians after an election. So it is good that the output files are text, and allow hand editing. That's the most difficult but most flexible way to rebuild on a larger replacement drive. (See the <A
HREF="whatnow.html#TODO"
>To Do list</A
>.)</P
><P
>Other metadata are preserved by the script <A
HREF="thescripts.html#SAVE.METADATA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>save.metadata</TT
></A
>. The script saves the partition information in the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fdisk.hda</TT
> in the root of the ZIP disk. It is a good idea to print this file and your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> so that you have hard copy should you ever have to restore the partition data manually. You can save a tree by toggling between two virtual consoles, running <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fdisk</B
> in one and catting <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/fdisk.hda</TT
> as needed. However, doing so is error prone.</P
><P
>You will also want to preserve files relevant to your restoration method. For example, if you use NFS to save your data, you will need to preserve hosts.allow, hosts.deny, exports, etc. Also, if you are using any network-backed restoration process, such as Amanda or Quick Restore, you will need to preserve networking files like HOSTNAME, hosts, etc. and the relevant software tree.</P
><P
>The simplest way to handle these and similar questions is to preserve the entire <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
> directory.</P
><P
