    using IBM DB2® Express-C 9 on a Linux® distribution. The goal is
    to include as many distributions as possible, on both 32&#8211;bit and
    64&#8211;bit architectures, however both hardware and time resources are
    constrained, so if you come across a distribution/architecture combination
    that isn't covered in here or if you encounter a problem that isn't
    addressed, send a note to db2howto@gmail.com and I'll try to help verify or
    resolve your issue and add the information here.</p><p>The information found in this document is based on personal experiences
    installing and configuring IBM DB2 9 Express-C.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm27"></a>1.2. Disclaimer</h3></div></div></div><p>No liability for the contents of this document is accepted.
