    he is involved in technical marketing for the DB2 Express-C product,
    developing technical documentation and evangelizing DB2 Express-C.
    Before that, he was the technical team lead for the DB2 Information
    Development department, and the writer responsible for the DB2 SQL
    Reference manual. His free time is spent mainly typing on computers,
    thinking about how much nicer it would be to watch a movie or to be
    sailing.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="whyexpc9"></a>2. Why DB2 Express-C 9?</h2></div></div></div><p>In March of 2006, IBM made a strategic decision to release their best
  of breed DB2 database as freely available software. It is important to
  realize that the DB2 Express-C edition is a gratis, "free as in beer" software product,
  meaning that, although the source code is not distributed as part of the product,
  this edition of DB2 is freely useable and full featured, not "crippled" in any way.
  </p><p>A number of other large enterprise class databases have also opted to
  release versions of their software, but DB2 Express-C is the only one that
  places no restrictions on the size or number of the databases that can be
  created. The one restriction to using DB2 Express-C is that it can only be run
  on systems with 2 physical CPUs and 4 GB of RAM. Since the majority of
  developers and small businesses run systems within these specifications, DB2
  Express-C makes a great choice for developers and business applications.
  In this HOWTO, all testing and discussions are based on machines that fall
  within these system specifications.
  </p><p>With DB2 Express-C, you get a free, low maintenance database application
  that is easy to install and run, with a number of powerful features, as well
  as performance typically found in much more expensive enterprise-level
  database software.
  </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="whatsinexpc9"></a>3. What's included in DB2 Express-C 9</h2></div></div></div><p>
  Feature-wise, what's included in the DB2 Express-C download is impressive. To
  start with, you get the same database engine code as the full enterprise-level
  database server, with no connection restrictions. Also included is the full
  suite of commmand line and graphical user tools to help adminster databases
  and develop database applications. You also get autonomic maintenance features,
  along with development APIs and drivers for C/C++, Java, PHP, Perl and Ruby on
  Rails.
  </p><p>The cherry on top is the inclusion of IBM's new pureXML&#8482;
  hybrid technology that allows you to store XML data natively inside the
  database, without any shredding or decomposition of the data. This is a
  feature that is typically an add-on to the other editions of DB2 9, and IBM is
  giving it to users of the Express-C edition completely free of charge. Sometimes
  it's good to be the little guy.  
  </p><p>There are three architecture choices available for Linux: the 32-bit version, the
  64-bit version, and the PowerPC version, giving you the option of using the best
  hardware you have available for your DB2 installation.

      In DB2 9, product documentation is accessed through the DB2 Information
      Center, either via the web, or as a local system installation. To install
      this locally requires at least 100 MB when installing the core English
      language files. Additional space is required for other additional languages. If
      disk space is an issue, you can configure DB2 to access the Information
      Center from the Web. More detail about this is provided in

                </p><pre class="screen">rpm -qa compat-libstdc++*</pre><p>
            </p><p>To install these packages on Red Hat Linux, use the Red Hat
            Linux installation CDs and the <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span> command, or
            the <span class="command"><strong>up2date</strong></span> utility. For example, to install
            the compat-libstdc++ package from the Red Hat Linux CD, mount the
            Red Hat Linux CD #4, and enter this command as root:
            </p><pre class="screen">rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/compat-libstdc++-296-2.96-132.7.2.i386.rpm</pre><p>
            To install using the up2date package, run this command as root:
            </p><pre class="screen">up2date compat-libstdc++</pre><p>
            </p><p>To install these packages on SUSE Linux, you can also use
            <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span> or use the handy YaST (Yet another Setup
            Tool) utility. For example, to install nfs-utils on SLES 9

      db2/ -|        (* installation and licensing files *)
      doc/ -|        (* install instructions and release notes *)</pre><p>
    </p><p>You can use three methods to install DB2:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span> utility</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>db2_install</strong></span> utility</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a DB2 response file</p></li></ul></div><p>
      Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of method
      depends on your level of expertise and type of environment, but in
      general, if a graphical interface is available, using
      <span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span> is recommended for ease of installation.
    </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm243"></a>5.1.1. db2setup installation</h4></div></div></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span> command starts the DB2 Launchpad, a
      graphical tool that configures and organizes the DB2 installation. It lays
      down the DB2 filesets, creates and configures DB2 instances, users and
      groups, communications, the administration database used by the DB2 Tools,
      and sets up notification processes. The DB2 Launchpad also allows
      you to create a response file for replicating a particular setup to other
      systems.</p><p>Using <span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span> is the best method for less
      experienced users, because most of the configuration is automatically
      performed during the installation. As mentioned previously, you require an
      X Window System capable of rendering a graphical user interface to use
      <span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span> successfully.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm250"></a>5.1.2. db2_install installation</h4></div></div></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>db2_install</strong></span> command script installs all DB2
      packages on your Linux system. This method is reliable and commonly used
      by expert users for installing DB2 on larger, more complex systems.
      However, tasks such as setting up users and groups, creating instances,
      tools catalog database creation, and notification setup need to be
      performed manually after the installation is completed.</p><p>One limitation to <span class="command"><strong>db2_install</strong></span> is that it only
      installs user assistance (like help, messages, and tool interfaces) in
      English, whereas <span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span> supports the installation of
      additional languages. Also, a <span class="command"><strong>db2_install</strong></span>
      installation can take longer (because of the higher number of manual
      configuration tasks); it requires a higher level of knowledge and skill,
      and it cannot be used to create response files.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm258"></a>5.1.3. Response file installation</h4></div></div></div><p>A response file can be created using the DB2 Setup Wizard or by
      editing an existing DB2 response (.rsp) file. It allows you to install DB2
      across multiple machines with consistent installation and configuration
      settings. A response file installation is fast, because it bypasses the
      graphical wizard configuration. Another advantage of
      using a response file instead of the <span class="command"><strong>db2_install</strong></span>
      command is that it creates a Database Administration Server (DAS) on each
      machine, while with
      <span class="command"><strong>db2_install</strong></span> the DAS must be created manually after
      installation.</p><p>There is a sample response file (db2exp.rsp) included on the installation image
      that can be modified and used to install DB2, configure users, create
      instances, set up notification, create the tools catalog, and configure a
      large number of database management parameters. This is the quickest
      installation method if you already have all the information you need.
      Unlike
      <span class="command"><strong>db2setup</strong></span>, the response file installation is not
      interactive, and it takes longer to prepare the response file initially.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm265"></a>5.2. User and group setup</h3></div></div></div><p>DB2 requires user IDs and groups for database authentication.

    connectivity to your DB2 server, you must open up TCP and UDP access to

      click the <span class="command"><strong>Show commercial applications</strong></span> checkbox.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the <span class="command"><strong>Search</strong></span> bar, type "DB2" and hit the Enter
        key.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>DB2 Express should show up as the only result. If you don't see
        it, make sure that Synaptic is displaying <span class="command"><strong>All

        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Enable the <span class="command"><strong>dapper-commercial</strong></span> channel if

        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Click "<span class="command"><strong>Apply</strong></span>".
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
    After hitting the "<span class="command"><strong>Apply</strong></span>" button, Synaptic will
    download the DB2 Express-C package, along with a few dependent libraries,
    then unpack and install the package and finally configure the DB2 users and
    default instance.

        say "No" to the dialog that asks if you want to start the service now.
        Click <span class="command"><strong>Quit</strong></span>. The script will now run at your next boot and
        start up all DB2 instances.
        </p><p>The only other way to resolve the problem is to manually
        start the instances after a reboot with <span class="command"><strong>db2start</strong></span> (as
        the instance owner) and <span class="command"><strong>db2admin start</strong></span> (as the DAS
        owner). Once DB2 Express-C has passed the validation process for Ubuntu

    issue DB2 commands and SQL statements from the command line.</p><p>If this is your first time using DB2 , I would suggest creating
    the DB2 sample database. The sample database is used
    throughout the DB2 documentation and is required by most of the sample
    applications.</p><p>To create the sample database, you can either select the <span class="command"><strong>Create
    the SAMPLE database</strong></span> option from the DB2 First Steps launchpad, or by
    issuing the <span class="command"><strong>db2sampl</strong></span> command from the command line.</p><p>Before you can issue an SQL statement, you have to connect to a
    database. To connect to a database, enter the command:
      </p><pre class="screen">db2 CONNECT TO database USER userID USING password</pre><p>
    </p><p>To connect to a database, and have DB2 prompt you for the password,
    issue the command:
      </p><pre class="screen">db2 CONNECT TO database USER userID</pre><p>
    </p><p>To connect to a database using the default user ID, issue the
    command:
      </p><pre class="screen">db2 CONNECT TO database</pre><p>
    </p><p>Once you have connected to a database, you can then issue SQL
    statements or DB2 commands against that database. For example, to select
    all of the rows from the EMPLOYEE table in the SAMPLE database, issue
    this command:
      </p><pre class="screen">db2 "SELECT * FROM employee"</pre><p>
    </p><p>You can avoid typing db2 as the prefix for every SQL statement and
    DB2 command by issuing DB2 commands using the Command Line Processor
    (CLP). To start the CLP, issue the <span class="command"><strong>db2</strong></span> command by itself
    from a Linux command line terminal. DB2 provides the following prompt:
      </p><pre class="screen">You can issue database manager commands and SQL statements
from the command prompt. For example:
  db2 =&gt; connect to sample
  db2 =&gt; bind sample.bnd

For general help, type: ?. 
For command help, type: ? command, where command can be 
the first few keywords of a database manager command. For example: 
? CATALOG DATABASE for help on the CATALOG DATABASE command
? CATALOG          for help on all of the CATALOG commands. 

To exit db2 interactive mode, type QUIT at the command prompt. Outside 
interactive mode, all commands must be prefixed with 'db2'. 
To list the current command option settings, type LIST COMMAND OPTIONS. 

For more detailed help, refer to the Online Reference Manual.

    </p><p>Some users prefer to avoid the CLP because it prevents using the
    command line history features of the shell.</p><p>Some users claim that running the CLP within an Emacs shell gives
    them the best of both worlds: they get command line history, and they
    don't have to escape commands that contain lots of quotation marks and
    brackets, but your mileage may vary.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tests"></a>21. Installation and operation test plan</h2></div></div></div><p></p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1059"></a>21.1. DB2 Express-C installation tests</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Log on as root (or gain root access through a terminal if a root

    other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
    or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
    modifications made by others.</p><p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</p><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
    can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
    reference.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1320"></a>23.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h3></div></div></div><p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any
    medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
    can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
    grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
    that work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
    refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.</p><p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</p><p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
    a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</p><p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
    allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
    Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.</p><p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
    says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
    Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
    words.</p><p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
    is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
    that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p><p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
    HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.</p><p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
    near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</p><p>A section "Entitled XYZ"
    means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely
    XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in
    another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
    below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or
    "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify
    the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to
    this definition.</p><p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
    which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1332"></a>23.3. VERBATIM COPYING</h3></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
    the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
    of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
    3.</p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
    and you may publicly display copies.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1336"></a>23.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h3></div></div></div><p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
    have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
    to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
    satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.</p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
    Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
    network-using public has access to download using public-standard
    network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
    added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
    prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
    to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
    stated location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
    of that edition to the public.</p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1342"></a>23.5. MODIFICATIONS</h3></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
    under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
    release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
    Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
    distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
    possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
    Modified Version:

          stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
          public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
          network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
          based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a
          network location for a work that was published at least four years
          before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
          version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
          substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
          dedications given therein.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
          are not considered part of the section titles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may

    </p><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied
    from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
    sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
    Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be
    distinct from any other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
    example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
    organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by)
    any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
    cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you
    are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the
    old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
    old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
    endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1380"></a>23.6. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h3></div></div></div><p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
    provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
    Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
    all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If
    there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
    contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of
    it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that
    section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the
    section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
    likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections
    Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled
    "Endorsements".</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1385"></a>23.7. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h3></div></div></div><p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
    documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of
    this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
    distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of
    this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1389"></a>23.8. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h3></div></div></div><p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
    from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
    compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
    Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
    other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
    the Document.</p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
    entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on
    printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1393"></a>23.9. TRANSLATION</h3></div></div></div><p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
    from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
    all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
    Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all
    the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
    that you also include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p><p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
    Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1397"></a>23.10. TERMINATION</h3></div></div></div><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
    except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
    have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
    their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1400"></a>23.11. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h3></div></div></div><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
    GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
    "or any laterversion" applies to it, you have the option of following the
    terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
    version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this
    License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="trademarks"></a>24. Trademarks</h2></div></div></div><p>DB2, IBM, pureXML, iSeries, pSeries, zSeries, and z/OS are trademarks or
