If you want to boot your operating system from the drive you are about
to partition, you will need:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A primary partition</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>One or more swap partitions</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Zero or more primary/logical partitions</p></li></ul></div><p>

	Your boot partition ought to be a primary partition, not a logical
	partition. This will ease recovery in case of disaster, but it is
	not technically necessary. It must be of type
	<code class="literal">0x83</code> "Linux native". If you are using a version
	of <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>lilo</strong></span></a> before 21-3 (ie, from the 1990s), your boot partition must be
	contained within the first 1024 cylinders of the drive. (Typically,
	the boot partition need only contain the kernel image.)
</p><p>
	If you have more than one boot partition (from other OSs, for
	example,) keep them all in the first 1024 cylinders
	(<span class="emphasis"><em>All</em></span> DOS partitions must be within the first
	1024).  If you are using a modern version of lilo, or a means other
	than lilo to load your kernel (for example, a boot disk or the
	<span class="command"><strong>LOADLIN.EXE</strong></span> MS-DOS based Linux loader), the
	partition can be anywhere. See the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Large-Disk-HOWTO.html" target="_top">Large-disk</a>

Unless you swap to files (see <a class="xref" href="ar01s09.html#swapfiles" title="9.2. Swap Files">Section 9.2, &#8220;Swap Files&#8221;</a>) you will
need a dedicated swap partition. It must be of type
<code class="literal">0x82</code> "Linux swap". It may be positioned anywhere on
the disk (but see <a class="xref" href="ar01s04.html#SwapPlacement" title="4.4.3. Where should I put my swap space?">Section 4.4.3, &#8220;Where should I put my swap space?&#8221;</a>). Either a primary or
logical partition can be used for swap. More than one swap partition can
exist on a drive. 8 total (across drives) are permitted. See notes on
swap size below (<a class="xref" href="ar01s04.html#SwapSize" title="4.4. Swap Partitions">Section 4.4, &#8220;Swap Partitions&#8221;</a>).
</p></dd><dt><a name="logical-definition"></a><span class="term">Logical Partition:</span></dt><dd><p>
A single primary partition must be used as a container (extended
partition) for the logical partitions. The extended partition can go
anywhere on the disk. The logical partitions must be contiguous, but
needn't fill the extended partition.

Everything in your linux file system can go in the same (single)
partition. However, there are circumstances when you may want to
restrict the growth of certain file systems. For example, if your mail
spool was in the same partition as your root fs and it filled the
remaining space in the partition, your computer would basically
hang.
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">/var</code></span></dt><dd><p>This fs contains spool directories such as those for mail and 
	  printing. In addition, it contains the error log
	  directory. If your machine is a server and develops a
	  chronic error, those msgs can fill the partition. Server
	  computers ought to have /var in a different partition than
	  /.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">/usr</code></span></dt><dd><p>This is where most executable binaries go. In addition, the

	  /.
     </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">/home</code></span></dt><dd><p>This is where users home directories go. If you do not impose

considerations and to avoid external fragmentation <a class="xref" href="ar01s10.html#fragmentation" title="10.4. Some facts about file systems and fragmentation">Section 10.4, &#8220;Some facts about file systems and fragmentation&#8221;</a>
from different file lifetimes.
</p><p>Files have lifetimes. After a file has been created, it will
remain some time on the system and then be removed. File
lifetime varies greatly throughout the system and is partly
dependent on the pathname of the file. For example, files in
<code class="filename">/bin</code>, <code class="filename">/sbin</code>, <code class="filename">/usr/sbin</code>, <code class="filename">/usr/bin</code> and similar directories are
likely to have a very long lifetime: many months and above.
Files in <code class="filename">/home</code> are likely to have a medium lifetime: several
weeks or so. File in <code class="filename">/var</code> are usually short lived: Almost no
file in <code class="filename">/var/spool/news</code> will remain longer than a few days,
files in <code class="filename">/var/spool/lpd</code> measure their lifetime in minutes or
less.
</p><p>
	For backup it is useful if the amount of daily backup is smaller
	than the capacity of a single backup medium. A daily backup can be a
	complete backup or an incremental backup.
</p><p>
	You can decide to keep your partition sizes small enough that they
	fit completely onto one backup medium (choose daily full backups).
	In any case a partition should be small enough that its daily delta
	(all modified files) fits onto one backup medium (choose incremental
	backup and expect to change backup media for the weekly/monthly full
	dump - no unattended operation possible).
</p><p>
	Your backup strategy depends on that decision.
</p><p>
	When planning and buying disk space, remember to set aside a
	sufficient amount of money for backup! Unbackuped data is worthless!
	Data reproduction costs are much higher than backup costs for
	virtually everyone!
</p><p>
	For performance it is useful to keep files of different lifetimes on
	different partitions. This way the short lived files on the news
	partition may be fragmented very heavily. This has no impact on the
	performance of the <code class="filename">/</code> or
	<code class="filename">/home</code> partition.

Conventional wisdom creates swap space equal to the amount of RAM. </p><p>
	But keep in mind that this is just a rule of thumb. It is easily
	possible to create scenarios where programs have extremely large or
	extremely small working sets (see <a class="xref" href="ar01s03.html#swap-partitions" title="3.5. Swap Partitions">Section 3.5, &#8220;Swap Partitions&#8221;</a>). 
	For example, a simulation program with
	a large data set that is accessed in a very random fashion would
	have almost no noticeable locality of reference in its data segment,
	so its working set would be quite large.
</p><p>
	On the other hand, a graphics program with many simultaneously
	opened JPEGs, all but one iconified, would have a very large data
	segment. But image transformations are all done on one single image,
	most of the memory occupied by the program is not accessed. The same
	is true for an editor with many editor windows where only one window
	is being modified at a time. These programs have - if they are
	designed properly - a very high locality of reference and large
	parts of them can be kept swapped out without too severe performance
	impact. A user who never quits programs once launched would
	want a lot of swap space for the same reason.
</p><p>
	Servers typically are configured with more swap space than their
	desktop counterparts. Even though a given amount of swap is
	sufficient for its operations, the server might come under transient
	heavy loads which cause it to page out at a high rate. Some
	administrators prefer this to the server crashing altogether. In
	these cases, swap might be several times the size of ram.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="max_swap_size"></a>4.4.2. How large <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> my swap space be?</h4></div></div></div><p>
		Currently, the maximum size of a swap partition is
		architecture-dependent. For i386, m68k, ARM and PowerPC, it is
		"officially" 2Gb. It is 128Gb on alpha, 1Gb on sparc, and 3Tb on
		sparc64. An opteron on the 2.6 kernel can write to a 16 Tb swap
		partition. For linux kernels 2.1 and earlier, the limit is
		128Mb. The partition may be larger than 128 MB, but excess space
		is never used. If you want more than 128 MB of swap for a 2.1
		and earlier kernel, you have to create multiple swap partitions
		(8 max). After 2.4, 32 swap areas are "officially" possible. See
		setting up swap for details.
</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>footnote:</em></span> 
	"official" max swap size: With kernel 2.4, the limit is 64 swap spaces at a
	maximum of 64Gb each, although this is not reflected in the man page
	for <span class="command"><strong>mkswap</strong></span>. With the 64 bit opteron on the 2.6 kernel, 128 swap
	areas are permitted, each a whopping 16 Tb! (thanks to Peter Chubb
	for the calculation)
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="SwapPlacement"></a>4.4.3. Where should I put my swap space?</h4></div></div></div><p>
The short answer is anywhere is fine. However, if you are
interested in extracting as much speed as possible, there are
two basic strategies (other than buying more RAM).
</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Split the swap space across multiple drives, or at least on the
			    drive you write to least.
           </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Put each swap partition on the outer tracks.
           </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p> 
	Here are the considerations:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
		If you have a disk with many heads and one with less heads and
		both are identical in other parameters, the disk with many heads
		will be faster. Reading data from different heads is fast, since
		it is purely electronic. Reading data from different tracks is
		slow, since it involves physically moving the head.
	</p><p>
		It follows then that writing swap on a separate drive will be
		faster than moving the head back and forth on a single drive.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Placement</em></span>: 
		Older disks have the same number of sectors on all tracks. With
		these disks it will be fastest to put your swap in the middle of
		the disks, assuming that your disk head will move from a random
		track towards the swap area.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> 
		Newer disks use ZBR (zone bit recording). They have more sectors
		on the outer tracks. With a constant number of rpms, this yields
		a far greater performance on the outer tracks than on the inner
		ones. Put your swap on the fast tracks. (In general,
		low-numbered cylinders are associated low partition numbers.
		However, see Kristian's more recent <a class="ulink" href="http://lissot.net/partition/mapping.html" target="_top">comments</a>
		on this issue. -Tony)
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Usage</em></span>: 
		Of course your disk head will not move randomly. If you have swap
		space in the middle of a disk between a constantly busy home
		partition and an almost unused archive partition, you would be
		better of if your swap were near the home partition for
		even shorter head movements. You would be even better off, if you
		had your swap on another otherwise unused disk, though.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Striping</em></span>: 
		Speed can be increased by writing to multiple swap areas
		simultaneously. Swap spaces with the same priority will be
		written to like a RAID. See <a class="xref" href="ar01s09.html#multiple_swap_areas" title="9.3. Multiple Swap Areas">Section 9.3, &#8220;Multiple Swap Areas&#8221;</a>.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Summary:</em></span> 
	Put your swap on a fast disk with many heads that is not busy doing
	other things. If you have multiple disks: Split swap and scatter it
	over all your disks or even different controllers.
