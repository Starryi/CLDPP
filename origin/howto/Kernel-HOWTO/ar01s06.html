        Applying a patch 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Incremental upgrades of the kernel are distributed as patches. For 
        example, if you have Linux v1.1.45, and you notice that there's a ` 
        <code class="literal">
          patch46.gz 
        </code>
        ' out there for it, it means you can upgrade to version 1.1.46 through 
        application of the patch. You might want to make a backup of the 
        source tree first (` 
        <code class="literal">
          make clean 
        </code>
        ' and then ` 
        <code class="literal">
          cd /usr/src; tar zcvf old-tree.tar.gz linux 
        </code>
        ' will make a compressed tar archive for you.). 
      </p><p>
        So, continuing with the example above, let's suppose that you have ` 
        <code class="literal">
          patch46.gz 
        </code>
        ' in 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src 
        </code>
        . 
        <code class="literal">
          cd 
        </code>
        to 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src 
        </code>
        and do a ` 
        <code class="literal">
          zcat patch46.gz [verbar] patch -p0 
        </code>
        ' (or ` 
        <code class="literal">
          patch -p0 [lt ] patch46 
        </code>
        ' if the patch isn't compressed). You'll see things whizz by (or 
        flutter by, if your system is that slow) telling you that it is trying 
        to apply hunks, and whether it succeeds or not. Usually, this action 
        goes by too quickly for you to read, and you're not too sure whether 
        it worked or not, so you might want to use the 
        <code class="literal">
          -s 
        </code>
        flag to 
        <code class="literal">
          patch 
        </code>
        , which tells 
        <code class="literal">
          patch 
        </code>
        to only report error messages (you don't get as much of the ``hey, my 
        computer is actually doing something for a change!'' feeling, but you 
        may prefer this..). To look for parts which might not have gone 
        smoothly, cd to 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </code>
        and look for files with a 
        <code class="literal">
          .rej 
        </code>
        extension. Some versions of 
        <code class="literal">
          patch 
        </code>
        (older versions which may have been compiled with on an inferior 
        filesystem) leave the rejects with a 
        <code class="literal">
          # 
        </code>
        extension. You can use ` 
        <code class="literal">
          find 
        </code>
        ' to look for you; find . -name '*.rej' -print prints all files who 
        live in the current directory or any subdirectories with a 
        <code class="literal">
          .rej 
        </code>
        extension to the standard output. 
      </p><p>
        If everything went right, do a ` 
        <code class="literal">
          make clean 
        </code>
        ', ` 
        <code class="literal">
          config 
        </code>
        ', and ` 
        <code class="literal">
          dep 
        </code>
        ' as described in sections 3 and 4. 
      </p><p>
        There are quite a few options to the 
        <code class="literal">
          patch 
        </code>
        command. As mentioned above, 
        <code class="literal">
          patch -s 
        </code>
        will suppress all messages except the errors. If you keep your kernel 
        source in some other place than 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </code>
        , 
        <code class="literal">
          patch -p1 
        </code>
        (in that directory) will patch things cleanly. Other 
        <code class="literal">
          patch 
        </code>
        options are well-documented in the manual page.

        If something goes wrong 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        (Note: this section refers mostly to quite old kernels) 
      </p><p>
        The most frequent problem that used to arise was when a patch modified 
        a file called ` 
        <code class="literal">
          config.in 
        </code>
        ' and it didn't look quite right, because you changed the options to 
        suit your machine. This has been taken care of, but one still might 
        encounter it with an older release. To fix it, look at the 
        <code class="literal">
          config.in.rej 
        </code>
        file, and see what remains of the original patch. The changes will 
        typically be marked with ` 
        <code class="literal">
          + 
        </code>
        ' and ` 
        <code class="literal">
          - 
        </code>
        ' at the beginning of the line. Look at the lines surrounding it, and 
        remember if they were set to ` 
        <code class="literal">
          y 
        </code>
        ' or ` 
        <code class="literal">
          n 
        </code>
        '. Now, edit 
        <code class="literal">
          config.in 
        </code>
        , and change ` 
        <code class="literal">
          y 
        </code>
        ' to ` 
        <code class="literal">
          n 
        </code>
        ' and ` 
        <code class="literal">
          n 
        </code>
        ' to ` 
        <code class="literal">
          y 
        </code>
        ' when appropriate. Do a patch -p0 &lt; config.in.rej and if it 
        reports that it succeeded (no fails), then you can continue on with a 
        configuration and compilation. The 
        <code class="literal">
          config.in.rej 
        </code>
        file will remain, but you can get delete it. 
      </p><p>
        If you encounter further problems, you might have installed a patch 
        out of order. If patch says ` 
        <code class="literal">
          previously applied patch detected: Assume -R? 
        </code>
        ', you are probably trying to apply a patch which is below your 
        current version number; if you answer ` 
        <code class="literal">
          y 
        </code>
        ', it will attempt to degrade your source, and will most likely fail; 
        thus, you will need to get a whole new source tree (which might not 
        have been such a bad idea in the first place). 
      </p><p>
        To back out (unapply) a patch, use ` 
        <code class="literal">
          patch -R 
        </code>
        ' on the original patch. 
      </p><p>
        The best thing to do when patches really turn out wrong is to start 
        over again with a clean, out-of-the-box source tree (for example, from 
        one of the 
        <code class="literal">
          linux-x.y.z.tar.gz 
        </code>
        files), and start again.

        Getting rid of the .orig files 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        After just a few patches, the 
        <code class="literal">
          .orig 
        </code>
        files will start to pile up. For example, one 1.1.51 tree I had was 
        once last cleaned out at 1.1.48. Removing the .orig files saved over a 
        half a meg. find . -name '*.orig' -exec rm -f {} ';' will take care of 
        it for you. Versions of 
        <code class="literal">
          patch 
        </code>
        which use 
        <code class="literal">
          # 
        </code>
        for rejects use a tilde instead of 
        <code class="literal">
          .orig 
        </code>
        . 
      </p><p>
        There are better ways to get rid of the 
        <code class="literal">
          .orig 
        </code>
        files, which depend on GNU 
        <code class="literal">
          xargs 
        </code>
        : find . -name '*.orig' | xargs rm or the ``quite secure but a little 
        more verbose'' method: find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | xargs --null rm 
        --

        Other patches 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        There are other patches (I'll call them ``nonstandard'') than the ones 
        Linus distributes. If you apply these, Linus' patches may not work 
        correctly and you'll have to either back them out, fix the source or 
        the patch, install a new source tree, or a combination of the above. 
        This can become very frustrating, so if you do not want to modify the 
        source (with the possibility of a very bad outcome), back out the 
        nonstandard patches before applying Linus', or just install a new 
        tree. Then, you can see if the nonstandard patches still work. If they 
        don't, you are either stuck with an old kernel, playing with the patch 
        or source to get it to work, or waiting (possibly begging) for a new 
        version of the patch to come out. 
      </p><p>
        How common are the patches not in the standard distribution? You will 
        probably hear of them. I used to use the noblink patch for my virtual 
        consoles because I hate blinking cursors (This patch is (or at least 
        was) frequently updated for new kernel releases.). With most newer 
        device drivers being developed as loadable modules, though, the 
        frequecy of ``nonstandard'' patches is decreasing significantly.
