      Kernel Files Information 
    </h2></div></div></div><p>
      This section gives a "very brief" and "introduction" to some of the 
      Linux Kernel System. If you have time you can give one reading. 
    </p><p>
      Caution: You should be extra careful about these Kernel Files and you 
      must not edit or touch or move/delete/rename them.

        vmlinuz and vmlinux 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        The "vm" stands for "Virtual Memory". Linux supports virtual memory 
        unlike old operating systems like DOS which have a hard limit of 640KB 
        memory. Linux can use the hard disk space as "virtual memory" and 
        hence the name "vm". The vmlinuz is the Linux kernel executable. This 
        is located at /boot/vmlinuz. This can be a soft link to something like 
        /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-19.8.0. The vmlinuz is created by "make zImage" 
        and you do "cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/linux/boot/zImage 
        /boot/vmlinuz". The vmlinuz is a compressed file of vmlinux. The 
        zImage is there for backward compatibility (smaller kernels). Note 
        that, in near future zImage may be dropped in favor of 'make bzImage' 
        (big zImage). The zImage (vmlinuz) is not just a compressed image, but 
        has gzip decompressor code built into it as well (at the beginning). 
        So you cannot use gunzip or gzip -dc to unpack vmlinuz. 
      </p><p>
        Both zImage and bzImage are compressed with gzip. The kernel includes 
        a mini-gunzip to uncompress the kernel and boot into it. The 
        difference is that the old zImage uncompresses the kernel into low 
        memory (the first 640k), and bzImage uncompresses the kernel into high 
        memory (over 1M). 
      </p><p>
        The vmlinux is the uncompressed built kernel, vmlinuz is the 
        compressed one, that has been made bootable. (Note both names vmlinux 
        and vmlinuz look same except for last letter z). Generally, you don't 
        need to worry about vmlinux, it is just an intermediate step. 
      </p><p>
        The kernel usually makes a bzImage, and stores it in arch/i386/boot, 
        and it is up to the user to copy it to /boot and configure GRUB or 
        LILO.

        bzImage 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        The bzImage is the compressed kernel image created with command 'make 
        bzImage' during kernel compile. It important to note that bzImage is 
        not compressed with 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
          bzip2 
        </em></span>
        !! The name bz in bzImage is misleading!! It stands for "Big Zimage". 
        The "b" in bzImage is "big". Both zImage and bzImage are compressed 
        with gzip. The kernel includes a mini-gunzip to uncompress the kernel 
        and boot into it. The difference is that the old zImage uncompresses 
        the kernel into low memory (the first 640k), and bzImage uncompresses 
        the kernel into high memory (over 1M). The only problem is that there 
        are a very few machines where bzImage is known to have problems 
        (because the machines are buggy). The bzImage actually boots faster, 
        but other than that, there's no difference in the way the system 
        *runs*. The rule is that if all drivers cannot fit into the zImage, 
        then you need to modularize more. 
      </p><p>
        If the kernel is small, it will work as both a zImage and a bzImage, 
        and the booted system runs the same way. A big kernel will work as a 
        bzImage, but not as a zImage. Both bootimages are gzipped, (bzImage is 
        not bzipped as the name would suggest), but are put together and 
        loaded differently, that allows the kernel to load in higher address 
        space, that does not limit it to lower memory in the pathetic intel 
        architecture. So why have both? Backward compatability. Some older 
        lilos and loadlins don't handle the bzImage format. Note, they *boot* 
        differently, but *run* the same. There is a lot of misinformation 
        given out about what a bzImage file is (mostly about it being 
        bzip2ed).

        The file 'module-info' is generated during the compile. It is an 
        information file that is at least used during filing proper kernel 
        OOPS reports. It is a list of the module entry points. It may also be 
        used by depmod in building the tables that are used by insmod and its

          There seems to be a dearth of information about the System.map file. 
          It's really nothing mysterious, and in the scheme of things, it's 
          really not that important. But a lack of documentation makes it 
          shady. It's like an earlobe; we all have one, but nobody really 
          knows why. This is a little web page I cooked up that explains the 
          why. 
        </p><p>
          Note, I'm not out to be 100[percnt] correct. For instance, it's 
          possible for a system to not have /proc filesystem support, but most 
          systems do. I'm going to assume you "go with the flow" and have a 
          fairly typical system. 
        </p><p>
          Some of the stuff on oopses comes from Alessandro Rubini's "Linux 
          Device Drivers" which is where I learned most of what I know about 
          kernel programming.

          What Are Symbols? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          In the context of programming, a symbol is the building block of a 
          program: it is a variable name or a function name. It should be of 
          no surprise that the kernel has symbols, just like the programs you 
          write. The difference is, of course, that the kernel is a very 
          complicated piece of coding and has many, many global symbols. 
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm667"></a>10.9.3. 
          What Is The Kernel Symbol Table? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          The kernel doesn't use symbol names. It's much happier knowing a 
          variable or function name by the variable or function's address. 
          Rather than using size_t BytesRead, the kernel prefers to refer to 
          this variable as (for example) c0343f20. 
        </p><p>
          Humans, on the other hand, do not appreciate names like c0343f20. We 
          prefer to use something like size_t BytesRead. Normally, this 
          doesn't present much of a problem. The kernel is mainly written in 
          C, so the compiler/linker allows us to use symbol names when we code 
          and allows the kernel to use addresses when it runs. Everyone is 
          happy. 
        </p><p>
          There are situations, however, where we need to know the address of 
          a symbol (or the symbol for an address). This is done by a symbol 
          table, and is very similar to how gdb can give you the function name 
          from a address (or an address from a function name). A symbol table 
          is a listing of all symbols along with their address. Here is an 
          example of a symbol table:

          What Is The System.map File? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          There are 2 files that are used as a symbol table: 
          </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
                /proc/ksyms 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                System.map 
              </p></li></ol></div><p>
        </p><p>
          There. You now know what the System.map file is. 
        </p><p>
          Every time you compile a new kernel, the addresses of various symbol 
          names are bound to change. 
        </p><p>
          /proc/ksyms is a "proc file" and is created on the fly when a kernel 
          boots up. Actually, it's not really a file; it's simply a 
          representation of kernel data which is given the illusion of being a 
          disk file. If you don't believe me, try finding the filesize of 
          /proc/ksyms. Therefore, it will always be correct for the kernel 
          that is currently running.. 
        </p><p>
          However, System.map is an actual file on your filesystem. When you 
          compile a new kernel, your old System.map has wrong symbol 
          information. A new System.map is generated with each kernel compile 
          and you need to replace the old copy with your new copy. 
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm687"></a>10.9.5. 
          What Is An Oops? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          What is the most common bug in your homebrewed programs? The 
          segfault. Good ol' signal 11. 
        </p><p>
          What is the most common bug in the Linux kernel? The segfault. 
          Except here, the notion of a segfault is much more complicated and 
          can be, as you can imagine, much more serious. When the kernel 
          dereferences an invalid pointer, it's not called a segfault -- it's 
          called an "oops". An oops indicates a kernel bug and should always 
          be reported and fixed. 
        </p><p>
          Note that an oops is not the same thing as a segfault. Your program 
          cannot recover from a segfault. The kernel doesn't necessarily have 
          to be in an unstable state when an oops occurs. The Linux kernel is 
          very robust; the oops may just kill the current process and leave 
          the rest of the kernel in a good, solid state. 
        </p><p>
          An oops is not a kernel panic. In a panic, the kernel cannot 
          continue; the system grinds to a halt and must be restarted. An oops 
          may cause a panic if a vital part of the system is destroyed. An 
          oops in a device driver, for example, will almost never cause a 
          panic. 
        </p><p>
          When an oops occurs, the system will print out information that is 
          relevent to debugging the problem, like the contents of all the CPU 
          registers, and the location of page descriptor tables. In 
          particular, the contents of the EIP (instruction pointer) is 
          printed. Like this: 
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
	   EIP: 0010:[&lt;00000000&gt;]
	   Call Trace: [&lt;c010b860&gt;]
          </pre><p>
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm695"></a>10.9.6. 
          What Does An Oops Have To Do With System.map? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          You can agree that the information given in EIP and Call Trace is 
          not very informative. But more importantly, it's really not 
          informative to a kernel developer either. Since a symbol doesn't 
          have a fixed address, c010b860 can point anywhere. 
        </p><p>
          To help us use this cryptic oops output, Linux uses a daemon called 
          klogd, the kernel logging daemon. klogd intercepts kernel oopses and 
          logs them with syslogd, changing some of the useless information 
          like c010b860 with information that humans can use. In other words, 
          klogd is a kernel message logger which can perform name-address 
          resolution. Once klogd tranforms the kernel message, it uses 
          whatever logger is in place to log system wide messages, usually 
          syslogd. 
        </p><p>
          To perform name-address resolution, klogd uses System.map. Now you 
          know what an oops has to do with System.map. 
        </p><p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>
            Fine print: 
          </em></span>
          There are actually two types of address resolution are performed by

          System.map and is therefore not relevant to this discussion, but 
          I'll describe it briefly anyhow.

            Klogd Dynamic Translation 
          </em></span>
        </p><p>
          Suppose you load a kernel module which generates an oops. An oops 
          message is generated, and klogd intercepts it. It is found that the 
          oops occured at d00cf810. Since this address belongs to a 
          dynamically loaded module, it has no entry in the System.map file. 
          klogd will search for it, find nothing, and conclude that a loadable 
          module must have generated the oops. klogd then queries the kernel 
          for symbols that were exported by loadable modules. Even if the 
          module author didn't export his symbols, at the very least, klogd 
          will know what module generated the oops, which is better than 
          knowing nothing about the oops at all. 
        </p><p>
          There's other software that uses System.map, and I'll get into that 
          shortly.

          Where Should System.map Be Located? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          System.map should be located wherever the software that uses it 
          looks for it. That being said, let me talk about where klogd looks 
          for it. Upon bootup, if klogd isn't given the location of System.map 
          as an argument, it will look for System.map in 3 places, in the 
          following order: 
          </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
                /boot/System.map 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                /System.map 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                /usr/src/linux/System.map 
              </p></li></ol></div><p>
        </p><p>
          System.map also has versioning information, and klogd intelligently 
          searches for the correct map file. For instance, suppose you're 
          running kernel 2.4.18 and the associated map file is 
          /boot/System.map. You now compile a new kernel 2.5.1 in the tree 
          /usr/src/linux. During the compiling process, the file 
          /usr/src/linux/System.map is created. When you boot your new kernel, 
          klogd will first look at /boot/System.map, determine it's not the 
          correct map file for the booting kernel, then look at 
          /usr/src/linux/System.map, determine that it is the correct map file 
          for the booting kernel and start reading the symbols. 
        </p><p>
          A few nota bene's: 
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                Somewhere during the 2.5.x series, the Linux kernel started to 
                untar into linux-version, rather than just linux (show of 
                hands -- how many people have been waiting for this to 
                happen?). I don't know if klogd has been modified to search in 
                /usr/src/linux-version/System.map yet. TODO: Look at the klogd 
                srouce. If someone beats me to it, please email me and let me 
                know if klogd has been modified to look in the new directory 
                name for the linux source code. 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                The man page doesn't tell the whole the story. Look at this:

          </p><pre class="programlisting">

          </pre><p>
        </p><p>
          Apparently, not only does klogd look for the correct version of the 
          map in the 3 klogd search directories, but klogd also knows to look 
          for the name "System.map" followed by "-kernelversion", like 
          System.map-2.4.18. This is undocumented feature of klogd. 
        </p><p>
          A few drivers will need System.map to resolve symbols (since they're 
          linked against the kernel headers instead of, say, glibc). They will 
          not work correctly without the System.map created for the particular 
          kernel you're currently running. This is NOT the same thing as a 
          module not loading because of a kernel version mismatch. That has to 
          do with the kernel version, not the kernel symbol table which 
          changes between kernels of the same version!

          Don't think that System.map is only useful for kernel oopses. 
          Although the kernel itself doesn't really use System.map, other

          What Happens If I Don't Have A Healthy System.map? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          Suppose you have multiple kernels on the same machine. You need a 
          separate System.map files for each kernel! If boot a kernel that 
          doesn't have a System.map file, you'll periodically see a message 
          like: System.map does not match actual kernel Not a fatal error, but 
          can be annoying to see everytime you do a ps ax. Some software, like 
          dosemu, may not work correctly (although I don't know of anything 
          off the top of my head). Lastly, your klogd or ksymoops output will 
          not be reliable in case of a kernel oops. See the manual pages by 
          giving commands 'man ksymoops' and 'man klogd'.

          How Do I Remedy The Above Situation? 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          The solution is to keep all your System.map files in /boot and 
          rename them with the kernel version. Suppose you have multiple 
          kernels like: 
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13 
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>
          Then just rename your map files according to the kernel version and 
          put them in /boot, like: 
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
	   /boot/System.map-2.2.14
	   /boot/System.map-2.2.13
          </pre><p>
        </p><p>
          Now what if you have two copies of the same kernel? Like: 
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14.nosound 
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>
          The best answer would be if all software looked for the following 
          files: 
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
	   /boot/System.map-2.2.14
	   /boot/System.map-2.2.14.nosound
          </pre><p>
        </p><p>
          You can also use symlinks: 
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
	   System.map-2.2.14
	   System.map-2.2.14.sound
	   ln -s System.map-2.2.14.sound System.map     # Here System.map -&gt; System.map-2.2.14.sound
          </pre><p>
