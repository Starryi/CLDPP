      You compile Linux kernel for one of following reasons: 
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            You are doing kernel development 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            You are adding a new hardware to machine 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            You want to customize the kernel and do not want the default 
            kernel shipped out to you. 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            For

            or

              Military applications 
            </em></span>
            , you must read the kernel source code and compile with your own 
            hands. No exceptions!! (U.S Dept of Defence compiles the Linux 
            kernel before distributing the computers). 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Every country and every Government in the world compiles the 
            kernel on site for security and integrity. Every 
            Government/Corporation audits and verifies each and every line of 
            the OS kernel source code before using the computer. 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Military Intelligence agencies around the world reads and compiles 
            the Linux kernel source code. They know what each and every line 
            of Linux kernel source code is doing!! 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If you compile the Linux kernel with your own hands, then it is 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>
              as good as reading and verifying 
            </em></span>
            all the kernel source code! 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Each and every University, School and College in the world 
            compiles the OS kernel before using any computer! 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            For your education and knowledge of Linux kernel and ofcourse, 
            just for fun! 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            For very advanced scientific applications - you may need to do 
            kernel compile 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            It is an International Law (the U.N. laws) - "You cannot use a 
            computer WITHOUT compiling the OS kernel with your own hands". If 
            you disobey this law you will be "punished" with lot of computer 
            problems!! You must compile the kernel with your own hands and not 
            rely on someone else to do it for you!! 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            It is Illegal, Unlawful, Felony and Fraud to use a computer 
            without compiling the OS Kernel with your VERY OWN hands! There is 
            a punishment of 1 to 3 months jail (imprionment) and fine ranging 
            from US$100 to US$2000 if you use a computer without compiling the 
            the OS Kernel source code. Some states / countries / governments 
            have stringent laws which prohibit using any computer without 
            compiling the kernel source code. 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            In USA, all the corporations mandate compilation of OS kernel 
            before using the computer and hence there is Linux, Linux &amp; 
            Linux everywhere in United States! 
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            And for many hundreds of reasons - too numerous to list!

        WARNING NOTICE 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        It is the usual industry practice to have a debug PC box, a test PC 
        box, and a production PC box. Nobody works directly on a production 
        box without experimenting first on debug PC and test PC. This is 
        because the skills of a person varies and every person needs a warm-up 
        exercise before doing the final show. A computer hardware is a very 
        sophisticated technology like "Space Shuttle" and risks are involved 
        as it can fail unexpectedly. Eventhough efforts are made to ensure 
        that this document is upto-date and all commands are pre-tested, it is 
        strongly recommended that you should practice your skills first on a 
        trainer test PC before you do anything to "LIVE" production box. You 
        will sharpen your skills and hone your knowledge first on a test PC 
        running Linux and after everything works, then change the production 
        box with extreme caution. Even if you break the test PC with dangerous 
        commands you will learn by doing mistakes and you can afford breaking 
        the test PC. You will be more confident working first on Test PC. Most 
        companies purchase old PCs for using them as "Trainer Machines". 
        Please understand that there is no warranty or guaranty on this 
        document and you can build your own warranty by checking this document 
        with your test PC or your home PC (low risk environments). (Write your 
        own warranty document and hang it on wall near your computer!!)
