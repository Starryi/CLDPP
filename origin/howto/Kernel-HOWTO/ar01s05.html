        What does the kernel do, anyway? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        The Unix kernel acts as a mediator for your programs and your 
        hardware. First, it does (or arranges for) the memory management for 
        all of the running programs (processes), and makes sure that they all 
        get a fair (or unfair, if you please) share of the processor's cycles. 
        In addition, it provides a nice, fairly portable interface for 
        programs to talk to your hardware. 
      </p><p>
        There is certainly more to the kernel's operation than this, but these 
        basic functions are the most important to know. 
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm334"></a>5.2. 
        Why would I want to upgrade my kernel? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Newer kernels generally offer the ability to talk to more types of 
        hardware (that is, they have more device drivers), they can have 
        better process management, they can run faster than the older 
        versions, they could be more stable than the older versions, and they 
        fix silly bugs in the older versions. Most people upgrade kernels 
        because they want the device drivers and the bug fixes. 
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm337"></a>5.3. 
        What kind of hardware do the newer kernels support? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        See the 
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO" target="_top">
          Hardware-HOWTO 
        </a>
        . Alternatively, you can look at the ` 
        <code class="literal">
          config.in 
        </code>
        ' file in the linux source, or just find out when you try ` 
        <code class="literal">
          make config 
        </code>
        '. This shows you all hardware supported by the standard kernel 
        distribution, but not everything that linux supports; many common 
        device drivers (such as the PCMCIA drivers and some tape drivers) are 
        loadable modules maintained and distributed separately.

        What version of gcc and libc do I need? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Linus recommends a version of gcc in the 
        <code class="literal">
          README 
        </code>
        file included with the linux source. If you don't have this version, 
        the documentation in the recommended version of gcc should tell you if 
        you need to upgrade your libc. This is not a difficult procedure, but 
        it is important to follow the instructions.

        What's a loadable module? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        See the Modules chapter at 
        <a class="xref" href="ar01s03.html" title="3.  Loadable Modules">Section 3, &#8220;
      Loadable Modules

        How much disk space do I need? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        It depends on your particular system configuration. First, the 
        compressed linux source is nearly 14 megabytes large at version 2.2.9. 
        Many sites keep this even after unpacking. Uncompressed and built with 
        a moderate configuration, it takes up another 67 MB. 
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm354"></a>5.7. 
        How long does it take? 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        With newer machines, the compilation takes dramatically less time than 
        older ones; an AMD K6-2/300 with a fast disk can do a 2.2.x kernel in 
        about four minutes. As for old Pentiums, 486s, and 386s, if you plan 
        to compile one, be prepared to wait, possibly hours, days.. 
      </p><p>
        If this troubles you, and you happen to have a faster machine around 
        to compile on, you can build on the fast machines (assuming you give 
        it the right parameters, that your ulilities are up-to-date, and so 
        on), and then transfer the kernel image to the slower machine.
