        Kernel Compiles OK but make modules fail 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Sympton: The kernel compiles ok producing bzImage but 'make modules' 
        fails. 
      </p><p>
        Solution: This problem is most tricky - there can be many subtle 
        reasons. May be related to Linux distro or dependencies of packages 
        are not uptodate. This one is very peculiar of Redhat distribution but 
        may happen to other distributions. There are some "left over" files 
        which are hanging and causing problems. The remedy is to do 'make 
        mrproper' and 'make clean' and then do 'make modules'. But you may 
        want to copy the saved config file as shown below: 
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
bash# cd /usr/src/linux 
bash# mkdir /usr/src/kernelconfigs ;
bash# cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/kernelconfigs/.config.save;
bash# cp /usr/src/linux/.config  /usr/src/linux/configs/.config.save  # ExtraSafe
bash# cp /boot/config*  /usr/src/linux/configs/  # ExtraSafe
bash# make clean
bash# make mrproper  # "MUST DO THIS mrproper", otherwise you will face hell lot of problems !!
bash# make clean
bash# cp /usr/src/kernelconfigs/.config.save .config  # In case you want to reuse the config file ??

          Wrong Config File Copied 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          If the 'make mrproper' in above section does not fix this problem, 
          then you are trapped by some other subtle problems. May be something 
          is seriously wrong with config file. You might have started with a 
          wrong CPU config file - you might have chosen ATHLON CPU type for 
          your Pentium machine or Cyrix CPU for your Athlon machine. Start all 
          over again, if you have Athlon CPU then copy the athlon.config or if 
          you have Intel 686 CPU then copy the i686.config file. Copy from the 
          default vanilla config file from /usr/src/linux/configs 
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
	bash# cp /usr/src/linux/configs/kernel-2.4.18-i686.config  /usr/src/linux/.config
	Or for athlon processors

          Packages Not In Sync 
        </h4></div></div></div><p>
          Still having problems? If above section does not fix the problems, 
          then you are trapped by some other subtle problems. Are you sure you 
          have all the dependencies of packages taken care of ?? Are all the 
          dependent packages in sync with each other? Did you install any 
          package with "--nodeps" option? You should automate the dependencies 
          with powerful tool like apt-get ( See the section "Install, Update 
          at Speed of Light" in 
          <a class="xref" href="ar01s12.html" title="12.  Install, Upgrade at Speed of Light With apt-get (Redhat, Debian, Suse, Mandrake, Others)">Section 12, &#8220;

      Mandrake, Others) 
    &#8221;</a>
          ). Manually trying to sync up hundreds of libraries and packages is 
          a heck of a work, use apt-get . Refer to the section "Install, 
          Update at Speed of Light" in 
          <a class="xref" href="ar01s12.html" title="12.  Install, Upgrade at Speed of Light With apt-get (Redhat, Debian, Suse, Mandrake, Others)">Section 12, &#8220;

        Compiles OK but does not boot 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Sympton: If the kernel compiles ok but booting never works and it 
        always complains with a kernel panic about /sbin/modprobe. 
      </p><p>
        Solution: You did not create initrd image file. See the Appendix A at 
        <a class="xref" href="ar01s15.html" title="15.  Appendix A - Creating initrd.img file">Section 15, &#8220;
      Appendix A - Creating initrd.img file 
    &#8221;</a>
        . 
      </p><p>
        Also, you must do 'make modules' and 'make modules_install' in 
        addition to creating the initrd image file. Even if you had run 'make 
        modules' before, try running again for the second time (does not 
        hurt). Give 'make modules' and 'make modules_install' once again to 
        make sure for certain that all the loadable modules are put in place.

        The System Hangs at LILO 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
          Sympton: 
        </em></span>
        After you build the kernel and reboot, the system hangs just before 
        LILO. 
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
          Reason: 
        </em></span>
        Probably you did not set the BIOS to pick up the proper Primary Master 
        IDE and Secondary Slave IDE hard disk partition. 
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
          Solution: 
        </em></span>
        Power on the machine and press DEL key to do setup of the BIOS (Basic 
        Input Output system). Select the IDE settings and set proper primary 
        hard disk partition and slave drives. When the system boots it looks 
        for the primary IDE hard disk and the Master Boot Record partition. It 
        reads the MBR and starts loading the Linux Kernel from the hard disk 
        partition. 
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1310"></a>19.4. 
        No init found 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        The following mistake is commited very frequently by new users. 
      </p><p>
        If your new kernel does not boot and you get - 
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
	Warning: unable to open an initial console
	Kernel panic: no init found. Try passing init= option to kernel
        </pre><p>
        The problem is that you 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
          did not 
        </em></span>
        set the "root=" parameter properly in the /etc/lilo.conf. In my case, 
        I used root=/dev/hda1 which is having the root partition "/". You must 
        properly point the root device in your lilo.conf, it can be like 
        /dev/hdb2 or /dev/hda7. 
      </p><p>
        There may be errors just before this Kernel panic. Look for and read 
        any error messages just above the like 'Kernel panic:'. The failure 
        may be due to any error messages just before this one (it is 
        cummulative effect). For example, before the 'Kernel panic' error you 
        might have got error like 'kernel-module version mismatch' or 
        'something-else-some-other-error-message'. Try to correct the FIRST 
        error reported by the system. 
      </p><p>
        The kernel looks for the init command which is located in /sbin/init. 
        And /sbin directory lives on the root partition. For details see - 
        </p><pre class="programlisting">

        The 'make', 'make bzImage', 'make modules' or 'make modules_install'

        make.

        If this problem persists, then try menuconfig instead of xconfig. 
        Sometimes GUI version xconfig causes some problems:

        <span class="emphasis"><em>

        Kernel fails to load a module 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        If the kernel fails to load a module (say loadable module for network 
        card or other devices), then you may want to try to build the driver 
        for device right into the kernel. Sometimes 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>
            loadable module will NOT work 
          </em></span>
        </em></span>
        and the driver needs to be built right inside the kernel. For example 
        - some network cards do not support loadable module feature - you MUST 
        build the driver of the network card right into linux kernel. Hence, 
        in 'make xconfig' you MUST not select loadable module for this device.

        If your new kernel does really weird things after a routine kernel 
        upgrade, chances are you forgot to 
        <code class="literal">
          make clean 
        </code>
        before compiling the new kernel. Symptoms can be anything from your

        Make sure you do a

        Huge or slow kernels 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        If your kernel is sucking up a lot of memory, is too large, and/or 
        just takes forever to compile even when you've got your new 
        Quadbazillium-III/4400 working on it, you've probably got lot of 
        unneeded stuff (device drivers, filesystems, etc) configured. If you 
        don't use it, don't configure it, because it does take up memory. The 
        most obvious symptom of kernel bloat is extreme swapping in and out of 
        memory to disk; if your disk is making a lot of noise and it's not one 
        of those old Fujitsu Eagles that sound like a jet landing when 
        turned off, look over your kernel configuration. 
      </p><p>
        You can find out how much memory the kernel is using by taking the 
        total amount of memory in your machine and subtracting from it the 
        amount of ``total mem'' in 
        <code class="literal">
          /proc/meminfo

        or the output of the command `

        under `Character devices', select `Parallel printer support'. 
      </p><p>
        Then there are the names. Linux 2.2 names the printer devices 
        differently than previous releases. The upshot of this is that if you 
        had an 
        <code class="literal">
          lp1 
        </code>
        under your old kernel, it's probably an 
        <code class="literal">
          lp0 
        </code>
        under your new one. Use ` 
        <code class="literal">
          dmesg 
        </code>
        ' or look through the logs in 
        <code class="literal">

        Kernel doesn't compile 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        If it does not compile, then it is likely that a patch failed, or your 
        source is somehow corrupt. Your version of gcc also might not be 
        correct, or could also be corrupt (for example, the include files 
        might be in error). Make sure that the symbolic links which Linus 
        describes in the 
        <code class="literal">
          README 
        </code>
        are set up correctly. In general, if a standard kernel does not 
        compile, something is seriously wrong with the system, and 
        reinstallation of certain tools is probably necessary. 
      </p><p>
        In some cases, gcc can crash due to hardware problems. The error 
        message will be something like ``xxx exited with signal 15'' and it 
        will generally look very mysterious. I probably would not mention 
        this, except that it happened to me once - I had some bad cache 
        memory, and the compiler would occasionally barf at random. Try 
        reinstalling gcc first if you experience problems. You should only get 
        suspicious if your kernel compiles fine with external cache turned 
        off, a reduced amount of RAM, etc. 
      </p><p>
        It tends to disturb people when it's suggested that their hardware has 
        problems. Well, I'm not making this up. There is an FAQ for it -- it's

        New version of the kernel doesn't seem to boot

        You did not run LILO, or it is not configured correctly. One thing 
        that ``got'' me once was a problem in the config file; it said ` 
        <code class="literal">
          boot = /dev/hda1

        ' instead of ` 
        <code class="literal">
          boot = /dev/hda 
        </code>
        ' (This can be really annoying at first, but once you have a working

        You forgot to run LILO, or system doesn't boot at all 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Ooops! The best thing you can do here is to boot off of a floppy disk 
        or CDROM and prepare another bootable floppy (such as ` 
        <code class="literal">
          make zdisk 
        </code>
        ' would do). You need to know where your root ( 
        <code class="literal">
          / 
        </code>
        ) filesystem is and what type it is (e.g. second extended, minix). In 
        the example below, you also need to know what filesystem your 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </code>
        source tree is on, its type, and where it is normally mounted. 
      </p><p>
        In the following example, 
        <code class="literal">
          / 
        </code>
        is 
        <code class="literal">
          /dev/hda1 
        </code>
        , and the filesystem which holds 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src/linux 
        </code>
        is 
        <code class="literal">
          /dev/hda3 
        </code>
        , normally mounted at 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr 
        </code>
        . Both are second extended filesystems. The working kernel image in 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot 
        </code>
        is called 
        <code class="literal">
          bzImage 
        </code>
        . 
      </p><p>
        The idea is that if there is a functioning 
        <code class="literal">
          bzImage 
        </code>
        , it is possible to use that for the new floppy. Another alternative, 
        which may or may not work better (it depends on the particular method 
        in which you messed up your system) is discussed after the example. 
      </p><p>
        First, boot from a boot/root disk combo or rescue disk, and mount the 
        filesystem which contains the working kernel image: 
      </p><p>
        mkdir /mnt mount -t ext2 /dev/hda3 /mnt 
      </p><p>
        If 
        <code class="literal">
          mkdir 
        </code>
        tells you that the directory already exists, just ignore it. Now, 
        <code class="literal">
          cd 
        </code>
        to the place where the working kernel image was. Note that /mnt + 
        /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot - /usr = /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot 
        Place a formatted disk in drive ``A:'' (not your boot or root disk!), 
        dump the image to the disk, and configure it for your root filesystem: 
      </p><p>
        cd /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0 rdev 
        /dev/fd0 /dev/hda1 
      </p><p>
        <code class="literal">
          cd 
        </code>
        to 
        <code class="literal">
          / 
        </code>
        and unmount the normal 
        <code class="literal">
          /usr 
        </code>
        filesystem: 
      </p><p>
        cd / umount /mnt 
      </p><p>
        You should now be able to reboot your system as normal from this 
        floppy. Don't forget to run lilo (or whatever it was that you did 
        wrong) after the reboot! 
      </p><p>
        As mentioned above, there is another common alternative. If you 
        happened to have a working kernel image in 
        <code class="literal">
          / 
        </code>
        ( 
        <code class="literal">
          /vmlinuz 
        </code>
        for example), you can use that for a boot disk. Supposing all of the 
        above conditions, and that my kernel image is 
        <code class="literal">
          /vmlinuz 
        </code>
        , just make these alterations to the example above: change 
        <code class="literal">
          /dev/hda3 
        </code>
        to 
        <code class="literal">
          /dev/hda1 
        </code>
        (the 
        <code class="literal">
          / 
        </code>
        filesystem), 
        <code class="literal">
          /mnt/src/linux 
        </code>
        to 
        <code class="literal">
          /mnt 
        </code>
        , and 
        <code class="literal">
          if=bzImage 
        </code>
        to 
        <code class="literal">
          if=vmlinuz 
        </code>
        . The note explaining how to derive 
        <code class="literal">
          /mnt/src/linux 
        </code>
        may be ignored. 
      </p><p>
        Using LILO with big drives (more than 1024 cylinders) can cause 
        problems. See the LILO mini-HOWTO or documentation for help on that.

        This can be a severe problem. Starting with a kernel release after 
        Linux v1.0 (around 20 Apr 1994), a program called ` 
        <code class="literal">

        </code>
        ' which periodically flushes out the filesystem buffers, was

        it (you probably want to run your system under the old kernel while 
        doing this). It installs itself as ` 
        <code class="literal">
          update 
        </code>
        ' and after a reboot, the new kernel should no longer complain.

        I can't get my IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive to work 
      </h3></div></div></div><p>
        Strangely enough, lot of people cannot get their ATAPI drives working, 
        probably because there are a number of things that can go wrong. 
      </p><p>
        If your CD-ROM drive is the only device on a particular IDE interface, 
        it must be jumpered as ``master'' or ``single.'' Supposedly, this is 
        the most common error. 
      </p><p>
        Creative Labs (for one) has put IDE interfaces on their sound cards 
        now. However, this leads to the interesting problem that while some 
        people only have one interface to being with, many have two IDE 
        interfaces built-in to their motherboards (at IRQ15, usually), so a 
        common practice is to make the soundblaster interface a third IDE port 
        (IRQ11, or so I'm told). 
      </p><p>
        This causes problems with older Linux versions like 1.3 and below. in 
        that versions Linux don't support a third IDE interface. To get around 
        this, you have a few choices. 
      </p><p>
        If you have a second IDE port already, chances are that you are not 
        using it or it doesn't already have two devices on it. Take the ATAPI 
        drive off the sound card and put it on the second interface. You can 
        then disable the sound card's interface, which saves an IRQ anyway. 
      </p><p>
        If you don't have a second interface, jumper the sound card's 
        interface (not the sound card's sound part) as IRQ15, the second 
        interface. It should work.

        The linux kernel source includes a number of include files (the things

        <code class="literal">

        ) which are referenced by the standard ones in 
        <code class="literal">

        . They are typically referenced like this (where 
        <code class="literal">
          xyzzy.h

          /usr/include/linux 
        </code>
        ): #include &lt;linux/xyzzy.h&gt; Normally, there is a link called

        in 
        <code class="literal">

        <code class="literal">

        </code>
        in the typical system). If this link is not there, or points to the 
        wrong place, most things will not compile at all. If you decided that 
        the kernel source was taking too much room on the disk and deleted it, 
        this will obviously be a problem. Another way it might go wrong is 
        with file permissions; if your 
        <code class="literal">
          root 
        </code>
        has a umask which doesn't allow other users to see its files by
