<P>Redhat RPM program is the key program to install Redhat Linux Source RPMs.
There are more than 8000 Redhat application programs available 
on the internet in rpm source-code format. If you just install 
<B>rpm</B> program
on other flavors of Unix like Solaris, AIX, Irix or HPUX, then you can
very easily compile, build and install any of those 8000 application source
RPMs. </P>
<P>RPM is the "gateway" to thousands of applications and programs, which are in 
source code rpm format.</P>
<P>Maintainence of application programs is extremely easy with RPM program.
You can very easily remove, add and upgrade the application package from the
system. Using RPM program you can query the system to find the list of
packages installed and you can even list the files installed by a particular
package. RPM program can also give the exact path locations of the files
installed by a particular package. </P>
<P>The upgrades and updates can be automated using the 
<B>rpm</B> program
and the Redhat Network support.</P>
<P><I>The redhat <B>rpm</B> program is extremely powerful, extremely easy to use and is the
most popular packaging program in the world. Packaging programs on other Unix platforms like 
pkgadd, smitt are very primitive and are not as powerful as <B>rpm</B> program. And
<B>rpm</B> program is very portable and works on most Unix operating systems.</I></P>
<P>The guidelines given here can be useful for setting up
Debian package program
<B>deb</B> on Solaris and other Unix flavors.
GNU Debian Linux is another popular distribution and uses <B>deb</B> program
which is similar to 
<B>rpm</B> program
. You can use either 
<B>rpm</B> or
<B>deb</B> program.</P>
