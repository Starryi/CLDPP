<P>Sometimes, buying a diskless linux computer will be cheaper than building!!
In modern days we focus our energy on economy and managing the time efficiently.
Gone are the days when you would build everything on your own! Man introduced the 
concept of mass production (factory having production lines churning out millions 
of pieces). In the industrialized nation like U.S.A, every product you see is made 
in mass-production and diskless computers are no exception. There are many 
companies in USA which manufacture diskless computers in very large quantities.</P>
<P>Checkout the following commercial sites, which are selling diskless 
linux network-cards and diskless computers. These companies do <B>mass
production</B> of Linux Diskless computers selling millions of units and thereby 
reducing the cost per unit. Each and every fortune 1000 companies in USA will be
replacing the MS Windows PCs with diskless computers in near future as diskless
linux computers can run both Linux and MS Windows 95 programs (via 
VMWare BIOS software). 
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</A> is NOT a 
emulator but has BIOS which allows you to install Windows 98/NT as 
guest OS to linux. You can use the 'xhost' command and DISPLAY environment from
diskless node to run Windows95/Linux programs. See 'man xhost' on linux.
You can also use Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to run Windows95/NT programs on
linux diskless nodes. Get VNC from

Or you can use 
<A HREF="http://www.thincomputinginc.com">WinConnect</A> to access
MS Windows applications like MS Office, Outlook etc. But WinConnect needs MS Windows XP/2000/NT
server.</P>
