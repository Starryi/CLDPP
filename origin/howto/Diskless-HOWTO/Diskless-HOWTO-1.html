<P>Diskless Linux Computers do not have any hard-disk, floppy drives and tape drives. They offer
significant savings in "Total Cost of Ownership" by eliminating the maintenance costs.
You can accomplish Diskless Linux Computer by one of the following two methods:
<OL>
<LI> Boot directly a Live Linux CDROM. The Linux CDROM is live Linux system which
contains all the applications and programs and loads the software into RAM disks.

</LI>
<LI> Recent linux kernels offer the possibility to boot a linux box entirely from network, by
loading its kernel and root filesystem from a server. In that case, the client may use
several ways to get the first instructions it has to execute when booting: home made
eproms, special network cards implementing the RARP, BOOTP or DHCP protocols, cdroms, or
bootloaders loaded from a boot floppy or a local hard drive.</LI>
</OL>

The simplest and most easy method to build a diskless linux is by using Live Linux CDROM. 
You simply download Live Linux CDROM and insert it into the CDROM drive and power-on and you are
done! For details see the "Live Linux CDROM" chapter in this document.</P>
<P>The other option is using a EPROM, but this will
take extra work to be done on the client and the server box. 
If you want to go for EPROM method, I recommend you to
simply buy Diskless Linux computers from the manufacturers as given in the following chapters.</P>
