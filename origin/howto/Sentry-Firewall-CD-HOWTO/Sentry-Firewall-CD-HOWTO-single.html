<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P> This is the long-overdue Sentry Firewall CDROM howto.  I hope this
document helps get you started using the Sentry Firewall CD and answers
any questions you might have regarding how the system works.  The most
current version of this howto can be obtained at the following URL:

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is the Sentry Firewall CD?</A>
</H2>

<P> The Sentry Firewall CD is a Linux-based bootable CDROM suitable
for use in a variety of different operating environments.  The system is
designed to be configured dynamically via a floppy disk or over a network.
This allows one to configure the system dynamically, eventho much of the actual
system is on read-only(CDROM) media.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Why would I use a CD-based firewall or server?</A>
</H2>

<P> There are several advantages of using a CDROM based system in various
security related environments.  The main system is centered around the ramdisk;
a compressed file system image which is loaded into RAM at boot time.  Any
changes to the ramdisk image are temporary, and will be undone upon the next
reboot. Furthermore, the ramdisk, kernel, binaries, etc,  related to the
operating system are kept on read-only media(CDROM).  This means that if the
security of a box running a CDROM based system is ever compromised the attacker
can at best own the box until the next reboot.  So there is no real threat of
having to go through the tedious task of rebuilding and hardening the system
after a successful attack is discovered.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 I'm a Linux newbie, will the Sentry Firewall CD be a good choice for me?</A>
</H2>

<P> At the moment, there are at least a couple variations of the Sentry Firewall CD
that are based on various Linux distributions.  You should first choose the Linux
distribution you are most familiar with.  More information on the different types can
be found on the web site - http://www.SentryFirewall.com/.</P>

<P> Basically, the Sentry Firewall CD is meant to be configured just like a normal
Slackware or Redhat or whatever Linux system. There are no GUIs, no scripts to do it
for you.  The idea behind the configuration of the CD is that you are able to
reconfigure the system by replacing the startup scripts and the various configuration
files normally present on the system at boot time.  Most of these are simply text
files and shell scripts that you need to edit by hand in order configure properly.
There are, however, usually plenty of resources available to assist you in
configuring a specific service or daemon(HOWTOs on linux.org, for example).</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What's with all these branches(SENTRYCD/SENTRYCD-RH/SENTRYCD-xxx)?  What's the difference between the branches?</A>
</H2>

<P> First, let me explain briefly how the Sentry Firewall CD works.  Basically, there is the
"host" system, a Linux system that is based on one of several Linux distributions.  Then there
are the configuration scripts, written in perl, that run after the kernel boots and help
configure the system on the fly.  In general, it is possible to create a Sentry Firewall CD
system based on nearly any Linux distribution while only modifying one of the five perl scripts.</P>

<P> So, to answer your question, each Sentry Firewall CD branch utilizes similar configuration
methods, but are simply based on different Linux distributions.  Since I'm a Slackware fan, I used
that distribution as the foundation for the original Sentry Firewall CD(the "SENTRYCD" branch).
It has always been my desire to utilize other Linux distributions for this project, which is why
I created the "SENTRYCD-RH" branche.  There will no doubt eventually be other branches and
variations.</P>

<P><B>Sentry Firewall CD Development Branches:</B>
<UL>
<LI> <B>SENTRYCD</B> - Slackware-like Sentry Firewall CD.</LI>
<LI> <B>SENTRYCD-DEB</B> - Debian-like Sentry Firewall CD. (In Development)</LI>
<LI> <B>SENTRYCD-RH</B> - RedHat-like Sentry Firewall CD. (Deprecated)</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P> In any case, all the basic functionality is present in each branch.  But since different
Linux distributions are configured differently, using different rc files or files in /etc/sysconfig
for example, some of the configuration directives(explained below) will vary between the two branches.</P>

<P> The current copyright and disclaimer can be found on the website;

Firewall CD, and all the scripts and documentation associated with it.</P>


<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="s2">2. How the CD Works (Overview)</A></H2>

<P> This section is just an overview to explain how the Sentry Firewall CD works,
that is, from the process of loading the kernel to running the Sentry Firewall
CD configuration scripts located on the RAMDisk.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The Boot Process</A>
</H2>

<P> Booting from the CDROM is a fairly familiar process. The BIOS execs the
bootloader(Syslinux) - which then displays a bootprompt and loads the kernel and
ramdisk into memory.  Once the kernel is running, the ramdisk is then mounted as
root(/).</P>
<P>An obvious necessity for deploying CDROM based systems is the ability to
dynamically configure the system for various environments with different
configurations, which is what a good majority of this project is dedicated to
building.  A simple way to do this is to give the user the ability to customize
the startup scripts located in /etc/rc.d before they are actually used, as well
as the ability to customize other important system configuration files.</P>
<P>At boot time, the /etc and /etc/rc.d directories are nearly empty.  On a
Slackware system the first rc file to run is /etc/rc.d/rc.S - and it is from
this file where we run the configuration scripts that look for a configuration
file(sentry.conf), and place the proper configuration and system files in /etc
and various subdirectories under /etc.  On other Linux systems, such as RedHat,
the configuration scripts would be run from rc.sysinit.  If there is not a
configuration directive for a specific file, or if a configuration file cannot be
found, then the default system files are used - which are located in /etc/default/*
on the ramdisk.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 ISOLINUX</A>
</H2>

<P> Early versions of the Sentry Firewall CD utilized the 2.88MB floppy
emulation method, along with either lilo or syslinux to boot the kernel and load
the ramdisk.  This method proved very limiting for two reasons; A) the total
size of the compressed ramdisk AND kernel was limited to 2.88MB, and B) it was
quite slow compared to the current method.</P>
<P>The Sentry Firewall CD is currently utilizing the isolinux.bin boot record
with no emulation in order to properly boot the CDs.  This allows us to use a
much larger ramdisk and offer a choice of several kernels to boot at boot time.</P>
<P>More information about syslinux can be found at 
<A HREF="http://syslinux.zytor.com/">syslinux.zytor.com</A>.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 The CD Configuration Scripts</A>
</H2>

<P> As previously mentioned, our configuration scripts which reside in
/etc/rc.d/SENTRY/ on the ramdisk are generally run from an rc script in /etc/rc.d/.
The first script to run is called 'cd-config.pl', which is essentially the mainline
for the entire program.  The other scripts that are used are called 'get_config.pl',
'process_conf.pl', 'do_config.pl' and 'networking.pl'.  These scripts were written
specifically for this project, and are essentially the mainstay of the entire
configuration process.</P>
<P>In depth review of these scripts is a little beyond the scope of this
document, but is covered a bit in the file called 'DOCUMENTATION' available on
the website (
<A HREF="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">http://www.SentryFirewall.com/</A>).  The files are written
in perl, and do several important things; read in and parse the configuration
file(sentry.conf), locate and retrieve the important files detailed in the
sentry.conf file, and replace the system default files with the ones the user
has defined in the configuration file.</P>


<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Obtaining the CDROM</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Downloading</A>
</H2>

<P> The CDROM is distributed as a gzip or bzip2 compressed iso image, and is
generally between 95-105MB in size.  ISO images for the sentyrcd-RH branch are
generally much larger, between 150-200MB in size.  Available download mirrors
are listed on the websites; 
<A HREF="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">http://www.SentryFirewall.com/</A> or
<A HREF="http://Sentry.Sourceforge.net/">http://Sentry.Sourceforge.net/</A>.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Purchasing</A>
</H2>

<P> Although the iso image is free to use and distribute, copies of the Sentry
Firewall CD mailed to you at a minimal cost.  Custom versions of the CD and support
can also be made available and tailored to a specific network configuration.</P>
<P>For more information about these services, please
<A HREF="mailto:Obsid@Sentry.net">email me</A>.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Burning the CDROM</A>
</H2>

<P> This section will attempt a general overview on how to burn the CD iso
image once you have obtained it from one of the mirrors.  All the commands
presume you're working in Linux.  Buring ISO images in Windows is not covered
in this howto.  If you are using windows then check out the
<A HREF="http://www.e-smith.org/docs/howto/CD_burning_howto.php3">CD Burning Howto</A></P>
<P>First, let's decompress the iso image: <BR>
<B>NOTE:</B> Make sure you have enough disk space, the decompressed iso image can be
somewhere between 250MB and 400MB.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ gzip -d sentrycd.iso.gz

or

blah@wherever:~$ bzip2 -d sentrycd.iso.bz2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Verify the integrity of the iso image,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ md5sum -b sentrycd.iso
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> Now, let's try to burn the CD.  You'll need the 'cdrecord' utility
available, it can be obtained 
<A HREF="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html">here</A>.
You will want to run 'cdrecord -scanbus' in order to find the 'dev' value
required for the following command.  You will also need to know the write speed
of your CDRW.  Details on how to set this all up are beyond the scope of this
document, please refer to the 
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html">CD Writing HOWTO</A>
for more details.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ DEV="DEV_LINE_HERE" SPEED="SPEED"
blah@wherever:~$ cdrecord -v -data speed=$SPEED dev=$DEV sentrycd.iso
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>That's it, you now have a Sentry Firewall CDROM.  By the way, you
may have to be 'root' to do all this.</P>
<P>Keep in mind, if you simply want to look at the ISO image without actually
burning the CD, you can mount the image on a loopback device;</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ mount -o loop ./sentrycd.iso /MOUNT_POINT
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Where &#34;MOUNT_POINT&#34; is where you would like the CD mounted.  You may
then 'cd' to the MOUNT_POINT directory and poke around - don't forget to 'umount' the
image once you're finished.  This assumes you have support in your kernel for
the loopback device.  You probably do, but once again, recompiling kernels is
beyond the scope of this document.</P>


<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Using the Sentry Firewall CDROM</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> The configuration scripts which are run from /etc/rc.d/rc.S first look for
a configuration file called 'sentry.conf' on a floppy disk which, if present,
will be mounted on /floppy.  In order to configure the Linux system for use
in any particular environment the user must have the ability to replace the
system default files with his/her own copies.  The 'sentry.conf' file basically
tells the configuration scripts which files it should replace and where those
files are.</P>
<P>A good example of a sentry.conf file can be found on the Sentry Firewall CD
in the directory /SENTRY/scripts/cd-config/.  Configuration floppy disk
images(1.44M) can also be found in /SENTRY/images/ on the CD.  These files are also
available on the website, 
<A HREF="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">http://www.SentryFirewall.com/</A></P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The sentry.conf file</A>
</H2>

<P> The main configuration file for the system is called 'sentry.conf'.  It will
first be looked for on a floppy disk(/dev/fd0).  The file accepts several
configuration directives, many of which will be discussed below.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3>Example</H3>

<P>A basic configuration file looks like the following (everything after a '#'
sign is interpreted as a comment):</P>
<P>
<PRE>
----snip----
## Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file(sentry.conf)

rc.local = /floppy/config1/rc.local
fstab = /floppy/config1/fstab

passwd = /floppy/config1/passwd
shadow = /floppy/config1/shadow

# EOF #
----snip----
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The syntax is pretty simple, the default 'rc.local' file will be replaced with
the user defined 'rc.local' file located in the '/floppy/config1/' directory.  Same
goes for 'fstab', 'passwd', and the 'shadow' file.   But it is important to
remember, the first place the sentry.conf file will be looked for is on
/dev/fd0, which if found, will be mounted on /floppy.  This is why all these
files appear to be located in the /floppy directory, it is simply the mount
point for the floppy disk.</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> As of version 1.3.0, a user may now omit the `/floppy'
prefix.  So, for example a line in sentry.conf that says the following:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   shadow = config1/shadow
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Will be assumed to mean(in most cases) the following:
<PRE>
   fstab = /floppy/config1/shadow
</PRE>

As long as /floppy/config1/shadow exists.</P>

<P><BR>Unfortunately, you cannot arbitrarily replace files, for example the
following will likely not be parsed correctly:
<PRE>
     foo.conf = /floppy/config1/foo.conf
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The configuration scripts only recognize a certain number of configuration
files, so it probably won't know what to do with "foo.conf".  There are other
very easy ways to copy configuration files into their proper location, however.
These methods will be discussed below.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Network Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P> As of version 1.0.5, a new syntax for the configuration directives are
recognized; those with an "http://" or "ftp://" prefix.  This basically means
that the following syntax is now supported:
<PRE>
     inetd.conf = ftp://[user:pass@]123.123.123.123/config1/inetd.conf
     hosts = http://[user:pass@]123.123.123.123/config1/hosts
</PRE>
</P>
<P>As of version 1.3.0, "https://", "scp://", and "sftp://" URLs are also supported.
For example:
<PRE>
     shadow = scp://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@123.123.123.123/dir/shadow
     passwd = sftp://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@123.123.123.123/dir/passwd
     fstab = https://[user:pass@]123.123.123.123/dir/fstab
</PRE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> The username and password fields are required when retrieving files
via scp or sftp.  Empty passwords are not permitted.</P>

<P><BR>In order to accomplish this the configuration scripts need to have the
ability to set up an ethernet interface, as well as obtain nameserver
information from the sentry.conf file.  The syntax to accomplish this is the
following:
<PRE>
     device{1..10} = &lt;device&gt;:&lt;driver&gt;:&lt;IP address&gt;[|Gateway_IP]

     or..

     device{1..10} = &lt;device&gt;:&lt;driver&gt;:dhcp[|Hostname]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>And to set up a nameserver:
<PRE>
     nameserver = &lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;
</PRE>
</P>

<P><BR>Additionally, when retrieving files using "http", "https", or "ftp",
you may also set up a proxy server.  The following directives will allow you
to do so (they may not all be required for your setup):
<PRE>
     http_proxy = http://&lt;hostname&gt;/
     ftp_proxy = http://&lt;hostname&gt;/
     proxy-user = &lt;PROXY_USER&gt;
     proxy-passwd = &lt;PROXY_PASSWORD&gt;
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Passive FTP may also be required.  If so, use the 'passive-ftp' option, ie:
<PRE>
     passive-ftp = &lt;on|off>  ## Default == off
</PRE>
</P>

<P><BR>So, for example to set up an interface called "eth0", which uses the "tulip"
driver and can obtain its ip address from a DHCP server, we can use the
following line:
<PRE>
     device1 = eth0:tulip:dhcp
</PRE>
</P>

<P> As you can see, a total of 10 devices are allowed.  Let's say we now want to
set up an interface "eth1" that uses an "rtl8139" chip, and has a static
IP(192.168.1.2) and a default gateway(192.168.1.1):
<PRE>
     device2 = eth1:8139too:192.168.1.2|192.168.1.1
</PRE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> It is important to keep in mind that whatever devices you set up during the
configuration process will be promptly taken down after the configuration is
complete.  This setup is only used so you can retrieve configuration files over
the network, via http(s)/ftp/scp/sftp.  For more permanent network configuration, please
use the rc.inet1 file.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H3>Example</H3>

device1 = eth0:tulip:192.168.1.2|192.168.1.1

rc.M = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/rc.M
rc.inet1 = http://user:pass@config.sentry.net/all_nodes/rc.inet1

passwd = scp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/all_nodes/passwd

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Other Useful Configuration Directives</A>
</H2>

<P> Copy file /floppy/someconfig.conf to /etc/someconfig.conf -
<PRE>
     /floppy/someconfig.conf |= /etc/someconfig.conf

     OR, this does the same thing -

     /etc/someconfig.conf = /floppy/someconfig.conf

     and this is also possible(v1.3.0) -

     /etc/someconfig.conf = ftp://&lt;server>/someconfig.conf
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Make a symlink called /etc/someconfig.conf that points to
/etc/otherconfig.conf -</P>
<P>
<PRE>

</P>
<P>The include directive.  Grabs another sentry.conf file either from another
location -
<PRE>
     include = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/sentry.conf
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Keep in mind, however, that the include directive is one of the first directives
to be parsed.  Any configuration directives parsed from the included sentry.conf
file that conflict with directives in the previously parsed sentry.conf files
will clobber the old ones.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Putting it all together, managing multiple nodes from a single location.</A>
</H2>

<P> In order to manage multiple nodes at a single location, you can use a bare

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Example sentry.conf and disk images</A>
</H2>

<P> An example configuration disk image is available on the CDROM.  The disk is
an ext2 formatted disk, and is located in the '/SENTRY/images/' directory on the
CD.  There is also a very complete sentry.conf file on the disk which may help
clarify alot of these directives.  Use a command like the following to create
the configuration disk:</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Overview of Available Configuration Directives</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Replacing rc/config files</A>
</H2>

<P> To replace a file that is supported by the configuration scripts, you may
use the following syntax:
<PRE>
     filename_directive = /location/of/filename
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Where "filename_directive is one of the directives listed below, and the location
of the file is often '/floppy/filename'.  The file location can also be a URL.
The supported prefixed include "http://", "https://", "ftp://", "sftp://", and "scp://".</P>
<P>As previously mentioned, there are at least two Sentry Firewall CD branches with varying
names like "SENTRYCD" and "SENTRY-RH".  The only difference between these branches is
the "host" Linux distribution that is utilized.  And since Linux distributions utilize
different files during bootup, the accepted directives for the two branches vary.  For example,
a Slackware system utilizes files such as "rc.S" and "rc.M" to boot into single and multi-user
modes.  Other Linux distributions, such as Red Hat, utilize different files such as
"rc.sysinit" and various files located in /etc/rc.d/init.d/.  Therefore, when running
a sentrycd-RH system, which is not Slackware based, it would be pointless to have a
directive that states the following:
<PRE>
rc.M = /floppy/rc.M
</PRE>

since a non-Slackware system wouldn't know to do with a file called "rc.M". In any case, it
is for this reason that the configuration directives vary a bit between branches.  The
directives that are available can be found in the sentry.conf file in the SENTRY/scripts/cd-config/
directory, or on the website.</P>
<P><BR>The "sysconf_dir" and "xinetd_dir" are unique to the "SENTRYCD-RH" branch.  Unlike
the other directives, these are used to replace the files located in the /etc/xinetd.d/
and the /etc/sysconfig/ directories.  The /etc/sysconfig/ directory contains most of the
configuration files used by the init scripts(in /etc/rc.d/init.d/) on systems such as
Red Hat systems.</P>
<P>Example:
<PRE>
   sysconf_dir = /floppy/sysconfig
   or
   sysconf_dir = ftp://123.123.123.123/node1234/sysconfig
</PRE>

Please note that "/floppy/sysconfig" and "/node1234/sysconfig" are <I>directories</I>
that contain files you want placed in /etc/sysconfig/.  The "xinetd_dir" directive is
used in the same way.</P>

<P><BR><B>NOTE:</B> To replace files not supported by the configuration scripts, use the
'|=' file copy directive discussed below.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 'device' directive support</A>
</H2>

<P> Set up an ethernet device to use during configuration.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
     device[#] = [device_name]:[driver_name]:[IP_Address]&lt;|gateway>

<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Setting Up a Firewall</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Starting the Firewall</A>
</H2>

<P>Ok, so the project is called the Sentry *Firewall* CD.  So where's the firewall?
Well, it's important to note that this system is capable of quite a bit more than your
standard bootable floppy or CD firewall.  In fact it is a pretty complete Linux system
on a CD, and as with any Linux system the "firewall" is set up using scripts and various
userland utilities such as ipchains or iptables.</P>
<P>IPChains or IPTables firewall scripts generally take the form of shell scripts
that are customized by the user and run at boot-time.  If you already have a
ruleset for your firewall simply edit the "rc.firewall" directive in your
"sentry.conf" file to point to your firewall script on your floppy or on a
remote HTTP(S)/FTP/SCP/SFTP server as explained above.  The firewall will
then be run at boot time.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Using FWBuilder with the Sentry Firewall CD</A>
</H2>

<P>FWBuilder(http://www.FWBuilder.org/) is a firewall configuration and management
system.  The advantage to this application is that it provides a graphical user
interface to develop and modify firewall rulesets on various platforms using
various utilities.  The Firewall rulesets that are created with FWBuilder are
completely compatible with the Sentry Firewall CD, and with just about any Linux
firewall.</P>
<P>As with most Linux firewalls there are no X11 binaries or libraries on the Sentry
Firewall CD, so you will need to develop the firewall ruleset on a separate workstation
using fwbuilder and then upload the ruleset to the various firewalls/routers/nodes
on the network.  The following are the basic steps required to get your new fwbuilder
ruleset running on the Sentry CD:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Configure your new firewall to your liking with fwbuilder(duh).</LI>
<LI> Save your firewall.  Choose File->Save As, and choose an appropriate name.
The file will normally be saved as "whatever.xml".</LI>
<LI> Compile the firewall.  Choose Rules->Compile.  The ruleset will be compiled
and turned into a shell script called "whatever.fw".</LI>
<LI>    You will then want to copy "whatever.fw" to your configuration floppy and use
the "rc.firewall" configuration directive in your sentry.conf file to point to
your new firewall script.  The firewall script will be copied to
/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall during the configuration process and run at boot-time.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Please note that it is not necessary to reboot the Sentry Firewall CD every time
you update your firewall script.  You may simply upload the new script to the
Sentry Firewall and run it.  But just make sure that you copy the final draft of
your script to the configuration floppy so that it will be run at boot-time.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Using Webmin with the Sentry Firewall CD</A>
</H2>

<P>As of version 1.5.0-rc3 Webmin(http://www.webmin.com/) is available on the CD.
Among many of the other default modules available with webmin - of which not all
have been fully tested - Webmin includes two modules for generating and managing
your firewall setup.  These modules are located in the "Networking" section of the
webmin interface.  In this section you will see the "Linux Firewall" and "Shorewall
Firewall" modules, either of which are available for your use.</P>
<P>The addition of Webmin also adds four new configuration directives -
<PRE>
    start_webmin = &lt;enable | disable>           ## enable|disable webmin.  Default == disable.
    webmin_config = &lt;path/to/config>            ## Main webmin config(/etc/webmin/config).
    miniserv.conf = &lt;path/to/miniserv.conf>     ## Config file for webmin http(s) daemon.
    miniserv.pem = &lt;path/to/miniserv.pem>       ## SSL cert for webmin http(s) daemon.
                                                ## An SSL cert will be created by rc.webmin if
                                                ## one is not specified.
    miniserv.users = &lt;path/to/miniserv.users>   ## Password file used for webmin.
                                                ## Default user:pass is sentry:SENTRY.
                                                ## NOTE: If this file is not replaced webmin
                                                ## will NOT start!
</PRE>
</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> The modifications made by these web interface tools are, of course, not
permanent. Any files altered will need to be placed on a floppy or on a remote server and
declared in your sentry.conf file as explained in previous sections.</P>

<P>Many of these web interface tools do not simply generate a firewall script, but rather
set up a firewall and use the 'iptables-save' and 'iptables-restore' utilities to dump and
load the firewall.  The file created by 'iptables-save' must be loaded using 'iptables-restore',
it cannot be run like a shell script.  By default this file is placed in "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.save".
Once you configure your firewall to your liking you will need to place the rc.firewall.save file on a
floppy or a remote server and declare its location using the "rc.firewall.save" directive in the
sentry.conf file.  With the sentrycd and sentyrcd-devel branches, the rc.firewall and rc.firewall.save
files are normally run automatically at boot-time from rc.inet2.</P>

<P>As of verions 1.5.0-rc3 the Shorewall(http://www.shorewall.net/) firewall scripts are available on
the Sentry Firewall CD. Webmin also comes with a module to configure and set up Shorewall, although
Shorewall can be configured manually as well.  Shorewall utilizes a number of configuration files
located in /etc/shorewall. The sentry.conf file recognizes the "shorewall.conf" configuration directive,
but if any of the other configuration files in /etc/shorewall need to be replaced you will need to do
so manually using the "|=" configuration directive.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Other Sample Firewall Scripts and Tools</A>
</H2>

<P> Sample firewall scripts can be found in the /SENTRY/scripts/firewall
directory on the CD.  These are just a few firewall scripts I found on the
Internet and have put here for your convenience.  If you do a search on
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">google</A>
or
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">freshmeat.net</A>
you will probably find several others pretty easily.</P>

<P>I have also added "Easy Firewall Generator" (http://easyfwgen.morizot.net/) and
"IPTables Script Generator" (http://iptables.linux.dk/) to the CD.  These are PHP
scripts that can assist you in creating a ruleset for your Sentry Firewall CD system.
In order to view these you will need to start the Apache web server on a running Sentry
Firewall CD system, and then direct your browser to the IP address of your Sentry
Firewall.  The scripts should be available in the "firewall" directory.</P>

<P>Please note that these web-based scripts will often generate a script for you, but you
will still need to take that generated script and place at on a floppy or on a remote
server and edit the "rc.firewall" directive in the sentry.conf file to point to your
new script.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Troubleshooting</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Booting Problems</A>
</H2>

<P> Booting problems are generally rare, and generally only occur on old and buggy,
or somehow non-compliant hardware.  Booting problems can be associated with a number
of problems, depending upon at what point during the boot process the failure occurs.
The following are possible causes of failure when booting from a CD.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Old or buggy BIOSes that do not fully support the eltorito standard.  System
may fail to load the isolinux bootloader or the kernel.</LI>
<LI> Problematic CDROM drives can cause various problems when booting the CD.
CD may or may not boot, and will generally have trouble accessing files
on the CD.</LI>
<LI> Damaged CD, obviously can cause a number of problems, similar symptoms as
above.</LI>
<LI> Insufficient hardware resources.  Please see the "Minumum Requirements"
section of this howto for more information on what is required to boot
the CD.</LI>
<LI> In the case of booting the Sentry Firewall CD, old or buggy floppy disk
drives or damaged floppy disks can also result in serious problems, including
curruption of the data on the floppy disk.  The inability for the configuration
scripts to read and parse files contained on the floppy disk can seriously inhibit
the capability of the system to configure itself properly.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>In general, hardware issues cause the majority of problems during the boot process
of the Sentry Firewall CD, and may not always be easy to diagnose.  Generally, the
first step in debugging a general boot problem is to try and boot another CD in the
same machine to attempt to rule out a hardware problem.  And then attempt to boot
the Sentry Firewall CD in another machine to attempt to rule out damage to the CD.
If both these tests produce no negative results, then perhaps swap out the CDROM drives
in the two machines, if possible, and do the test again.  Then perhaps check out the
general mailing list(mentioned below) for further assistance.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Configuration Problems</A>
</H2>

<P> This section deals with configuration problems with the "sentry.conf" file.
The sentry.conf configuration file, as mentioned in previous sections, tells the
configuration scripts what to do during boot time to configure the running system.
Syntax errors in the script can cause a file to be misplaced, or for the directive
to not be parsed at all.</P>
<P>Error messages during the boot process of the Sentry Firewall CD can help greatly
in diagnosing potential syntax or other types of errors.  So watch the CD boot and
write down any error messages that may pop up.  Also, during bootup a logfile
detailing the configuration process is created at /var/log/SENTRY_LOG.  If
you can log in to the system after it has booted, then take a look at this file for
any obvious error messages.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Building a Custom Sentry CD</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> This section will attempt to describe how to create a custom Sentry Firewall
CDROM.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into every detail.  But at
the very least I will try and provide for you an overview of the CD creation
process.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 The development system(How I do it)</A>
</H2>

<P> My development system consists of two separate Linux installations of the
same distribution, depending on what branch I'm working on. First, I have a
very complete &lt;insert Linux distro here&gt; installation on my main hard
drive(/dev/hda).  I then have /dev/hdb1, upon which I have another, bare bones,
installation - this installation generally has no compiling tools or X stuff.</P>
<P>I usually have /dev/hdb1 mounted on /mnt, that's not a critical element,
but I thought I'd mention it since I will refer to /mnt alot from now on.  I
then have a directory called /CD-FW on the /dev/hdb1 installation, that is, if
/dev/hdb1 is mounted on /mnt, then the directory would be called /mnt/CD-FW/.
Throughout this entire process, the installation on /dev/hda is the live running
system, and it is from here that I compile the needed tools, kernels, etc and
basically run everything.</P>
<P>To make this easy for you, the Sentry Firewall CD ISO is basically an exact
copy of what's in /mnt/CD-FW/ on my hard drive.  I simply use the 'mkisofs'
utility on /mnt/CD-FW to create the ISO image.</P>
<P>If you simply want to get started, perhaps try the following steps:
<UL>
<LI> Install a basic slackware system on some other partition, /dev/hdb1 perhaps.</LI>
<LI> Reboot into your normal(linux) system and mount this new partition, let's say on /mnt.</LI>
<LI> Mount the Sentry CD somewhere, let's say on /mnt2</LI>
<LI> <B>type:</B> mkdir /mnt/CD-FW</LI>
<LI> <B>type:</B> cp -Rdp /mnt2/* /mnt/CD-FW/</LI>
<LI> <B>type:</B> find /mnt/CD-FW/ -name 'TRANS.TBL' -type f -print | xargs rm -f <BR>
This removes those 'TRANS.TBL' files that are created by mkisofs.</LI>
<LI> Unmount /mnt2</LI>
<LI> Run the following commands(in a script if you like) to update the /mnt/CD-FW/ directory:
<PRE>
  cp -Rdp /mnt/bin /mnt/CD-FW/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/sbin /mnt/CD-FW/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/lib /mnt/CD-FW/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/bin /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/sbin /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/local/bin /mnt/CD-FW/usr/local/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/lib /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/libexec /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/share /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
  cp -Rdp /mnt/usr/man /mnt/CD-FW/usr/
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> The above commands may spit out errors when working with certain
files(ie. hard links).  These errors are annoying, but they're not critical at all.</P>
<P>You now have a development system like, or similar to, my own :-)</P>
<P>Now, if you ever want to install an rpm update or a Slackware package update(with
upgradpkg), you can do the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@mybox:~# cd /mnt; chroot /mnt

root@mybox:/# upgradepkg update.tgz
or
root@mybox:/# rpm --upgrade update.rpm

$ exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Then, all I need to do is re-run the script mentioned above, the one that
copies all those files, to update the /mnt/CD-FW directory.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 The RAMdisk Image</A>
</H2>

<P> That's all nifty, but now comes the hard part... making the ramdisk.  If you
take a look at the /isolinux directory on the CDROM, you will see a bunch of
files, one of them is called 'initrd.img' - there are several others as well,
such as isolinux.cfg, message.txt, and isolinux.bin.  These files are required
by isolinux in order to work properly.  Take a look at those files and the
documentation that comes with syslinux to get a better idea of what all that
does.  In any case, the 'initrd.img' file is, in fact, the compressed ramdisk
image.</P>
<P>To take a look at the image, do something like the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ cp /cdrom/isolinux/initrd.img /tmp/initrd.img.gz
blah@wherever:~$ gzip -d /tmp/initrd.img.gz
blah@wherever:~$ mount -o loop /tmp/initrd.img /MOUNT_POINT
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In a nutshell, I use the file '/SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/mkrootdsk.sh' to create
the rootdisk.  Please read that file and the disclaimer before you decide to
use it.  It runs perfectly on my system, but may not run well at all on yours.
It basically attempts to create a rootdisk image to use with the Sentry CD, but
it is very long and may be somewhat difficult to comprehend at times.  This is
what happens when I start hacking around and fail to utilize proper child safety
restraints.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Making the ISO Image</A>
</H2>

<P> The next file I use is called 'mkiso.sh'.  The script generally just
declares a few variables and runs the 'mkisofs' utility.  The command I normally
run looks like the following:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@mybox:~# cd /mnt/CD-FW
root@mybox:/mnt/CD-FW# mkisofs -o sentrycd.iso -R -V "Sentry Firewall CD [v1.x.x]" -v \
   -T -d -D -N \
   -b isolinux/isolinux.bin \
   -c isolinux/eltorito.cat \
   -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
   -A "Sentry Firewall CD v1.x.x" .
........
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>And that's it, I burn the CD and test it.  For reference, the following
files are available on the CDROM and online at
<A HREF="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">http://www.SentryFirewall.com/</A>
<UL>
<LI> /SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/mkrootdsk.sh (builds the rootdisk)</LI>
<LI> /SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/mkiso.sh     (builds final ISO image)</LI>
<LI> /SENTRY/scripts/MK-CD/record-cd.sh (burns the ISO to a CD)</LI>

<H2><A NAME="s9">9. More About the Sentry Firewall Project</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Goals</A>
</H2>

<P> The general goal of this project is mentioned several times within the documentation.  That is simply, to build
a bootable CDROM-based system that can be easily and dynamically configured.  In the end, I wanted the
configuration to rival that of any commercial router that utilizes configuration files(ie. Cisco).  I also wanted
the system to be simple, secure, and highly functional in a large number of operating environments - not just
as a firewall.  This, of course, has proven to be a difficult balance to maintain.</P>
<P>At the present time, the basic goals have been fulfilled.  However, I believe there is still a great deal of
development that can and needs to be done in order for the Sentry Firewall to be a truly diverse Linux
distribution.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Supporting the Project</A>
</H2>

<P> There are various ways one can support this project.  The easiest and most common way is to simply
utilize the system in a test or production environment and send me suggestions, bugs, or other such
feedback.  For those interested in assisting with the enhancement of any of the Sentry Firewall CD
branches, please check out the TODO file located in /SENTRY/docs/TODO on the CD image, or online at

</H2>

<P> The Sentry Firewall project has only ever had a single developer, Stephen Zarkos(me) of Bellevue, Washington(USA).
I began work on the project around April of 2000, probably ruining 200 CD-Rs before I got my first stable
Sentry Firewall CD.  And for the last two years I have been continuing to develop, enhance and maintain the project -
give or take a few months here and there while I took a short hiatus(marriage, education, etc).</P>
<P>From the beginning, this project has proven to be quite popular, and has received a great deal of support
and feedback from its loyal users.  This kind of support has proven invaluable, and has kept me motivated
to continue to develop this project.  There is nothing I would rather do right now than work on and enhance
this system, however since I do not get paid to develop this project, it is only a part-time endeavor.
Even so, the positive comments and feedback I receive has without a doubt made this the most enjoyable project
I have ever been a part of.</P>
