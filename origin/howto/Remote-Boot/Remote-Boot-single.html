<EM>This document describes how to set up a very robust and secure server-based
configuration for a cluster of PCs, allowing each client to choose
at boot-time which operating system to run. The key of this configuration
is a bootprom based program, which let the user choose at boot time one of several boot images. This configuration is applicable using
InCom TCP/IP Bootprom (add-on for most network cards) or any PXE-compliant Boot ROM (ready-to-use in most recent PC with built-in
network cards).

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. What has changed...</A></H2>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 ...since version 2.x ?</A>
</H2>

<P>To say it frankly, almost everything. The underlying concepts are the same, but
the software part has been completly redesigned to overcome the limitations
of previous versions and to make it easier to use. An highlight of the new
features :
<UL>
<LI>All functions (bpmenu, bpclean, bpunzip) are encompassed in a single
program.</LI>
<LI>The program can run not only from the boot rom, but also under DOS,
Windows 95 and Linux.</LI>
<LI>The program can now restore images of FAT16, FAT32 and EXT2FS
partitions. If someone want to write NTFS support, let me know...
For now, NT users still have to stick to FAT16.</LI>
<LI>The program can not only restore disk images but also add and patch
individual files in order to customize the client behaviour.</LI>
<LI>Disk images are not any more bound to 87 MB. They are now 
file-system independant archives.</LI>
<LI>We provide a mean for automatically downloading a disk image to
an arbitrary big number of clients at the same time (broadcast).</LI>
<LI>You can now write your own secure boot script, that will determine
the behaviour of the machine before the real boot.</LI>
<LI>You can now boot any Linux kernel, without 
applying any patch. Its is also possible to provide a 
command line and a ramdisk image.</LI>
<LI>You can authenticate users at boot time using a Unix, NT or Radius
server and deny them any access to the machine.</LI>
<LI>Full national language support is included.</LI>
<LI>And many, many other new features...</LI>
</UL>

<DL>
<DT><B>Is there a program for converting old archives to the new format ?</B><DD>
<P>No, because the internal format is radically different. But you can easily
do the conversion by yourself: 
<OL>
<LI>Boot an old image (unzip it to your disk)</LI>
<LI>Remove calls to the old <CODE>unzipreg</CODE> utility and replace them
by the adequate <CODE>patch</CODE> commands (it is very easy, see
the detailed instructions below)</LI>
<LI>Run the new <CODE>mrzip</CODE> program to create a new-style disk image</LI>
</OL>
</P>
</DL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 ...since version 3.0 ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Version 3.0 was the beta-release. A dozen of sites around the world have
tested it during a month and given much of their time to help us finding
bugs and to suggest enhancements. Thanks to all of them for their patience, 
and in particular to Maciek Uhlig, Dick Velders and Jeff Teeters.</P>
<P>A few minor features have been added since 3.01, such as support for diskless
Linux boot (by disabling the cache).</P>
<P>Version 3.10 introduced compatibility with Intel's <EM>Wired for Management
1.1a</EM> NetPC standard. The tools now work with any PXE-compliant boot ROM 
(as are most on-board boot ROMs) available today. Thanks to 
<A HREF="http://www.incom.de/">InCom GmbH</A> for giving us the PXE
bootprom that permitted this developpment. We also succesfully tested
the tools with the PXE Boot ROM that I found incidentally in my Dell
computer with onboard network card (called LanDesk Service Agent).</P>
<P>Version 3.11 to 3.12 added UNIX server-side tools (a PXE Proxy DHCP server
for Solaris and Linux, and an enhanced TFTP server for Linux), as well as
detailled informations on server-side setup and the PXE booting process.</P>
<P>Version 3.13 added Advanced Power Management support (PowerOff command).</P>
<P>Version 3.14 added minor enhancements and some corrections. We fixed a problem
with the terminal under RedHat 5.1, and another problem in the syntax of
the "if" command. We added some features suggested by the Laboratori de
Càlcul de la Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona (LCFIB) :
<UL>
<LI>A new APM variable let you know if your system support the Advanced
Power Management (i.e it supports the poweroff command).</LI>
<LI>A "beep" command.</LI>
<LI>A new parameter to DrawWindow, to include a title at the window
creation. You can now do DrawWindow 200 200 400 200 "Title".</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Version 3.15 added full VESA support. BpBatch now support several video modes,
to accomodate old computers not being able to display 800x600 graphics. A new
parameter has been added to InitGraph to specify the video mode, and a list
of detected video mode can be retrieved from the new VESA-Modes variable.</P>
<P>Version 3.16 fixes the following bugs:
<UL>
<LI>"Malloc failed" during the Fullunzip process of a multiple fragments
image.
Many thanks to Christian Meyer for his collaboration.</LI>
<LI>A bug which prevented the linux version of MrBatch to properly
fullunzip images. This bug was located in the low-level functions of
MrBatch, so it may fix other problems encountered in the <EM>linux</EM> version
of MrBatch.
Many thanks to Jeff Teeters for his collaboration.</LI>
<LI>An error in the codepage translation tables. This bug was found by
the Laboratori de Càlcul de la Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona (LCFIB). 
You can find the bug report in the BpBatch forum.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Version 3.17 adds some minor features and fixes bugs:
<UL>
<LI>Fullunzip was turning Extended Memory off</LI>
<LI>Booting on the RedHat boot disk now works </LI>
<LI>When extracting images with a large number of directories, the 
resulting FAT file system was corrupted.</LI>
<LI>We added retries to text TFTP transfers. BpBatch will now retry 
three times before saying "Could not transfer the file".</LI>
<LI>Timestamps are now correctly updated in FAT. (thank to Francis Chan)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Version 3.18 fixes a bug with the IncrUnzip function. Thanks to
Gary Pike for its collaboration.</P>
<P>Version 3.19 fixed a bug in the error handling of the <CODE>delete</CODE> command
on ext2fs, as well as the inappropriate handling of names starting with
A: under Linux. The following new features were also added:
<UL>
<LI>A new <CODE>if valid disk:partition</CODE> syntax can be used to check
if a partition has been formatted</LI>
<LI>FAT32 disk images are now fully functional (they now boot properly)</LI>
<LI>Linux EXT2 partitions bigger than 2 GB are now supported</LI>
<LI>Linux Swap partitions bigger than 128 MB are now supported (this
feature needs a recent kernel, at least 2.1.x)</LI>
<LI>FullUnzip is now also possible without a cache partition, by
setting <CODE>CacheNever</CODE> to <CODE>"ON"</CODE>. This might be
usefull for a unique installation, but is not recommended in
general is it results in a high network load.</LI>
</UL>

Thanks to Ruben Schattevoy for its help and contributions to this release.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>The configuration described here was developped since Summer 1996 at the
CUI, University of Geneva. The Computer Science Department uses several
servers and a number of PCs, which fall into two classes:
<UL>
<LI>computers devoted to students</LI>
<LI>computers devoted to research and teaching assistants</LI>
</UL>

We developped the current configuration with the following aims:
<UL>
<LI>Every computer should be able to run under Linux, DOS, Windows 3.1, 
Windows 95 or Windows NT. One should be able to choose the desired 
operating system for each session.</LI>
<LI>All softwares, including operating systems, should be take from the 
server, in order to facilitate the installations and upgrades.</LI>
<LI>Clients computers should be able to run without any write-access on 
the server (for security reasons), except for their home directory.</LI>
<LI>Client-side configuration should be reduced to its very minimum.
Clients should automatically get their IP configuration parameters
from the server, and this information should be located in 
a single file, used for all operating systems.</LI>
<LI>Since almost every computer now has a hard-disk,
clients should be able to take profit of it for reducing network
load and as temporary storage space for the user.</LI>
<LI>Users <EM>must</EM> have a login to be able to use
any of the computers.</LI>
<LI>The login should be the same
for all operating system and should let the user access its
unique home directory, common to all operating systems.</LI>
<LI>Student (and secretary :-) computers should be fully cleaned up 
at each start. That is,
the PC should always look like if it were just installed.</LI>
<LI>Every computer has to be protected from virus attacks.</LI>
</UL>

These constraints lead us to base our configuration on bootprom
tools. We first developped new tools for the excellent
<A HREF="http://www.incom.de/products_en.shtml">TCP/IP Bootprom</A>
from 
<A HREF="http://www.incom.de">InCom GmbH</A>.
Now that a standard for preboot execution environments as finally emerged,
we ported the tools so that it now also works for any PXE-compliant
bootprom. PXE boot roms, also called LanDesk Service Agent, are now 
distributed with almost all on-board network adapter.
For more info on PXE and Intel <EM>Wired for Management</EM> standard
in general, read from <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/managedpc">http://www.intel.com/managedpc</A></CODE>. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Boot ROM and Hard-disk</A>
</H2>

<P>Bootproms exist for quite a long time, but until recently, they were
solely used with diskless computers. Since 1996, this How-to has been 
claiming that bootproms are even more interesting 
for computers which have a local harddisk, since they allow to take profit
of both sides:
<UL>
<LI>A boot rom make the configurations more robust, since it ensure
that the computer will always boot the same way, no matter
any virus or partition table crash. It can be used, as
we did, to cleanup the harddisk even before the operating system
is loaded.</LI>
<LI>A local harddisk make the configuration more efficient, since
it can reduce the network trafic through caching, and allows
for efficient swap.</LI>
</UL>

Today, we have the pleasure to see that all computer manufacturers have
come to the same point and provide boot roms as part of new computer
standards.</P>
<P>Note that you can still use the tools described below in an <EM>old
fashioned</EM> way, that is as a simple kernel/ramdisk loader, even for
diskless computers. However, we do not encourage this use.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 The Network</A>
</H2>

<P>The University of Geneva owns a class B domain, subdivided into several
subnets. The CUI uses four subnets, among them one is dedicated to students.</P>
<P>Originally, our PCs were concerned about two network protocols: IPX and IP.
On the IPX side, we used a single Novell Netware 3 server for sharing software
and users files for DOS and Windows. On the IP side, we used a SUN server
for sharing software and users partitions for Linux, with NFS.</P>
<P>In our latest configuration, we do not any more use IPX. There is a single
Unix server (which could be Linux as well as a SUN), sharing software
and user files using NFS for Linux clients and using SMB (NetBIOS) over
TCP/IP for Dos and Windows clients. In this way, we have a single
home directory used by all operating systems.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 How it Works</A>
</H2>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>When a client PC is turned on, it first performs the traditional system 
checks before the TCP/IP Bootprom or PXE Boot ROM takes the control.</LI>
<LI>The bootprom issues a BOOTP/DHCP request in order to get its IP 
configuration parameters.</LI>
<LI>If the server knows the PC issuing the request, it will send
back a BOOTP/DHCP reply with informations such as the client's IP
address, the default gateway, and which bootdisk image to use.</LI>
<LI>In case of a PXE boot ROM, there might be some more exchanges between
the client and the server to determine installation parameters.</LI>
<LI>The bootprom then downloads the boot image from the
server using the TFTP protocol. The boot image happens to be
a small program called <CODE>bpbatch</CODE>, our boot-time batch
file interpreter.</LI>
<LI>The batch interpreter is started. At this time, it is almost
alone in the computer memory. There is no operating system loaded,
except the preboot execution environment (offered by the Boot ROM).</LI>
<LI>The batch interpreter look in the BOOTP/DHCP reply for command-line
options, and in particular for the name of the batch to execute.</LI>
<LI>According to the instructions in the batch file, it will for
instance:
<OL>
<LI>Load a national keyboard mapping</LI>
<LI>Authenticate the user according to a remote server
(Unix, Radius or Windows NT)</LI>
<LI>Let the user choose between the available operating systems</LI>
<LI>According to the operating system choosen, repartition
the hard-disk and quick-format some partitions</LI>
<LI>Check if an up-to-date compressed image of the selected OS
is present at the end of the disk. If not, it download
it using TFTP</LI>
<LI>Uncompress the selected OS to the main partition</LI>
<LI>If the selected OS is Linux, load a kernel and start it</LI>
<LI>If the selected OS is DOS or Windows, simply let the computer
boot on its fresh new hard-disk</LI>
</OL>

For <B>DOS and Windows 3.1</B>, we use the
freely available Microsoft LanManager for DOS (search the
network for the mirror nearest to you; the distribution
consists of three files named <CODE>disk1</CODE> to <CODE>disk4</CODE>)
as SMB client. Microsoft LanManager supports dynamic
configuration using DHCP. After logging in, the user 
is faced to DOS, and can start Windows 3.1 by typing 
the traditional <CODE>win</CODE> command. Note that at this point,
DOS and Windows 3.1 appear to be installed locally.

For <B>Windows 95 and Windows NT</B>, we also use Microsoft SMB client 
(called <I>Client for the Microsoft Network</I>), that supports
dynamic configuration using DHCP. We reduce network load using
<A HREF="http://www.lancache.com">Shared LAN Cache</A>,
a nice and powerful network-to-disk cache program.</LI>
</OL>

Students computers can be turned off <EM>the hard way</EM> at any time
without risks, since the hard disk is reinitialized at each start.</P>
<P>For "safe" computers (ie. for assistants computers), 
once the computer has been booted once using the above described system,
the boot script simply redirect the boot to the local hard-disk,
without cleaning it again. This allow users to leave
data on their local hard disk. But whenever the configuration gets corrupted,
the user can simply choose from the boot menu in order to have
a fresh installation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. The Configuration How-To</A></H2>

<P>First, arrange to have the following two machines within arm's reach:
<UL>
<LI>the <B>server</B>, usually a Unix or Windows NT machine</LI>
<LI>the <B>client</B>, a PC with a bootprom enabled, and nothing
valuable on the hard disk. </LI>
</UL>

If you want to test the configuration but you do not yet have a 
bootprom, you can download the TCP/IP BootProm demo diskette 
from InCom GmbH at
<CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.incom.de">http://www.incom.de</A></CODE>.
This diskette will make your computer behave like if it had a TCP/IP
Bootprom plugged in.</P>
<P>If you already have a Boot ROM, you need to enable it. If you are using Incom
TCP/IP Bootprom, you can do that using a special program from your 
network card manufacturer. If you have a PXE Bootprom, you can do it
simply from BIOS setup, by changing the default boot device.</P>
<P>For student computers, we configured the boot on network
first, and disabled hard-disk and floppy-disk boot. For assistant
computers, we also configured network-boot first,
but we allow hard-disk and floppy-disk boot.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Server-side configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>On the server, you will need the following services:
<OL>
<LI>A BOOTP/DHCP server</LI>
<LI>May be a Proxy DHCP server</LI>
<LI>A TFTP server</LI>
</OL>

<B>Note for PXE Boot ROM users:</B> We found after severals hours of tedious
search that PXE Boot ROMs with version before 0.99
do not follow the IP protocol and
discard all packets that have the <EM>Don't Fragment</EM> (DF) flag set.
That means, you will have to disable <EM>Path MTU Discovery</EM> on the server,
or the Boot ROM will not see any of its packets. On Solaris, use 
<CODE>ndd /dev/ip ip_path_mtu_discovery</CODE> to see if you have it enabled
and <CODE>ndd -set /dev/ip ip_path_mtu_discovery 0</CODE> to disable it.
However, this fix only works for non-broadcast packets (ask SUN why...).
That means, it will work for TFTP but not for DHCP :-(. Intel has recently 
fixed this bug, and if you bought your computer after June 1998, you surely
have a corrected PXE implementation.</P>

<H3>Setting up DHCP</H3>

<P>The role of the DHCP server is to give to the client an IP
address and to make it load the
file named <CODE>bpbatch.P</CODE> from the TFTP server.
DHCP is a superprotocol over BOOTP. If you are using InCom
TCP/IP Bootprom, you may live without DHCP (using an old BOOTP server).</P>
<P>On Windows NT, you will probably use the native DHCP server.
If you are using InCom TCP/IP Bootprom, you will have to use
a special trick to specify the boot file name (get more info
from InCom WWW site). If you are using a PXE Bootrom, you will
need a Proxy DHCP server, but no other trick is needed as
the boot file name will be provided by the Proxy DHCP server.</P>
<P>On Linux, the best choice is the standard DHCP server from the
Internet Software Consortium. If you are
using a PXE Bootrom, in addition to the usual options, you will need
to add the following ones:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>option dhcp-class-identifier "PXEClient"</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>option vendor-encapsulated-options ff;</CODE></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>On Solaris, you can either use the Internet Software Consortium
DHCP server
(available on the Web), or use Solaris DHCP server (available
since Solaris 2.5). However, as Solaris DHCP server does not seems
to be able to insert a client class identifier in its DHCP offer,
you must install a Proxy DHCP server. Morever, this Proxy DHCP server
must reside on another computer since Solaris DHCP server locks
the DHCP port.</P>
<P>We suggest giving infinite lease time for remote-boot clients.
Don't forget that BOOTP/DHCP requests are bounded by subnets. If the client
and the server do not reside on the same subnet, you should install
a BOOTP/DHCP Relay agent on any computer between the two. 
For now, just assume that both machines are on the same subnet.</P>

<H3>Setting up a Proxy DHCP</H3>

<P>The role of the Proxy DHCP server is to overcome limitions of some DHCP
servers and to provide PXE specific extensions. A proxy DHCP server
only makes sense for a PXE Boot rom.</P>
<P>As BpBatch itself is quite powerfull, 
you wont need to use any PXE specific DHCP extension (menus, etc.).
However, if your DHCP server is not able to show minimal PXE compliance,
you will need a Proxy DHCP server or your PXE Boot ROM will not accept
to go further.</P>
<P>On Windows NT, you can try to use Intel WfM PDK (available from their
web site), but it is not very easy to use. We rather suggest having
a Linux machine on the subnet and using our small Proxy DHCP.
The major advantage of our Proxy DHCP Server for BpBatch is that
our server will let you specify an option 155 vendor tag that will
be interpreted by BpBatch as a command line.</P>
<P>On Linux and Solaris, you can run our Proxy DHCP program, that simply
takes as argument the TFTP server IP address, boot file name and
optional arguments, and does everything for you.
If the DHCP port on the server is already requested by another daemon,
the proxy DHCP server will run on port 4011. In this case, it is
necessary that the other daemon on DHCP port answer a DHCP offer with
client class <CODE>PXEClient</CODE> so that the PXE client knows that it must
try on port 4011.</P>
<P>If you want to understand better PXE extensions to DHCP, there is
an extensive description available on Intel WWW site. However, be warned
that the documents are quite confusing, as the protocol has been
extended to a number of optional stages, in order to allow for a
maximal flexibility. The key to understand it is that all what a PXE
client needs is a complete <EM>enhanced DHCP answer</EM>. If it receives
only a standard DHCP offer, it will look further until it gets
<OL>
<LI>a client class (T60) set to <CODE>PXEClient</CODE></LI>
<LI>vendor encapsulated options (T43) (possibly empty, ie. hex <CODE>ff</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>a non-empty boot filename</LI>
</OL>

The PXE specific negociation ends as soon as all these infos are received,
but can lead to a very complex process (install server discovery, etc.)
if some are missing.</P>

<H3>Setting up TFTP</H3>

<P>The TFTP server is a very simple file server. In its basic version,
TFTP use 512 bytes data blocks, which are quite inefficients.
InCom TCP/IP Bootprom and PXE Boot ROMs allow to use larger
blocks (1408 bytes), which speeds up transfers a lot. However,
this can only work with an enhanced TFTP server.</P>
<P>On Windows NT, we suggest using InCom enhanced TFTP server, available
on their web site.</P>
<P>On Linux, you can use our enhanced TFTP server, available at
<CODE>
<A HREF="soft/etftpd.tar.gz">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/etftpd.tar.gz</A></CODE>.</P>
<P>On Solaris, you should use InCom enhanced TFTP serer, available
on the utility disk provided with the TCP/IP Bootprom.</P>
<P><B>If you prefer using a standard TFTP daemon, remove
the <CODE>P</CODE> in all boot image name extensions, in order to tell the
Bootprom to use only the standard TFTP port (This trick was introduced
by InCom GmbH for the TCP/IP Bootprom. We still use it as an easy way
to select the default TFTP port with PXE bootproms).</B></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Client-side configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>First, we will do set up the part common to all operating systems, ie.
the batch-file interpreter.
Then, for each operating system, we will go through the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Setup a stand-alone client</LI>
<LI>Save its configuration on the server</LI>
<LI>Test it as a remote-boot client</LI>
<LI>Adapt it so that it works for any similar client machine</LI>
</OL>

Once this is done, you will be able to setup any supplemental 
client just by plugging a Boot ROM in it (or buying a Wired for Management
ready computer...) and adding one line
in the DHCP configuration file.</P>
<P>Our examples assume that you have a hard disk of 1.4 Gb or more.
If you have less, reduce the sizes of the partitions, but remember
the you need to leave a few hundreds megabytes unallocated (that is,
the last partition must not take up to the last cylinder) to leave
free room for the special cache partition. Moreover, as the cache always
starts at the cylinder following the last allocated cylinder, if you
do not use the same total size for all your tests, you will have to
download several times the same files (the cache will be automatically
cleared).</P>
<P>Never despair. If you can't get it to work, first look in the 
<EM>Troubleshooting</EM> section if your problem is not already solved
(get the latest version from the Web). 
Then, take a look in the BpBatch forum. Perhaps someone else had the
same troubles as you have, and the answer can be found in the forum.
Forum's URL :
<CODE>
<A HREF="forum/">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/forum/</A></CODE>.
If it still does not work, think about monitoring network traffic
for network related problems (use <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> on Linux or
<CODE>snoop</CODE> on Solaris). If you really cannot get it to work,
you can send an E-mail to <CODE>David.Clerc@cui.unige.ch</CODE> or
<CODE>Marc.VuilleumierStuckelberg@cui.unige.ch</CODE>.
If your problem is strictly related with the remote-boot configuration
and if we are not overflowed, we will try to solve your problem.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Setting Up the Boot Process</A>
</H2>

<P>Get the <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> software, either as <CODE>.zip</CODE> or as <CODE>.tar.gz</CODE>.
The executables are available at
<UL>
<LI><CODE>
<A HREF="soft/bpb-exe.zip">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/bpb-exe.zip</A></CODE></LI>

<A HREF="soft/bpb-exe.tar.gz">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/bpb-exe.tar.gz</A></CODE></LI>
</UL>

The source code (Assembler and C) is also available on request.</P>
<P>In the server <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> directory, put the following three special
boot images, which together make our pre-boot batch file interpreter:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>bpbatch.P</CODE>, the dynamic loader (respect the uppercase !)</LI>
<LI><CODE>bpbatch.ovl</CODE>, the relocated interpreter</LI>
<LI><CODE>bpbatch.hlp</CODE>, the on-line help file</LI>
</UL>

Then add an entry in the DHCP configuration file for your client, with
the boot file set to <CODE>"bpbatch.P"</CODE>. Define a vendor option tag 155
(decimal) with the value <CODE>"-i"</CODE>
(on the standard DHCP server, this is done by the following
command: <CODE>option option-155 "-i";</CODE>). It is interpreted by <CODE>bpbatch</CODE>
as the command line, and <CODE>-i</CODE> stands for "interactive".</P>
<P>Boot the client computer. You might shortly see
<UL>
<LI>The Boot ROM copyright</LI>
<LI>The string <CODE>DHCP</CODE> while the client waits for a DHCP reply</LI>
<LI>The string <CODE>TFTP</CODE> while the client waits for the first TFTP packet</LI>
<LI>The string <CODE>Loading BpBatch</CODE> while the loader download the
interpreter</LI>
<LI>And finaly our banner, followed by a nice <I>greather-than</I> prompt</LI>
</UL>

Congratulations ! You have started the batch interpreter...
If you are curious about what you can do with it, continue reading
the next section. If you are on a hurry, skip it and go directly
install the operating system of your choice. If you have any doubt
about a command within the interpreter, type <CODE>help</CODE>.</P>
<P>Note that you can run the same interpreter within DOS and Linux by
running the <CODE>MrBatch</CODE> program. There are a only very few differences
(the Linux version do not have graphics support and the DOS version
can only send BOOTP and TFTP requests if the BootProm is not hidden
by the operating system).</P>
<P>It may be a good idea to read now the section about the
<EM>Syntax Rules</EM> of <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>, and in particular the paragraphs
on <EM>File References</EM> and on <EM>The Cache Filesystem</EM>.
This will help you understand the examples.</P>
<P>Once all operating systems will be set up, you will have to make a
menu to let the user choose the one he wants. You should be able
to discover by yourself how to make such a menu. All
necessary commands are documented at the end of this document.</P>

<H3>Discovering BpBatch</H3>

<P>Try to type <CODE>LogVars</CODE>. You should get about thirty variables
listed. Roughly, the first are BpBatch settings, then come
all parameters extracted from the BOOTP/DHCP reply, and the last
variable is a list of disks sizes, in Megabytes.</P>
<P>Type <CODE>GetPartitions part</CODE>, then <CODE>LogVars</CODE> again. There should be
one more variable containing the list of defined partitions on your
first hard-drive. Assuming that the first partition is either
BIGDOS, FAT32 or LINUX-EXT2, try <CODE>LogDir "{:1}"</CODE> to get the
content of the root directory, then <CODE>LogDir "{:1}/usr"</CODE> if
there is an <CODE>usr</CODE> directory. You can even try 
<CODE>LogTree "{:1}/etc"</CODE> to get a directory tree.</P>
<P>Put a GIF file (format GIF-87a, interlaced or not, but NOT GIF-89a)
on your TFTP server. We will suppose that the file is named <CODE>image.gif</CODE>.
You can copy it wherever you want with the following command:
<CODE>Copy "image.gif" "{:1}/temp/image.gif"</CODE>. Or you can use it
directly from the server. Now type <CODE>Logvars "V*"</CODE> and look at
the value of the <CODE>VESA</CODE> variable. If it is <CODE>On</CODE>, which is most
probable, that means you have a VESA-compliant video adapter. You can list
the available video modes using <CODE>Echo "$VESA-Modes"</CODE>. To display your 
image try the following command: <CODE>DrawGif "image.gif"</CODE>. 
The image should be on the upper
left corner of the screen. You can draw it on another place by specifying
X and Y coordinates after the image name. You can also draw text
with <CODE>DrawText 200 200 "Hello world" yellow</CODE>. Or draw an empty
window with <CODE>DrawWindow 200 200 300 150</CODE>. To insert a title when you
create a new window, try <CODE>DrawWindow 200 200 300 150 "My Window"</CODE>.
When you are tired of graphic mode, simply type <CODE>CloseGraph</CODE>.</P>
<P>Note on graphics : by default, all graphical routines work in the 800x600
VESA mode (with 256 colors), which is the first field of the <CODE>VESA-Modes</CODE>
variable. If you want to use a different video mode, change the variable in
order to have the requested video mode as the first field of the list.</P>
<P>Now take a text editor, and create a file named <CODE>test.bpb</CODE>
in the <CODE>tftpboot</CODE> directory with the following content:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Setting Up Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to set up Linux, you will need to boot the floppy disk
provided with the RedHat Linux distribution. BpBatch includes a
command that can redirect the boot to the floppy: <CODE>FloppyBoot</CODE>.</P>
<P>Set up 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat Linux</A> on your client, with network support,
and any packages you may want. You may want to recompile the
kernel to better fit your hardware, but it is not necessary.</P>

<H3>Configuring the Client</H3>

<P>It is probably a good idea to include BOOTP support to the kernel, so
that you do not have to customize the client IP address manually.</P>
<P>In order to reduce network load, you might also want to setup the
<CODE>filecache</CODE> for caching on the hard disk files that are
loaded by NFS. 
Roughly, the principle of the filecache
is that whenever a symbolic link from the <CODE>cache</CODE> subdirectory
is followed, it is replaced by its target. If the target is itself a
subdirectory, each entry of the subdirectory becomes a symbolic link
to the original entry of the foreign filesystem.
The filecache has been written by Unifix GmbH, and is part of 
Unifix Linux 2.0. It is freely distributable, and you can get the
necessary files from <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/filecache.tar.gz">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/filecache.tar.gz</A></CODE>.
In order to use the filecache, you have to
<UL>
<LI>apply a patch to the kernel (file <CODE>patch-filecache</CODE>),
enable filecache support through <CODE>make config</CODE> or whatever
you prefer, and recompile the kernel</LI>
<LI>copy the filecache binary file to <CODE>/sbin</CODE></LI>
<LI>create a mount point called <CODE>/mnt/nfs</CODE> (using <CODE>mkdir</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>copy <CODE>filecache.conf</CODE> to <CODE>/etc</CODE>. This file contains
the following lines:
<PRE>
Max 100 MB 50 % #
Cache /mnt/nfs/usr /usr
Cache /mnt/nfs/opt /opt
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>copy the content of <CODE>/usr</CODE> and <CODE>/opt</CODE> to the server, 
export them read-only
with <CODE>anon=0</CODE> (for allowing root access) and mount them under
<CODE>/mnt/nfs</CODE> (add a line for that in <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>rename <CODE>/usr</CODE> as <CODE>/usr.orig</CODE></LI>
<LI>link <CODE>/usr</CODE> to <CODE>/mnt/nfs/usr</CODE></LI>
<LI>rename <CODE>/opt</CODE> as <CODE>/opt.orig</CODE></LI>
<LI>link <CODE>/opt</CODE> to <CODE>/mnt/nfs/opt</CODE></LI>
<LI>ensure that <CODE>/usr</CODE> and <CODE>/opt</CODE> are not empty and contains
the correct directories</LI>
<LI>recursively remove <CODE>/usr.orig</CODE> and <CODE>/opt.orig</CODE></LI>
<LI>copy <CODE>filecache.init</CODE> to <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d</CODE></LI>
<LI>And finally link <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S35filecache</CODE> to <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/filecache.init</CODE></LI>
</UL>

If you successfully followed each of these steps, you should have the
filecache working next time you boot, as long as you do not forget to
use your patched kernel.</P>

<H3>Testing the Configuration</H3>

<P>Copy your compressed kernel image (<CODE>zImage</CODE>, <CODE>bzImage</CODE>, <CODE>vmlinuz</CODE>
or whatever you call it) to the 
server <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> directory as <CODE>linux.krn</CODE>. If you had to unplug
the bootprom from the PC, you can now plug it again. When <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>
starts, type <CODE>LinuxBoot "linux.krn" "root=/dev/hda1 BOOT_IMAGE=linux"</CODE>
(assuming
that the root ext2 filesystem is on the first partition). Alternatively,
if you did setup your configuration on a computer without bootprom,
just boot let it boot using the loader you installed (lilo, ...). But
in the later case, if you want the filecache to work, you should have
explicitely installed your kernel with filecache support at the right place.</P>
<P>Wait until the system comes up.
If you installed the filecache, you can check that <CODE>/usr</CODE> has
exploded into a directory with some symlinks and some already-exploded
directories. Now start the programs that the end-users will use most of 
the time, in order to load them once for all to the hard disk.</P>
<P>You can still make adjustements to your configuration, like on
any stand-alone linux station.</P>

<H3>Building the Disk Image</H3>

<P>When you are happy with your configuration, login as <CODE>root</CODE>,
go to the <CODE>/tmp</CODE> directory and
run our <CODE>mrzip</CODE> program.
<CODE>MrZip</CODE> is a command interpreter like <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>, but it can
understand more commands than <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> does. In particular, it
can understand the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
showlog
filter -"tmp/*"
filter -"var/log/*"
fullzip "/" "/tmp/linux.imz"
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will create a disk image in <CODE>/tmp/linux.imz</CODE>. Move it to
the server <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> directory. Then copy the following
batch file to <CODE>/tftpboot/linux.bpb</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
hidelog
setpartitions "linux-ext2:992 linux-swap:32"
fullunzip "linux.imz" 1
clean 2
linuxboot "linux.krn" "root=/dev/hda1 BOOT_IMAGE=linux"
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>BOOT_IMAGE</CODE> argument is to stay compatible with <CODE>lilo</CODE> for
RedHat 5.1 and later <CODE>rc.sysinit</CODE>.</P>
<P>Your remote-boot linux configuration is ready ! You can now either
set the BOOTP-option-155 to <CODE>"linux"</CODE>, or type <CODE>include "linux.bpb"</CODE>
from within BpBatch to test it.</P>

<H3>System Maintenance and Upgrades</H3>

<P>If you want later to upgrade software, install bug fixes and 
security fixes, proceed as follow:
<UL>
<LI>Remote-boot a client computer to get a fresh linux install</LI>
<LI>Make your changes</LI>
<LI>Redo the disk image</LI>
<LI>Copy the new image in place of the old one on the server</LI>
</UL>

That means, you can upgrade software on your server-based configuration
as if it were a purely local install.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Setting up DOS 6 and Windows 3.1</A>
</H2>

<P>On the client computer, boot on your favorite dos floppy disk (either
remove the bootprom or type <CODE>FloppyBoot</CODE> within BpBatch).
Format the dos partition of your hard-drive with the <CODE>/S</CODE> 
option, in order to put the operating system on it.
The size of the partition is not important, as disk archives created
with <CODE>MrZip</CODE> 
Create a <CODE>DOS</CODE> subdirectory, copy DOS in it. Install your
favorite network client (for instance Microsoft LanManager),
Windows 3.1, and so on. If you use Microsoft LanManager,
do not use DHCP for the IP configuration as it is a very poor
implementation that will almost surely fail with reasonable
network load. To do that, add the following lines in your <CODE>protocol.ref</CODE>
file, in the section that loads <CODE>tcptsr</CODE> (of course, replaces the <CODE>xxx</CODE>
by your true IP parameters):
<PRE>
        IPADDRESS0 = xxx xxx xxx xxx
        SUBNETMASK0 = 255 255 xxx xxx
        DEFAULTGATEWAY0 = xxx xxx xxx xxx
        DISABLEDHCP = 1
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Do not be afraid to use EMM386 to optimize the memory usage, and
even to include the area where you put your network adapter ROM,
since it is not used anymore at this time. But carefully exclude
the network adapter RAM, or you will not be able to connect to your
server. Use the <CODE>NOEMS</CODE> parameter.</P>
<P>If you want to ensure that the client machine cannot be used without
a valid login name, download our <CODE>nobreak</CODE>
pseudo-device driver (available at <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/nobreak.zip">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/nobreak.zip</A></CODE>)
and run it at the beginning of your
<CODE>config.sys</CODE>. Then add something like this to your <CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

within <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> interactive mode:
<PRE>
        HideBootprom
        HdBoot
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Building the Disk Image</H3>

<P>On the server, make a share called <CODE>admin</CODE> for instance, on
which you will put some stuff for the system administrator.
If the server is a Unix machine, it is a good opportunity to put
in <CODE>admin</CODE> a softlink to the <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> subdirectory,
so that you can put images in it directly from the client.
Within <CODE>admin</CODE>, create a <CODE>/utils</CODE> subdirectory
and put the following files in it:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>mrbatch.exe</CODE>,
the DOS version of <CODE>BpBatch</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>mrzip.exe</CODE>,
the DOS version of the program for building disk images</LI>
<LI><CODE>bpbatch.hlp</CODE>,
the on-line help file</LI>
</UL>

You might also like to put in the same directory a simple MrZip script 
named <CODE>zipdos.mrz</CODE>
file that contains the commands needed for building a DOS image, like this
one:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
showlog
filter -"lanman.dos/lmuser.ini"
filter -"temp/*"
filter -"*.swp"
fullzip "c:/" "L:/tftpboot/dos.imz"

<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now go back to your client, mount the <CODE>admin</CODE> volume on drive
<CODE>L:</CODE>, go to your <CODE>utils</CODE> directory and type the following command:
<PRE>
        mrzip -b zipdos
</PRE>
</P>
<P>One minute later, you will have a new file in the server
<CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> subdirectory called <CODE>dos.imz</CODE>, which is a
compressed image of your hard disk. Copy the following
batch file to <CODE>/tftpboot/dos.bpb</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>
<P>Your remote-boot DOS configuration is ready ! You can now either
set the BOOTP-option-155 to <CODE>"dos"</CODE>, or type <CODE>include "dos.bpb"</CODE>
from within BpBatch to test it.</P>

<H3>Adapting the configuration for other machines</H3>

<P>If you want to customize some settings according to the machine,
typically the IP settings since Micro$oft DHCP is buggy,
you can setup <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> to change some files before booting.
Firsti go to the <CODE>lanman.dos</CODE> directory and do
<PRE>
        copy *.ini *.ref
</PRE>

Then edit the <CODE>.ref</CODE> files and replace all fixed parameters with
BOOTP variable names as in the following examples:
<PRE>
        computername = ${BOOTP-Host-Name}
        ipaddress0 = ${MS-IPAddress}
        subnetmask0 = ${MS-IPSubnet}
        defaultgateway = ${MS-IPRouter}
</PRE>

Then rebuild the disk image as previously.
Note that for IP parameters, we do not use the BOOTP variables directly
because LanManager needs then as space-separated numbers instead of
dot-separated numbers. Change <CODE>dos.bpb</CODE> to the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
hidelog
setpartitions "bigdos:1024"
setbootpart 1
fullunzip "dos.imz" 1

set MS-IPSubnet="$BOOTP-Subnet-Mask"/.= /
set MS-IPRouter="$BOOTP-Routers"/.= /
patch "{:1}lanman.dos/protocol.ref" "{:1}lanman.dos/protocol.ini"
patch "{:1}lanman.dos/tcpputils.ref" "{:1}lanman.dos/tcputils.ini"
patch "{:1}lanman.dos/lanman.ref" "{:1}lanman.dos/lanman.ini"
hidebootprom
hdboot :1
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you prefer, you can also put the <CODE>.ref</CODE> files in the server
<CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> directory instead of in the disk image.</P>
<P>We like to be able to easily change the computers configuration
without rebuilding the image. To do that, copy your <CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE>
and <CODE>config.sys</CODE> as <CODE>autoexec.ref</CODE> and <CODE>config.ref</CODE> to the
server <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE>
and add the following two lines to the batch file above:
<PRE>
        patch "autoexec.ref" "{:1}autoexec.bat"
        patch "config.ref" "{:1}config.sys"
</PRE>

You can then freely change the files and even customize them
with machine-dependant values obtained from BOOTP.</P>
<P>After making any change to the client machine configuration,
do not forget to rebuild the disk image using <CODE>mrzip</CODE>
if you want to preserve your changes.</P>

<H3>System Maintenance and Upgrades</H3>

<P>If you want later to add new software or change anything else,
proceed as follow:
<UL>
<LI>Remote-boot a client computer to get a fresh install</LI>
<LI>Make your changes</LI>
<LI>Redo the disk image</LI>
<LI>Copy the new image in place of the old one on the server</LI>
</UL>

That means, you can upgrade software on your server-based configuration
as if it were a purely local install.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Setting up Windows 95</A>
</H2>

<P>In previous versions of this document, we used
the Microsoft server-based installation of Windows 95, but it
was really too much pain and not much worth:
<UL>
<LI>It is very, very bogus</LI>
<LI>Many software package do not support it and their install will fail. 
Among them, Microsoft Internet Explorer, OnNet 32, Novell's
Protected-mode client (which is MUCH more secure than Microsoft
Client for Netware).</LI>
<LI>It cannot be used with the Microsoft Network client over TCP/IP,
since Microsoft provides no real-mode driver for TCP/IP
compatibe with Windows 95. That means, it cannot be used
with Samba</LI>
<LI>It makes software upgrades almost impossible since every client
turned on will lock many DLLs on the server, and thus produce
<EM>sharing violations</EM> if you try to upgrade them.</LI>
</UL>

Consequently, we throwed away of this document all the informations
and bug-workaround collected during months (you can still find
them as a HTML document at 
<A HREF="win95old/win95old.html">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/win95old/win95old.html</A>)
and turned to our new disk-based remote-boot concept.
Basically, the configuration for Windows 95 is now almost as easy
the configuration for DOS.</P>

<H3>Setting up a Stand-Alone Client</H3>

<P>Setup a regular Windows 95 client, either starting from scratch
as explained in the configuration of a DOS client, starting from
the DOS client and installing over the network (that is what we did).
You can also start with a preconfigured Windows machine, but you
will probably have less knowledge of what stuff is on the hard disk.</P>
<P>Proceed as described above for a DOS client. It is usually NOT necessary
to use EMM386 with Windows 95.
If you are using Windows 95 OSR2 (alias MSWIN 4.1, alias Windows 95 
service pack 1, alias Windows 95 with Internet Explorer), you should
add the following line in the <CODE>[Options]</CODE> section of
<CODE>MSDOS.SYS</CODE> (yes, it is a text file):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
AUTOSCAN=0
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will let Windows know that you do not want ScanDisk to be runned
automatically at boot time.</P>
<P>If you want to reduce network and server load (which will improve your system
performances) while keeping all softwares on the server, you should
consider installing the excellent Shared LAN Cache, from Measurement
Techniques, Inc (see
<A HREF="http://www.lancache.com">http://www.lancache.com</A>). 
This software runs on each client computer, and caches to the local
hard disk every data obtained from the network. Even MS-Office starts
much faster the second time you run it... You need one license
per client computer, but 
it is not very expensive, and the firm make special prices for universities
and colleges. The best thing to do is to go to their Web site and
download the free evaluation copy.</P>

</P>
<P>A few minutes later, you will have a new file if the server
<CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> subdirectory called <CODE>win95.imz</CODE>, which is a
compressed image of your hard disk. If your compressed image was bigger 
than 87 MB, it has probably been splitted in two or more fragments.
These fragments will automatically loaded one after the other when
needed. Note that an image bigger than 87 MB will usually take
More than one minute to uncompress and may irritate your users.
Our Windows 95 image is only 70 MB big, because most software (except
Office and Explorer) completely reside on the server. Only 45 seconds
are needed to uncompress the image and restore the full disk.</P>

<H3>Adapting the configuration for other Machines</H3>

<P>The big difference between Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 is that the
later includes code for Plug-and-play , ie. automatic detection
of your hardware. This not a bad thing in itself, but the trouble is
that it is often too sensible, and that it sometimes fails.</P>
<P>If you try to start another client with exactly the same boot image,
you will probably get several messages during startup telling that
Windows has detected new hardware: a new sound card, a new hard-disk,
a new network card, and even a new mouse... There can be two reasons
for that:
<UL>
<LI>the devices may not use the same ressources (for instance the mouse
is not connected on the same port, or the sound card is not
connected in the same slot - yes, that is detected)</LI>
<LI>the devices may tell to Windows 95 their personal serial number
(for instance, every Windows 95 differenciate every network
card on the basis of its world-wide unique ethernet address)</LI>
</UL>

The fact that Windows 95 discover that the hardware has changed may not
be a problem if the plug-and-play works as-is, but it become a problem
when the plug-and-play does not work. For instance, Windows 95 
plug-and-play for our Logitech PS2/aux mouse does not work, and result
in no mouse at all. To solve such kind of problems, arrange to have
all computers as similar as possible, or make different images for
different hardware. Later, you will discover that you can simply use
the same image and just have several copies of the registery, that
you can copy after having restoring the disk image but before booting.</P>
<P>The thing you cannot avoid to differ between computers is the network
card. PCI cards usually do not mind, but ISA Plug and Play do.
Bad luck for us, the plug-and-play code for our SMC EtherEZ card
hangs the computer. The only solution is to let Windows 95 believe
that it already know the network card, and that it is not necessary
to trigger plug-and-play. The trick for doing that is to automatically
insert an entry for the network card in Windows 95 registery, before
starting it.
Note that this trick is not any more needed with most PCI cards.</P>
<P>Move the <CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE> to the server as described above for DOS.
Edit it (on the server) and add the following lines:
<PRE>
rem --- Patch Windows registery in order to avoid plug-and-play detection
regedit /L:c:\windows\system.dat /R:c:\windows\user.dat c:\temp\patch.reg
</PRE>

<CODE>regedit</CODE> is a standard Windows 95 program that let you browse
the registery if you start it from within Windows 95, or do simple
operations on the registery if you call it from DOS.
Run <CODE>regedit</CODE> under Windows 95, search for your network card,
usually under
<PRE>
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum\ISAPNP
</PRE>

and export the branch using the <EM>File</EM> menu. This will create a text
file, that you should same as <CODE>patch.ref</CODE> in the server <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE>
diretory. Edit this file and find out where the card ethernet address
is stored (do that on two different machines and compare the files
if you can't find it by yourself). Replace it by a pettern in the
form <CODE>${MACID}</CODE>.
Then add lines to the <CODE>win95.bpb</CODE> script like this:
<PRE>
        set macid = "$BOOTP-Client-ID"
        patch "patch.ref" "{:1}temp/patch.reg"
</PRE>

(do any necessary string manipulation for setting <CODE>MACID</CODE> if it is
not exactly the client Ethernet address).
That's all, your clients should not any more try to autodect the network
card.</P>
<P>Once again, this whole trick is not necessary when using PCI network
adapters.
Incidentally, we can use the same mechanism for automatically 
configuring the hostname, which Windows 95 does not seem to take 
into account when configuring through DHCP. We just add the
following line to our <CODE>patch.ref</CODE> file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VNETSUP]
"ComputerName"="${BOOTP-Host-Name}"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP]
"HostName"="${BOOTP-Host-Name}"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\ComputerName\ComputerName]
"ComputerName"="${BOOTP-Host-Name}"
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Using this small registery trick, your configuration should normally be
portable for all machines with similar configurations. If you cannot avoid
that Windows detect some hardware as new on one machine, try to rebuild
the disk image from this machine. This will include the registery
configuration specific to this machine into the image, and hopefully
supress the problem.</P>

<H3>System Maintenance and Upgrades</H3>

<P>If you want later to upgrade software, install bug fixes and 
security fixes, proceed as follow:
<UL>
<LI>Remote-boot a client computer to get a fresh install</LI>
<LI>Make your changes</LI>
<LI>Redo the disk image</LI>
<LI>Copy the new image in place of the old one on the server</LI>
</UL>

That means, you can upgrade software on your server-based configuration
as if it were a purely local install.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 Setting up Windows NT</A>
</H2>

<P>We do not use Windows NT for remote-boot client computers but we
have tested our system to ensure that it work as well. And it works.</P>
<P>As our utilities currently have no support for NTFS (we neither
have the documentation nor the time to do that, but I would be
happy to help anyone who is interested in doing it), you will have to
install NT on FAT16 (simply do not convert your partitions to NTFS
during the setup).</P>
<P>Copy your <CODE>win95.bpb</CODE> boot script to <CODE>winnt.bpb</CODE>.
Change the <CODE>setpartitions</CODE> line in <CODE>winnt.bpb</CODE> to the following:
<PRE>
        setpartitions "BIGDOS:512 BIGDOS:512"
</PRE>

Then boot Windows 95 using this script, and install
your NT client on drive C. Do not worry about the second partition for now. 
Do not install too much stuff, or you will
get a really large and slow-to-uncompress image.
Remove Windows 95 from the disk disk C, you do not need it
in a Windows NT image (the boot menu is handled by the bootprom,
not by NT boot loader).</P>
<P>Reboot your computer in without overwriting the hard disk, ie. do not
execute the <CODE>winnt</CODE> script but just
<PRE>
        hidebootprom
        hdboot
</PRE>

Your NT station should start-up correctly. Make any 
necessary customization.</P>

<H3>Building the Disk Image</H3>

<P>The trouble with Windows NT is that direct disk access is prohibed
by the kernel. That means, <CODE>MrZip</CODE> will not even be able to read the
boot sectors. The best way to do an image is then to boot Windows 95
and to run <CODE>MrZip</CODE> from a DOS window. To do that, change the
<CODE>winnt.bpb</CODE> script so that the Windows 95 image is not restored
on the first but on the second partition:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
hidelog
setpartitions "BIGDOS:512 BIGDOS:512"
setbootpart 2
fullunzip "win95.imz" 2
hidebootprom
hdboot :2
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(if you have any supplementary patch, change the <CODE>"{:1}"</CODE> to
<CODE>"{:2}"</CODE>). Boot with this script; you should have Windows
95 running, but a new drive <CODE>D:</CODE> should be available, with 
Windows NT inside.</P>
<P>Make your disk image as usual (but on <CODE>D:</CODE>, of course), and
save it as <CODE>winnt.imz</CODE> on the server <CODE>/tftpboot</CODE> directory.
Edit one last time the <CODE>winnt.bpb</CODE> script like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
hidelog
setpartitions "BIGDOS:512 BIGDOS:512"
setbootpart 1
fullunzip "winnt.imz" 1
clean 2
#fullunzip "win95.imz" 2
hidebootprom
hdboot :1
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Your Windows NT remote-boot configuration is ready. Of course, if you do
not like to have two partitions, you can setup a single partition
instead. But when you have to rebuild the image, you will have to setup
the second partition again for booting Windows 95.</P>

<H3>System Maintenance and Upgrades</H3>

<P>If you want later to upgrade software, install bug fixes and 
security fixes, proceed as follow:
<UL>
<LI>Remote-boot a client computer to get a fresh install</LI>
<LI>Make your changes</LI>
<LI>Edit <CODE>winnt.bpb</CODE>: comment the <CODE>clean</CODE> and winnt <CODE>fullunzip</CODE>, 
uncomment win95 <CODE>fullunzip</CODE></LI>
<LI>Redo the disk image</LI>

That's all, folks !</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Troubleshooting (FAQ)</A>
</H2>

<P>This section lists most frequently encountered problems.
<DL>
<DT><B>The image download never ends</B><DD>
<P>You are probably using a standard TFTP server, and it cannot handle more
than 65535 packets of 512 bytes (or even 32767 packets for the Solaris
server). That is, your image must be fragmented in pieces of no more
than 30 MB (or 15 MB for Solaris). See under <EM>CopyArchive</EM> for
instructions on fragmenting an existing image. But you should seriously
thing about using InCom's extended TFTP server, as it is much more
efficient (it uses packets of 1408 bytes instead of 512 bytes).</P>
<DT><B>The archive decompression fails immediately</B><DD>
<P>There are three possibilities. Either the image is really corrupted on the
server (try use MrZip to see if it is the case), or the file transfer
has failed because of TFTP timeout, or because of incompatible protocol.</P>
<P>TFTP timeout occurs when the network
is too heavily loaded (for instance if you try to download a huge image
with more than four clients at a time). In this case, <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>
does not retry indefinitely because it would not help. Shut down
a few computers and retry with no more than four computers (or maybe
even three).
If you often need to download images for a lot of computers, you can
try our special Broadcast TFTP server (see the section dedicated to it).</P>
<P>Incompatible protocol is caused by using a standard TFTP server
(typically the one built-in in your UNIX server) while asking
BpBatch to work with enhanced TFTP. If you use a standard TFTP
server, <B>you should remove the .P extension</B> (see the explanation
in the next question).</P>

<DT><B>The computer hangs instead of downloading/unzipping (1)</B><DD>
<P>If you are using Incom's TFTP server, try to add -s 1408 59 to the command
line. If you are not using an enhanced TFTP server, remove the <CODE>.P</CODE>
extension from BpBatch filename on the server and in <CODE>bootptab</CODE>.</P>
<P>Detailed explanation :
this problem occurs if you did not setup an extended TFTP server but
you used <CODE>bpbatch.P</CODE> as the bootfilename DHCP/BOOTP tag. BpBatch will 
indeed try to connect to an extended TFTP server when the bootfilename 
ends with
a <CODE>.P</CODE> extension. To solve this problem, you can either remove the <CODE>.P</CODE>
extension at the end of the bootfilename (it will tell BpBatch to use standard
TFTP) or install an extended TFTP server.
The only supported extended TFTP server today is the
one provided by Incom. You can find compiled binaries on their web site, or
on our distribution directory. For Incom's TFTP server to properly work with
the extended TFTP feature, you must add <CODE>-s 1408 59</CODE> to the command line.</P>
<DT><B>The computer hangs instead of downloading/unzipping (2)</B><DD>
<P>May be your computer has a bad VESA support. Try giving the <CODE>-v</CODE>
command-line argument or setting the VESA variable to <CODE>"OFF"</CODE>.</P>
<DT><B>VESA scrolling is broken</B><DD>
<P>We use a VESA 1.1 function for scrolling. If your video adapter does not
support VESA 1.1, forget it. If the scrolling works for one page, but
then produces a strange strippled pattern, do not worry. This is a known
bug, I will fix it as soon as I have time for it (VESA scrolling is not
really essential...)</P>
<DT><B>There is a corrupted file in the cache</B><DD>
<P>When a file in the cache is corrupted by an external program,
it is automatically removed from the cache. When a file in the cache
is not fully written (because the computer is turned off during the
file transfer), it is also automatically removed. But if the server
transmits a corrupted file or if the transfer aborts from the server
side, it is possible that this file stays in the cache. You can clean-up
the cache simply by holding both shift down while <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> access
it for the first time. Alternatively, you can evaluate <CODE>clean -1</CODE>
in interactive mode.</P>
<DT><B>The EXIT command does not work in a batch file</B><DD>
<P>This is not a bug. Exit is not a command.
There is no exit or quit command because it does not make any sense
to exit from a boot script without booting. And MrBatch is
really the same program as BpBatch.
What you can do instead is calling HdBoot. This makes sense, and the
DOS version will cleanly exit instead of rebooting.
Note that you can exit from the DOS version at any time by
pressing Ctrl-Break. This will restore all hooked interrupts
before leaving.</P>
<DT><B>The Print command does not print</B><DD>
<P>If you try to print something and immediately enter interactive mode,
you may not see your text. This is because your text was written
on the <EM>runtime</EM> screen and the <CODE>Interact</CODE> command has
switched the display to the <EM>Log</EM> screen. Just put a <CODE>GetKey</CODE>
after the print commands and you will see the text output.</P>
<DT><B>MrZip says <CODE>Malloc failed</CODE></B><DD>
<P>MrZip needs a lot of conventional memory to run. 
If you encounter this problem, first ensure that you have unloaded
the bootprom either using <CODE>HideBootprom</CODE> or using InCom's <CODE>bputil</CODE>.
If you run MrZip from
bare MS-DOS (not within Windows 95 DOS box), you should use EMM386
to load the network drivers high in order to get as much conventional
memory as possible. From a Windows 95 DOS box, there is usually no
problem (as long as you have not left your old 16-bit stuff in
your <CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE> when you installed Windows 95).</P>
<DT><B>MrZip aborts while reading directories</B><DD>
<P>This bug has already been fixed once. Get the latest release of
<CODE>MrZip</CODE>. If the problem persists,
try to build your image with <CODE>Trace</CODE> set to <CODE>"ON"</CODE> (and usually
<CODE>PauseLog</CODE> set to <CODE>"OFF"</CODE>); this will let you discover which
file causes the problem. Send a detailled bug report.</P>
<DT><B>MrZip cannot access some file</B><DD>
<P>MrZip is probably trying to read a locked, open or special file, 
such as Windows swap
file. Such files should usually not be included in
the image and should be filtered out (using the <CODE>filter</CODE> command).
It is also possible that the operating system is playing you a trick. 
If MrZip does not tell you what file causes the problem,
try to build your image with <CODE>Trace</CODE> set to <CODE>"ON"</CODE> (and usually
<CODE>PauseLog</CODE> set to <CODE>"OFF"</CODE>).
You can also try to use direct
disk access (that is, do not refer the source partition as
<CODE>"C:"</CODE> or <CODE>"/"</CODE> but as <CODE>"{:1}"</CODE> or 
whatever partition it is). Using
direct disk access is usually slower because we have less buffers than
the operating system, but it may be sometimes more reliable.</P>
<DT><B>Disk images are always reloaded from the server</B><DD>
<P>Disk images are stored in the special cache area and should not be
reloaded if they have not changed on the server. However, as the cache
area always starts after the last used partition, changing the total
size of partitions will move the location of the cache and thus destroy
its content. Another possible reason for a file disappearing from the
cache is that the previous file has grown more than one-and-an-half
times its initial size. The file would then have been overwritten and
need to be downloaded once again. This should almost never occurs.
A third possible reason is a too small cache area. If the free space
left outside the partitions is less than one-and-an-half times the sum
of all compressed image sizes, only the most recently used images will
be present in the cache and the other will have to be reloaded on demand.</P>
<DT><B>Red Hat Linux 5.1 does not boot properly</B><DD>
<P>This distribution assumes Linux was booted using <CODE>lilo</CODE> and checks
for the <CODE>BOOT_IMAGE</CODE> command line argument (in 
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</CODE>). Simply add it in the <CODE>linuxboot</CODE>
call, or change your <CODE>rc.sysinit</CODE>.</P>
<DT><B>The broadcast TFTP ramdisk hangs (<EM>Got in bound state</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Linux dhcp client is a program that dynamically changes the
IP address of the client according to DHCP offers. If the address
is offered forever (infinite lease time), the DHCP client just 
set the address and returns (this is what we expect). 
However, if the lease time is
limited, the DHCP client must remain loaded and ask for new
addresses every few minutes. And if the
DHCP client does not return, MrBatch will never be loaded...
The solution is to give an infinite lease time (sometimes
encoded as -1).</P>
<DT><B>File access hangs under BpBatch, but not under MrBatch</B><DD>
<P>This problem occured on an AMI BIOS dated 94/07/25. We investigated
a little bit, and found no solution. It seems that this problem is
due to a bug in this BIOS (some register or memory location must
be destroyed).</P>
<DT><B>Unzip of a fragmented archive fails (Malloc failed)</B><DD>
<P>This problem was introduced with PXE compatibility, but has now been
fixed. Please get the latest version.</P>
<DT><B>MrBatch and MrZip complain about the terminal under RedHat 5.x</B><DD>
<P>This problem has been fixed in the 9th of August version of MrBatch/MrZip.
There was a problem with a new version of ncurses which has been released
with RedHat 5.1. </P>
<DT><B>"libncurses.so.3.0: cannot open shared object file" under Linux</B><DD>
<P>MrZip has been linked to the version 3.0 of libncurses. You can use other
versions of libncurses only if they are newer than version 3.0. To use a 
newer libncurses, all you have to do is to create a soft link from 
libncurses.so.3.0 to your libncurses.so.xx file.
With RedHat 5.1, you can use the following command :
<CODE>cd /usr/lib ; ln -s libncurses.4.2 libncurses.3.0</CODE>
You can also download a version recent version of mrzip/mrbatch. Starting
from the 10/25/98, mrbatch is now compiled under RedHat 5.1.</P>
<DT><B>MrBatch and MrZip do not start under Linux (file not found)</B><DD>
<P>This problem is the reverse of the previous one. Now that the distribution
is libc6 ready, it cannot be used any more with libc5. If you encounter
this problem, simply upgrade your Linux box (Well, if we hear too
much complaints, we might try to keep two distributions...).</P>
<DT><B>I can not access other mode than the default 800x600 VESA mode</B><DD>
<P>You should first display the contents of the <CODE>VESA-Modes</CODE> variable, to
see if your hardware support the mode you would like to use.
Then, try one of the two ways to select a special VESA mode :
<UL>
<LI><CODE>InitGraph "mode"</CODE>: Try InitGraph "1024x768", and then run the
graphical primitive you are interested in (e.g <CODE>DrawGif</CODE>).</LI>
<LI><CODE>VESA-Modes</CODE>: The first field of the <CODE>VESA-Modes</CODE> variable is
the name of the default mode. If you change the VESA-Modes variable, all
graphical primitive will use the mode you specified.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<DT><B>BpBatch prints a "Malloc failed" message when restoring multiple fragments images</B><DD>
<P>We corrected a bug in the memory allocation functions of BpBatch. You should make sure that you have a version of BpBatch which has been released after september the 22nd 1998.</P>
<DT><B>Fullunzip using the Linux version of MrBatch always fails</B><DD>
<P>We corrected this problem in the 09/22/1998 release.</P>
<DT><B>Scandisk says my disk is corrupted</B><DD>
<P>The 10/25/98 release did correct a problem with large images. Try to download a recent version of BpBatch.</P>
<DT><B>My RedHat boot floppydisk does not work with FloppyBoot</B><DD>
<P>This bug has been corrected in the 10/25/98 release.</P>
<DT><B>My FAT32 disk image does not boot properly</B><DD>

<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Remote-Boot Tools Reference Manual</A></H2>

<P>This section provides detailled informations on the use of the tools
we developped at the CUI, University of Geneva for this remote-boot
configuration.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 BpBatch, MrBatch and MrZip</A>
</H2>

<P>These three names stand for three variants of the same program,
with the following characteristics:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>BpBatch</CODE> is a special program that can be started from the
BootProm before the operating system is loaded. It is made
of two parts: <CODE>bpbatch.P</CODE>, the dynamic loader, and
<CODE>bpbatch.ovl</CODE>, the program itself. <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> has
full disk I/O capabilities through our own implementation
of FAT16, FAT32 and Ext2fs, as well as remote network I/O
capabilities through the BootProm TFTP API.
<CODE>BpBatch</CODE> was compiled under DOS using 
Borland C 5.0 and Turbo Assembler 3.2.</LI>
<LI><CODE>MrBatch</CODE> is the DOS/Linux version of <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>.
All commands recognized by <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> are recognized by
<CODE>MrBatch</CODE> and vice versa. This is very usefull if you
want to test your batch scripts from a DOS/Linux session.
Under DOS, <CODE>MrBatch</CODE> emulates remote I/O by OS-based file
access if the bootprom is not available. Under Linux,
the bootprom cannot be seen anymore but <CODE>MrBatch</CODE>
can emulate it using Linux IP support, or use OS-based file
access.
<CODE>MrBatch</CODE> was compiled under Linux using GCC 2.7.2.1
and under DOS using Borland C 5.0 and Turbo Assembler 3.2.</LI>
<LI><CODE>MrZip</CODE> is an interpreter that recognizes a superset of
<CODE>MrBatch</CODE> language, and that serves to build disk images.
In <CODE>MrZip</CODE>, the limited remote file I/O is replaced by a 
full-featured OS-based file access. <CODE>MrZip</CODE> does not
include VESA support.
<CODE>MrZip</CODE> was compiled under Linux using GCC 2.7.2.1
and under DOS using Borland C 5.0 and Turbo Assembler 3.2.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Command Line Arguments</H3>

<P>All programs accept the same syntax of arguments. <CODE>MrBatch</CODE> and
<CODE>MrZip</CODE> take them from the command line, while <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>
look for them in the BOOTP option 155 (decimal). Here is the
syntax of the arguments:
<PRE>
        [-x] [-l] [-b] [-v] [-w] [-i] [script-basename]
</PRE>

where:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>-x</CODE> disable the use of extended memory</LI>
<LI><CODE>-l</CODE> disable the use of ISO-latin-8859-1 as default character
set</LI>
<LI><CODE>-b</CODE> cancel the bootprom detection (which cause a floppy
seek under DOS)</LI>
<LI><CODE>-v</CODE> cancel the VESA detection (which cause a switch to full
screen under Windows 95)</LI>
<LI><CODE>-w</CODE> enable direct disk write access (disabled by default
under DOS and Linux)</LI>
<LI><CODE>-i</CODE> enable interactive mode even if a script name is provided</LI>
</UL>

The <CODE>script-basename</CODE> is optional. If provided, <CODE>MrBatch</CODE> and
<CODE>BpBatch</CODE> load the file with the <CODE>.bpb</CODE> extension, and <CODE>MrZip</CODE>
loads the file with the <CODE>.mrz</CODE> extension. If not provided,
<CODE>MrBatch</CODE> and <CODE>MrZip</CODE> run in interactive mode while <CODE>BpBatch</CODE>
loads the file with the same basename as the BOOTP Boot file and
a <CODE>.bpb</CODE> extension.</P>

<H3>Syntax rules</H3>

<P>The following rules apply when <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> parses an input line.
<UL>
<LI>Commands are parsed line by line. Lines are separated by CR and/or LF.</LI>
<LI>The maximal line length is currently 255 characters.</LI>

<LI>" is interpreted as the special string delimiter</LI>
<LI>When ${variable} or $variable is encountred, it is substituted by 
the value
of the variable, or by an empty string if the variable is undefined.
The substitution also occurs within a string. Moreover, the resulting
substituted value must be explicitely enclosed between double quotes
if used as a string value (ie. one should merely speak of macro expansion
than of a variables).</LI>

        "I said: \"Hello world\""
</PRE>

Strings can be postfixed with a few operators.
<UL>
<LI>The character substitution operator:
<PRE>
        "Hello world"/o=u/      ==      "Hellu wurld"
        "198.76.54.32"/.= /     ==      "198 76 54 32"
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>The word selection operator (zero-based):
<PRE>
        "Hello world"{0}        ==      "Hello"
        "198 76 54 32"{1-3}     ==      "76 54 32"
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>The substring selection operator (zero-based):
<PRE>
        "Hello world"[4]        ==      "o"
        "Hello world"[4-7]      ==      "o wo"
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>

Operators can be chained by postfixing one after the other.
For informations about the string length and word count operators,
see under "Numerical expressions".</P>

<DT><B>Numerical expressions</B><DD>
<P>Numerical expressions work on 32-bits integer numbers
(from -2,147,483,646 to 2,147,483,647). Hexadecimal octal and
binary numbers are not understood.
Whenever a numerical expression is expected, the following
are recognized:
<UL>
<LI>A positive or negative integer number</LI>
<LI>An expression in the form (<EM>expr1 op expr2</EM>) 
where <EM>op</EM> can be 
either +, -, * (multiply), / (divide) or <CODE>%</CODE> (modulo)
and <CODE>expr</CODE> is a numerical expression.
Note that EACH operation MUST be enclosed between parenthesis :
<PRE>
        ((3 * 5)+2)             == 17
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>The string-length operator (@), followed by a string :
<PRE>
        @"Hello world"          == 11
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>The word-count operator (#) followed by a string :
<PRE>
        #"Hello world"          == 2
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<DT><B>Durations</B><DD>
<P>A few commands expect durations as arguments. Durations are measured
in seconds, with a precision of up to a tenth of second:
<PRE>
        Delay 3                 waits for 3 seconds
        Delay 0.3               waits for 3/10 seconds
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>Colors</B><DD>
<P>Whenever a color is expected, you can either use the numeric value
of the color or its symbolic name (case-insensitive).
The following colors are recognized
<PRE>
        Black           0
        Blue            1
        Green           2
        Cyan            3
        Red             4
        Magenta         5
        Brown           6
        LightGray       7
        DarkGray        8

        LightMagenta   13
        Yellow         14
        White          15
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>File References</B><DD>
<P>File names are strings. They must therefore always be enclosed between
double-quotes. File names are case-sensitive on case-sensitive
filesystems, case-insensitive on case-insensitive filesystems.
Slash and backslash can be freely used one in place of the other.
Do not forget to double backslash since a single backslash
is an escape character.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of file references:
<UL>
<LI>Direct disk files</LI>
<LI>Foreign files</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Direct disk files are referenced using the following notation:
<PRE>
        "{disk:partition}/absolute/filename"
</PRE>

The disk number can be omitted and defaults to zero.
For instance, <CODE>"{:1}/usr/bin"</CODE> points to <CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> 
assuming there is
such a directory on the first partition. Direct file I/O is
solely based on our own file access routines (we do not use the
operating system).</P>
<P>There are two <EM>special</EM> partitions. Partition zero corresponds to
the hard disk master boot record (MBR) and has a pseudo file-system
which let you access the boot code. Partition minus-one (-1) corresponds
to the cache filesystem (see below).</P>
<P>Under BpBatch/MrBatch, foreign files correspond to remote files on the
TFTP server when the BootProm is available:
<PRE>
        "help.bpb"           is the file help.bpb in the /tftpboot directory
        "gifs/MyImage.gif"   is a file in /tftpboot/gifs
</PRE>

Other TFTP servers can be referenced :
<PRE>
        "198.76.54.32:help.bpb" 
</PRE>

If the other server is behind a gateway :
<PRE>
        "198.70.0.1/198.76.54.31:help.bpb"
</PRE>

One can also specify a specific port for the TFTP connection :
<PRE>
        "198.76.54.32@89:getpasswd/smith"
</PRE>

There can be only one open remote file at a time.
If the BootProm is not available, remote files are emulated using
the operating system file I/O, but the same restriction apply.</P>
<P>Under MrZip, foreign files correspond to files as seen by the operating
system. There is no limitation, and foreign files can be used wherever
direct disk files can be. Foreign files are usually faster than direct
disk files, because the operating system has more buffers. Foreign
files can refer to network files if supported by the operating system.
<PRE>
        "C:\\autoexec.bat"
        "C:/config.sys"
        "/mnt/net/usr"
</PRE>
</P>
</DL>
</P>

<H3>The Cache Filesystem</H3>

<P>In order to reduce network load and to fasten the boot process,
disk archives, linux kernels and possibly other files are cached
on the hard disk. This disk cache is located at the end of the
hard disk, between the last cylinder allocated in the partition
table and the last physical cylinder of the disk (out of any
allocated partition). There MUST be room between the last partition
and the end of the disk if you want the cache filesystem to work.
The cache filesystem MUST work if you want to restore a disk image.</P>
<P>The disk cache is organised in a volatile, CRC-validated filesystem :
Each directory entry and each 32 KB data block is validated by a
32-bits CRC. Whenever a directory entry or a data block unexpectedly
changes, the file is automatically removed from the cache and
downloaded again upon the next request.</P>
<P>You can freely access the cache filesystem from within BpBatch, MrBatch
and MrZip using direct disk access on the special partition 
<CODE>"{:-1}"</CODE>.
To see the content of the cache, just type :
<PRE>
        logdir "{:-1}"
</PRE>

If the cache ever gets corrupted and is not automatically cleaned (which
should never occurs), you can either type : 
<PRE>
        clean -1
</PRE>

(in interactive mode) or hold both shifts down when BpBatch access
the cache for the first time.</P>

<H3>Graphics output commands</H3>

<P>This section lists commands used to perform graphic-mode output.
For the functions listed in this section, coordinates are given
in pixels. You can also use all text output commands (see above)
in graphic mode.
Optional arguments are listed between parenthesis.</P>
<P>Note that the graphic mode is automatically turned on whenever a graphic
command is used, unless the variable <CODE>VESA</CODE> is set to <CODE>"OFF"</CODE>.
<DL>
<DT><B>InitGraph ("mode")</B><DD>
<P>Turn on VESA graphics.
The origin is on the upper-left corner of the screen (0 0).
VESA graphics may hang some computers under Windows 95. Run MrBatch
with the -v option to avoid such problems.</P>
<P>You can request a specific video mode if you use the parameter "mode"
This parameter is optional: if you do not specify any value, the video
mode will be taken from the first field of the VESA-Modes variable.</P>
<P>Valid modes are :
<UL>
<LI>640x480    =>  640 by 480 pixels, 256 colors</LI>
<LI>800x600    =>  800 by 600 pixels, 256 colors (default mode)</LI>

<DL>
<DT><B>GetPasswd (<EM>variable</EM> (<EM>max-length</EM>))</B><DD>
<P>Same as Input, but echo stars instead of the typed characters.</P>

<DT><B>Crypt "text" "salt" <EM>variable</EM></B><DD>
<P>Apply the Unix crypt function to the given 8-chars text and store the
resulting crypted string into <EM>variable</EM>. The "salt" is usually a
two-character string that will be found as the first two characters
of the crypted string.</P>
<P>Note that Unix crypt is a one-way function. It is not possible to
decode the crypted string. One can only try to crypt another string
with the same salt and compre the resulting crypted string.</P>

<P>This section lists commands for preparing the hard-disk.
Optional arguments are listed between parenthesis.
<DL>
<DT><B>GetPartitions <EM>variable</EM> (<EM>disk</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Read the partition table(s) for the given disk and store it as a
string into the given <EM>variable</EM>. The result string is a space-separated
list of <EM>Type:Size</EM>, where
<UL>
<LI>  <EM>Type</EM> is FAT16, EXT, BIGDOS, NTFS, FAT32, FAT32-LBA,
BIGDOS-LBA, EXT-LBA, LINUX-SWAP, LINUX-EXT2
or the decimal filesystem id for unknown types.</LI>
<LI>  <EM>Size</EM> is the size of the partition in megabytes.</LI>
</UL>

See SetPartitions for more informations about partitions.</P>

<DT><B>SetPartitions "partitions" (<EM>disk</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Setup the partition table(s) to the content of the string. The format
used is the same that for GetPartitions. This command also
reset all boot flags (hint: use SetBootPart).</P>
<P>The main partition table in the master boot record (MBR)
has only four entries. Moreover, DOS and Windows accept
only ONE FAT partition (called the Primary partition, C:)
in the main partition table. Any supplemental FAT partition
should be nested in an extended partition (and is thus
called a Logical partition). If we give numbers 1-4 to
the partitions described in the MBR partition table
and numbers 5-8 to the partitions described in the
first extended partition, the definition of two
FAT partitions would work by defining partition 1
as FAT, partition 2 as EXT and partition 5 as
FAT. Partitions 3,4,6,7 and 8 should be marked
as UNUSED. The same scheme can be used recursively
to define more than two FAT partitions: nesting
another extended partition in partition 6 and
adding a logical FAT partition in partition 9.</P>
<P>In the most strict interpretation of DOS specifications,
that means that entries 3 and 4 of the partition tables
are never used. In practice, some versions of DOS and
some other OS are able to use more than two partitions
per partition table, but there is no clear rule.
On this side, BpBatch is rather flexible in its
interpretation of partition tables, it can often
understands things that OSes cannot.</P>
<P>One universal rule is that there should never be more
than one extended partition per partition table, otherwise
the partition numbering scheme breaks down.</P>
<P>If you want to try funny configurations, make your own
experiments, but don't complain if the OS does not
recognize your partitions. The only way it is guarantee
to work is to use the primary partition to store the
OS boot partition, and to nest all other partitions,
one at a time, in extended partitions.</P>
<P>Example of extended partitions :
<PRE>
        SetPartitions "BIGDOS:100 EXT:400 EMPTY EMPTY BIGDOS:400"
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>GetBootPart <EM>variable</EM> (<EM>disk</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Get the partition number with the boot flag turned on (DOS says:
the activated primary partition) and store it to the <EM>variable</EM>.
The first partition is numbered 1.
If no partitions has the boot flag turned on, answers zero.</P>

<DT><B>SetBootPart <EM>partition</EM> (<EM>disk</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Set the boot flag to the given partition. The boot flag let the
master boot record (MBR) choose which partition to boot on.
The first partition is numbered 1.</P>

<DT><B>Blank <EM>partition</EM> (<EM>disk</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Fill the given partitions with zeroes. Can take quite a lot of time
for big partitions. Do not format the partition for any operating
system. See also <CODE>Clean</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>Clean <EM>partitions</EM> (<EM>disk</EM>) ("label")</B><DD>
<P>Fast-format the given partition(s) according to the type declared
in the partition table. If a label is given and the filesystem
supports it, setup the partition label. For a paranoiac full format,
call <CODE>Blank</CODE> on the partition first.</P>
<P>Clean is supported for (FAT16) BIGDOS, FAT32, EXT, LINUX-EXT2 and LINUX-SWAP
partitions. To clean the master boot record (MBR), use <CODE>Clean 0</CODE>.</P>
<P>Clean should be used on data partitions and on MBR/EXT partitions.
It is totally useless to clean a partition before unzipping a filesystem
on it using <CODE>FullUnzip</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>FullUnzip "full-archive" <EM>partition</EM> (<EM>disk</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Decompress a full disk archive to the given partition, overwriting
any existing file (clean-up on the fly).</P>
<P>FullUnzip is supported for (FAT16) BIGDOS, FAT32 and LINUX-EXT2.</P>
<P>This commands turn on VESA graphics to display a progress banner,
unless <CODE>VESA</CODE> has been turned <CODE>OFF</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>IncrUnzip "incr-archive" "destpath"</B><DD>
<P>Decompress an incremental disk archive to the given path. Files
in the archive replace those with the same name on the target path,
but other files are not deleted.</P>
<P>IncrUnzip is supported for (FAT16) BIGDOS, FAT32 and LINUX-EXT2.
This command is far less efficient than FullUnzip since the existing
filesystem structure must be preserved. However, it avoids
multiplying the number of different disk images by storing
the differences only.</P>

<DT><B>FileUnzip "source-filename" "dest-filename"</B><DD>
<P>Uncompress a file previously compressed with <CODE>MrZip</CODE> FileZip command.
The file is validated by a 32-bits CRC.</P>

<DT><B>Copy "source-filename" "dest-filename"</B><DD>
<P>Copy the source file to the destinaton file, byte-to-byte.
Can be used after a FullUnzip for instance to update configuration
files from the server without rebuilding the image.
Better to use <CODE>FileUnzip</CODE> for big and easy-to-compress files.</P>

<DT><B>Append "src-filename-1" "src-filename-2" "dest-filename"</B><DD>
<P>Copy the first, then the second file to the destination file, byte-to-byte.
Can be used on arbitrary large files.
The destination file cannot be one of the two source files.</P>

<DT><B>Patch "source-filename" "dest-filename" ("prefix" ("postfix"))</B><DD>
<P>Read the source file and perform variable substitution before writing
it to the destination file. The interpretation of characters above ASCII
127 depends on the value of $IsoLatin.</P>
<P>By default, variables are recognized when prefixed by "${" and
postfixed by "}". This can be changed to any other non-empty string.
remember that if you want to use a dollar sign within the prefix or
suffix, you must escape it or it will get macro-evaluated. For instance,
if you want to explicitely use the default prefix and postfix, use:
<PRE>
        Patch "source-file" "dest-file" "\${" "}"
</PRE>
</P>

<DT><B>MkDir "path"</B><DD>
<P>Recursively create directories from the root to the given full path.
If the path already exists, this command has no effect.</P>

<DT><B>Delete "filename", Del "filaname"</B><DD>
<P>Remove the given file. The file must exist.</P>

<DT><B>DelTree "path"</B><DD>
<P>Recursively remove all files and directories under the given path,
and remove the directory itself.</P>
</DL>

<H3>Boot commands</H3>

<P>This section lists commands for continuing the boot process.
Optional arguments are listed between parenthesis.
<DL>
<DT><B>HideBootProm</B><DD>
<P>Restore the memory and the interrupt vectors allocated by the bootprom.
All attempts to make TFTP transfers will fail after calling this command.
It is usually a good idea to call this command before HdBoot, or you
might run short of memory under DOS/Windows. This command is
implicitely called by FloppyBoot.</P>
<P>Note that although this function restore all vectors "officially" 
rerouted by the BootProm, it does not seems to restore everything.
But it works well enough for DOS and Windows.</P>

<DT><B>LoadRamDisk "ramdisk-filename"</B><DD>
<P>Load a floppy disk image into the extended memory and redirect
the BIOS Disk Services to make floppy disk calls use this image
instead. This command implicitely calls <CODE>HideBootProm</CODE>. Call
<CODE>FloppyBoot</CODE> to boot on the ramdisk you just loaded.</P>
<P>This kind of ramdisk may not be as robust as what you get when
you use the TFTPBoot command. The only advantage is that it only
steals a few hundred bytes of conventional memory instead of the
&gt;64 KB reserved by the TCP/IP BootPROM. Warning, nothing secures the
extended memory in which the ramdisk resides.
There is no way to uninstall such a ramdisk.</P>

<DT><B>LoadZRamDisk "ramdisk-filename"</B><DD>
<P>Do the same as <CODE>LoadRamDisk</CODE>, but for an image that has been
compressed using <CODE>MrZip</CODE> FileZip command. Compressed ramdisks are
protected against data corruption (and uncomplete download) by a
byte count and a 32-bits CRC.</P>

<DT><B>TFTPBoot "remote-bootfile"</B><DD>
<P>Chain to another boot file (for instance a floppy image made with
InCom's BpShell program). See the file referencing conventions
for accessing a file on another TFTP server.</P>

<DT><B>FloppyBoot</B><DD>
<P>Hide the Boot ROM, load the floppy disk boot sector and boot on it.</P>

<DT><B>HdBoot (<EM>disk</EM>)(:<EM>partition</EM>)</B><DD>
<P>Load the given boot sector and boot from it. The disk default to zero,
the first hard disk, and the partition defaults to zero, ie. the
master boot record. You can boot from any partition, but be warned that
Windows 95 may not let you boot a partition that has not been
set as the boot partition (hint: use SetBootPart).</P>
<P>This command does not implicitely call HideBootProm, so you might
want to call it before.</P>

<DT><B>LinuxBoot "kernelfile" ("command-line" ("ramdisk-file"))</B><DD>
<P>Load the given kernel and ramdisk into the high memory,
setup the command line and boot the kernel. It is a good idea
to put at least a minimal command line with the location of the
root filesystem (like <CODE>"root=</CODE>dev/hda1"/). If you are using a linux
system that heavily relies on <CODE>lilo</CODE> (like RedHat Linux 5.1), 
it may be necessary to add to the command line something like 
<CODE>BOOT_IMAGE=linux</CODE>. Note that the kernel
can be loaded by TFTP (automatically cached on the hard disk)
or directly from the target root partition.</P>
<P>This command works for small and big kernels (<CODE>zImage</CODE> and <CODE>bzImage</CODE>).</P>
</DL>
</P>

<H3>National language support</H3>

<P>This section lists commands related not national language support.
Optional arguments are listed between parenthesis.
<DL>
<DT><B>RemapKeys "original-keys" "remapped-keys"</B><DD>
<P>National keyboard support. Remap given keys to other characters.
For instance, to swap the Y and Z keys, use
<PRE>
        Remapkeys "yzYZ" "zyZY"
</PRE>

It is a good idea to use the quoted octal notation when using characters
not included in the minimal ASCII character set, in order to avoid a
dependency to the iso-latin modal settings.</P>
<P>For international keyboards, there are two keys that produce a backslash
in non-remapped (US) mode. Each of them can be independantly remapped,
thanks to the fact that <CODE>BpBatch</CODE> sees one of them as a key answering
ASCII code 252 (octal) or ASCII code 335 (octal) when shifted.</P>
<P>If you send me a sample script that does keyboard mapping for
your national keyboard, I will make it available under <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/sample-scripts">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/sample-scripts</A></CODE>
To help you make your own keyboard mapping, I suggest pressing all <EM>special</EM>
keys without remapping the keyboard and writing down the character they produce. 
These will be the <CODE>original-keys</CODE>. The <CODE>remapped-keys</CODE> simply are
the key you would have liked to see, in the same order. If some keys (either
original or remapped) produce characters above ASCII dec 127, use the quoted
octal notation. You can easily get the octal code for any given character by
looking in the ASCII table of HelpPC for instance (HelpPC is a shareware
hypertext on-line help program by David Jurgens).</P>

<DT><B>RemapAltkeys "original-keys" "remapped-keys"</B><DD>
<P>National keyboard support. Remap the given keys when ALT is depressed
For instance, to map Alt-2 to the ampersand sign, use
<PRE>
        RemapAltKeys "2" "@"
</PRE>

Note that dead keys are not supported.</P>

<DT><B>LoadCodePage "cpxxx.bin"</B><DD>
<P>Load and activate the given binary Codepage file.
Codepages are used for the translation of Unicode characters
(present on VFAT valumes for instance) into 8-bits characters.
If you do not have the right Codepage loaded, you will get FAT warnings
while accessing the filesystem when special characters are encountred.</P>
<P>All binary codepage files are available at <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/codepage.zip">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/codepage.zip</A></CODE></P>
<P>The default codepage is 850, a reordered superset of ISO-Latin-1.
If you load a more exotic codepage, you should usually turn the variable
<CODE>$IsoLatin</CODE> to <CODE>"off"</CODE> or you might get meaningless
implicit conversions. Moreover, if you want to display exotic characters,
you should also load the proper screen font (use <CODE>"LoadFont"</CODE>).</P>

<DT><B>LoadFont "fontfile"</B><DD>
<P>Load and activate a VGA/VESA font, both in text and graphic mode.
The font file must be a binary file of 16 bztes/characters
(8x16 bitmap). This command can be used for National Language Support
as well as for Fantasy support.</P>
<P>An archive with several fantasy fonts is available at <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/fonts.zip">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/fonts.zip</A></CODE>.
This archive also contains a program to extract fonts for your codepage
from the DOS <CODE>.CPI</CODE> file.</P>

full pathname. By default, all files are included in the image.
You only need to explicitely allow files that where cancelled by a filter.
Each negative filter has its own positive filter (allowed) sublist.</P>
<P>For DOS/Windows images, you will typically use 
<PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 NoBreak.sys</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE>Nobreak.sys</CODE> is a very small (about 350 bytes only) driver that
you include at the beginning of your <CODE>config.sys</CODE>. Its goal is
to secure the boot process, until the user is logged in.
DOS provides a setting for this (namely <CODE>BREAK=OFF</CODE>), but it is not
drastic enough, and has almost no effect in the <CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE>.
Our driver works by modifying the scan-code of the key
pressed when a break is requested, directly at the BIOS level.
This way, no program at all can receive a break until break is
enabled again.</P>
<P>The driver must be loaded from the <CODE>config.sys</CODE> (or using the <CODE>devlod</CODE>
program from <EM>Undocumented DOS</EM>). Afterwards, break can be
enabled by sending <CODE>Yes</CODE> to the <CODE>NOBRK</CODE> pseudo-device,
and disabled again by sending <CODE>No</CODE> (in fact, only the first

<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Special TFTP Servers</A></H2>

<P>As the only network support available in the TCP/IP BootPROM is TFTP, there
is a special interest in enhancing TFTP servers for providing new
capabilities.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Incom Enhanced TFTP Server</A>
</H2>

<P>InCom GmbH distributes with the TCP/IP BootPROM an enhanced TFTP server that
can send packets of up to 1408 bytes instead of the standard 512 bytes.
This is a great enhancement that you should use. This server is available
on the TCP/IP Bootprom Utility disk for Solaris, Windows and as Netware NLM.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Linux Enhanced TFTP Server</A>
</H2>

<P>We built a modified version of Linux TFTP server that acts as InCom 
enhanced TFTP server. Basically, we simply changed the packet size from
512 to 1408 bytes and the port from 69 to 59.
It is available from <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/etftpd.tar.gz">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/etdtpd.tar.gz</A></CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 The Security Gateway</A>
</H2>

<P>We wrote a special TFTP server that serves as security gateway for
authenticating users. This server runs under Linux or Solaris,
and can authenticate users according to a Unix password database
(NIS and shadow passwords are supported), a Windows NT (or Samba)
server or a Radius server. 
It is available from <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/stftpd.tar.gz">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/stdtpd.tar.gz</A></CODE>,
with source and precompiled binaries. 
The precompiled binaries do not
include NT password encryption as we cannot distribute <CODE>libdes</CODE>
but compilation is straightforward.</P>
<P>In order to use the security gateway, you just have to setup a trivial
<EM>security domains</EM> configuration file that describes to which
authentication server each logical security domains maps (the <CODE>Unix</CODE>
domain implicitely maps to the server Unix password database). This is
a sample configuration file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#
# STFTPD configuration file
#  
# This file specify the server of the "security domains". Two types of 
# authentication servers are supported : radius or winnt (winnt includes
# NT Server and Samba)
#
# Format of radius servers 
# radius        &lt;domain>        &lt;serveraddress>         &lt;secret>
#
# secret is the secret word as specified in your /etc/raddb/clients file
#
# Format of SMB servers
# winnt         &lt;domain>        &lt;serveraddress>         &lt;netbiosname>
#
# netbiosname is the NETBIOS name of your server 
#
# Examples
radius         sec-dom-rad     radiusserver    testing123
winnt          sec-dom-nt1     192.168.1.1     NTSERVER1
winnt          sec-dom-smb     samba           SAMBA1
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that if you are using Samba, you must set <CODE>security = user</CODE>.</P>
<P>You can also provide to the security server a file containing a list of 
users which are not allowed to log on (for which the check will fail anyways).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 The Broadcast TFTP Server</A>
</H2>

<P>We wrote a special TFTP server that implements a home-made Broadcast
variant of TFTP. Using this server, we were able to download
images to 25 clients on a heavily loaded 10 Mb ethernet network 
at 6 Mb/s (it is more efficient than the regular TFTP because
it does not need to acknowledge each packets). 
This server runs under Linux or Solaris.
It is available from <CODE>
<A HREF="soft/btftpd.tar.gz">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/soft/btdtpd.tar.gz</A></CODE>,
with source and precompiled binaries. </P>
<P>As the TCP/IP bootprom
does not support this protocol, our solution consist in booting
a tiny ramdisk-based linux system using the tools described in this document,
and running the Linux version of MrBatch which has built-in support
for Broadcast TFTP. A simple batch file can the download all files
to the cache in a few minutes, simultaneously on all client computers.
You do not need to install Linux yourself to use this package, except
if you have exotic hardware and cannot directly use the kernel provided
in the package.</P>
<P>The process works as follow. First, you startup the broadcast server
manually, giving the number of expected client computers as argument
(remember, this procedure is not to be used every day but only when
you changed an image and want to ensure it is immediately uploaded
to all your client computers). Then, you turn on all client computers,
which will run the following BpBatch script:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#
# This batch is run by bpbatch to launch a mini-linux using an initial 
# ramdisk, which will then run mrbatch under linux.
#
# The broadcast TFTP protocol only works with the Linux implementation of
# mrbatch, because of the lack of broadcast support in the bootprom itself.
#
# 1. Setup a tiny partition, to let a lot of space for the cache
setpartitions "BIGDOS:50"
# 2. Clean the MBR
clean 0
# 3. Run a Linux Kernel with initrd (Initial Ramdisk) supprt, and use 
#    bcastrd.gz as the initial ramdisk (will be mounted root and then
#    executed via /linuxrc). See initrd.txt for more details about
#    initial ramdisks. You don't have to specify a root device (second
#    parameter is null) to the kernel, it will use the initial ramdisk.
linuxboot "linux.krn" "" "bcastrd.gz"
# 4. The initial ramdisk will run dhcpcd to setup networking using DHCP.
#    It will then run mrbatch -w bcastlx
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The initial ramdisk contains:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>dhcpcd</CODE>, a DHCP client used to setup networking</LI>
<LI><CODE>mrbatch</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>linuxrc</CODE>, a little wrapper automatically started by initrd and
that starts <CODE>dhcpcd</CODE> then <CODE>mrbatch</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>usr/lib/terminfo/l/linux</CODE>, used by MrBatch</LI>
<LI><CODE>dev/*</CODE>, devices needed to run Linux and mrbatch</LI>
</UL>

All programs are statically linked and stripped, to avoid <CODE>libc.so</CODE>
which is really huge. The resulting ramdisk is Gzipped and takes
less than 300 KB. The kernel itself takes 450 KB (with many network
cards and initrd support).
When Linux is up and running, MrBatch is called with the following script
(that you should edit for your needs):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# This file is executed when mrbatch is launched by the initial ramdisk
# bcastrd.gz
# It's main purpose is to "broacast copy" files to the cache
#
# 1. Be verbose
showlog
# 2. Don't want a "press a key"
set pauselog="OFF"
# 3. Set partitions at their final values. 
#    Important: Since you will copy files into the cache to be used in future
#    boot, you need to specify the same partitions as in the future boots.
setpartitions "BIGDOS:1024"
# 4. Clean the CACHE partition
clean -1
# 5. And the copy files into the cache, using the Broadcast TFTP protocol
#    (port 99)
#
# You can use the script "as is", but you surely need to modify the following
# line ! In our example, we download the file mblinux.imz, which is the image
# file for our installation of Linux.
copy "$BOOTP-Server-IP@99:mblinux.imz" "{:-1}mblinux.imz"
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

When the transfer is done, you can simply turn off all client computers
and change their initial boot script to your favorite menu.</P>
