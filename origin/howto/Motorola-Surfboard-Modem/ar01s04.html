Q: I get kicked offline about once every 4 days, for no apparent reason, and get the following error, or something similar, in the kernel log: 
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
Feb 20 10:05:12 K7 kernel: CDCEther.c: rx status -110
Feb 20 10:05:12 K7 kernel: CDCEther.c: no repsonse in BULK IN

</pre><p>

A: There are a number of reasons this may be happening, and future updates to the CDCEther driver may solve some of them. A user on the Linux-USB-user mailing list noticed that on at least one occasion data sent to the modem from upstream by the cable provider has triggered it. Also, the modem itself is very sensitive to power interruptions and can lose the connection if this occurs. The fix is to run <span class="command"><strong> ifdown ethX</strong></span>, where <span class="emphasis"><em>ethX</em></span> is the ethernet interface (eth0, eth1 etc.) to clear out any remaining settings that are hung, then remove the module with <span class="command"><strong> rmmod CDCEther</strong></span>, reinsert the CDCEther module and then <span class="command"><strong>ifup ethX </strong></span>. A reboot may be necessary if this doesn't fix the problem. If none of these work you probably have a real service interruption.

Q: I get the following messages on boot-up; are they errors?
</p><p>

Can't use SetEthernetMulticastFilters request

Mar  2 11:00:52 K7 kernel: CDCEther.c: Imperfect filtering support -

</pre><p>
</p><p>
A: No. The multicast message is pertaining to Multicast support in the kernel, which is optional and not necessary for the proper functioning of this modem. The message about 'Ethernet Information' is a design bug in the modem and can be ignored. As for the 'Imperfect filtering support,' to quote Brad Hards:
</p><p>
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
This is a bit difficult to explain - I assume that you know what multicasting is - when you join a multicast group, this can be handled by the networking device so that other multicast traffic doesn't cause interrupts. That is called 'perfect filtering.' However sometimes the number of multicast addresses exceeds the number of filters that you have. This leads to 'imperfect filtering,' which can cut down the number of interrupts, but you still need to do some work in the networking stack.  Then you get to the typical cable modem implementation, 
and there is not filtering at all. Every multicast packet goes to the host to be filtered. This doesn't normally matter though, because the cable modem is a point to point link.
</span>&#8221;</span>
</p><p>
Q:  I'm still having problems, or I'm unusually curious...is there a way that I can get more information about what the device is up to?
</p><p>
A:  Yes, there is. The manufacturer hard-wired an http server for status and configuration purposes into the modem itself. It seems to have been designed for troubleshooting by cable tecnician staff, but you can access the 4100 and 4200 models by directing your web browser to <a class="ulink" href="http://192.168.100.1" target="_top">http://192.168.100.1.</a> You will need to kill your firewall if you have one running prior to doing this. You can see statistics, logs and some other miscellaneous info at this address.
