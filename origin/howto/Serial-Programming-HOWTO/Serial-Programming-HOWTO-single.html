><P
>    This is the Linux Serial Programming HOWTO.  All about how to program
    communications with other devices / computers over a serial line under
    Linux. Different techniques are explained: Canonical I/O (only
    complete lines are transmitted/received), asyncronous I/O, and waiting
    for input from multiple sources.
  </P
><P
>    This is the first update to the initial release of the Linux Serial
    Programming HOWTO. The primary purpose of this update is to change the
    author information and convert the document to DocBook format. In terms
    of technical content, very little if anything has changed at this time.
    Sweeping changes to the technical content aren't going to happen 
    overnight, but I'll work on it as much as time allows.
  </P
><P
>    If you've been waiting in the wings for someone to take over this HOWTO,
    you've gotten your wish. Please send me any and all feedback you have,
    it'd be very much appreciated.
  </P
><P
>    All examples were tested using a i386 Linux Kernel 2.0.29.

>2.1. Debugging</A
></H3
><P
>      The best way to debug your code is to set up another Linux box, and
      connect the two computers via a null-modem cable. Use miniterm
      (available from the LDP programmers guide
      (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/programmers-guide/lpg-0.4.tar.gz</TT
>
      in the examples directory) to transmit characters to your Linux
      box. Miniterm can be compiled very easily and will transmit all
      keyboard input raw over the serial port. Only the define statement
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define MODEMDEVICE "/dev/ttyS0"</TT
> has to be checked. Set it to
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ttyS0</TT
> for COM1, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ttyS1</TT
> for COM2, etc.. It is
      essential for testing, that <EM
>all</EM
> characters are transmitted raw
      (without output processing) over the line. To test your connection,
      start miniterm on both computers and just type away. The characters
      input on one computer should appear on the other computer and vice
      versa. The input will not be echoed to the attached screen.
    </P
><P
>      To make a null-modem cable you have to cross the TxD (transmit) and
      RxD (receive) lines. For a description of a cable see sect. 7 of the
      Serial-HOWTO. 
    </P
><P
>      It is also possible to perform this testing with only one computer, if
      you have two unused serial ports. You can then run two miniterms off
      two virtual consoles. If you free a serial port by disconnecting the
      mouse, remember to redirect <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/mouse</TT
> if it exists. If you
      use a multiport serial card, be sure to configure it correctly. I had
      mine configured wrong and everything worked fine as long as I was
      testing only on my computer. When I connected to another computer, the port
      started loosing characters. Executing two programs on one computer
      just isn't fully asynchronous.

      device back to it, which normally has to be changed for data
      transmission.

      a TCP/IP socket and input over a serial connection from another computer
      quasi-simultaneously. The program example given below will wait for
      input from two different input sources. If input from one source
      becomes available, it will be processed, and the program will then
      wait for new input.

>      In non-canonical input processing mode, input is not assembled into
      lines and input processing (erase, kill, delete, etc.) does not
      occur. Two parameters control the behavior of this mode:
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>c_cc[VTIME]</TT
> sets the character timer, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>c_cc[VMIN]</TT
>
      sets the minimum number of characters to receive before satisfying the
      read.
    </P
><P
>      If MIN &#62; 0 and TIME = 0, MIN sets the number of characters to receive
      before the read is satisfied. As TIME is zero, the timer is not used.
    </P
><P
>      If MIN = 0 and TIME &#62; 0, TIME serves as a timeout value. The read
      will be satisfied if a single character is read, or TIME is exceeded (t =
      TIME *0.1 s). If TIME is exceeded, no character will be returned.
    </P
><P
>      If MIN &#62; 0 and TIME &#62; 0, TIME serves as an inter-character
      timer. The read will be satisfied if MIN characters are received, or
      the time between two characters exceeds TIME. The timer is restarted
      every time a character is received and only becomes active after the
      first character has been received.
    </P
><P
>      If MIN = 0 and TIME = 0, read will be satisfied immediately. The
      number of characters currently available, or the number of characters
      requested will be returned. According to Antonino (see contributions),
      you could issue a <TT
