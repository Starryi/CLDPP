<LI> <B>Part 1... The easy bit : </B>
Use minicom or your favourite terminal program to dial the NT RAS 
Server. Once you have a connection you
can proceed to Part 2. Make sure you can quit your terminal without resetting the modem.


</LI>
<LI> <B>Part 2... The harder bit : </B>
Setting up the /etc/ppp/options file may be a bit tricky. The important things to do are...
Make sure you do not have any of the following entries:
<UL>
<LI>auth #This will demand that the NT machine authenticate it's self to your machine, this is generally not
possible, or needed


</LI>
<LI>+pap #This will demand that the NT machine authenticates it's self using PAP, see above


</LI>
<LI>-pap #This says that you won't agree to use PAP


</LI>
<LI>+chap #This will demand that the NT machine authenticates it's self using CHAP, see above

</LI>
</UL>

Make sure the RAS server will accept plain text passwords. You need this to use PAP authentication. This can be
set by going to Control Panel -> Network -> Services -> Remote Access Service -> Properties. Select the
modem or dial up device, go to Network -> Server Settings -> Encryption Settings and select "allow any
authentication including plain text". Then hit OK, Save etc. to close it all.


</LI>
<LI> <B>Part 3... The hardest bit (without this document) : </B>
NOTE: If you use my pppd patch, you will not have to do this

In the /etc/ppp/pap-secretes file, add the following lines:

<HR>
<PRE>
"" * ""
"jn" * "MyPassword"
</PRE>
<HR>


Where jn is your user name on the NT machine. But what if you are a member of a
domain? Then use this instead (where csse-mm is replaced with your domain name)
<HR>
<PRE>
"" * ""
"csse-mm\\jn" * "MyPassword"
</PRE>
<HR>


Note that you must escape the "\" character as "\\". then, back 
to the /etc/ppp/options file and add the following line:

<HR>
<PRE>
name "jn"
or
name "csse-mm\\jn"
</PRE>
<HR>


depending what you put in the pap-secretes file.


</LI>
<LI> <B>Part 4... Another easy bit : </B>
Dial in to the server, like in step one, or using your 
custom script. Start ppp with the following line:

pppd 115200 /dev/cua1

or whatever your settings might be.

You may want to enable debug information if something does not 
work, but everything should.

Run "ifconfig" and you should see an entry for ppp0. If you do then you 
are cooking with gas. Restart pppd
using the "defaultroute" option and start surfing the internet.

If you are still having trouble, or can't understand any of 
these instructions, drop me an e-mail
