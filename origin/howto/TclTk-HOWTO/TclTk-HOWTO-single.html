<H1>The Linux Tcl and Tk HOWTO</H1>

<HR>
<EM>This document describes the Linux approach to Tcl, a scripting langua
ge.
 It is an easy to learn interpreted language that uses a typeless approach to
 achieve a higher level of programming and a rapid application development.
 The Tk toolkit is a programming environment for creating graphical user interf
aces
 (GUI) under X Window System. Their capabilities include the possibility to
 extend and embed in other application, rapid development and ease of use. Toge
ther,
 Tcl and Tk provide many benefits both to application developer and user. Tk-ba
sed
 interfaces tend to be much more customizable and dynamic than those built with
 one of the C or C++ based toolkits. Tk implements the Motif look and feel.
 A great number of interesting X applications are implemented entirely in Tk,
 with no new application-specific commands at all.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="introduction"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>


<P>This is the Linux Tcl and Tk HOWTO. It is intended as a Linux reference
covering everything you should know concerning installation, configuration
and an introduction to development under Tcl and Tk. History and some pros
and cons about Tcl and Tk under Linux are analized, and references are given
to many other sources of information on a variety of topics related to this
simple but powerful scripting language.</P>
<P>If you ever rebuilt your Linux kernel inside X using the command
<HR>
<PRE>
make xconfig
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>you surely managed to face the strenght of this simple but powerful scripting
language.</P>
<P>After executing the first step of kernel rebuilding, a script called kconfig.tk
is executed via wish (the Tcl intepreter). The Linux Kernel Configuration wind
ow
appears. Instead of answering a series of questions, this X-based configuratio
n
utility allows you to use checkboxes to select which kernel options you want
to enable.</P>
<P>The system stores your last configuration options so that every time you
run it, you need only to add or remove some checks and you don't need to reent
er
the whole set of option. Moreover you can fill the whole (or part of the) list
of kernel option the order you want. After this simplified step you can rebuil
d
your kernel in the traditional way.</P>
<P>There's actually another famous case. Have you ever used "printtool"
? (Printer Config Tool (C) Copyright 1994 by
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat Software</A> - author: Michael
Callahan).
If you installed a Red Hat distribution you happily managed to
use it to set up printing services . Well, printtool front-end is mainly a
Tcl/Tk script.</P>
<P>For those who don't know Red Hat let me tell you how you can easily configure
your printers just filling some textboxes and filling in some checkboxes.</P>
<P>The program itself takes care of setting up printing services through the
creation of spooling directory, writes /etc/printcap file and the printer's
filter, reloads lpd and tests your filter with ascii or postscript pages. It
allows you manipulate ghostscript options (i.e. choose up to 8 pages per outpu
t
page and setting margins), has an help-on-line and many more features.</P>
<P>What is the difference compared to other service-printing implementation?</P>
<P>Everything is achieved by using Tcl/Tk as a "glue" between consolidated
application and operating with normal Linux configuration files in a visual
and interactive window under X-Window. No new application-specific commands
were written at all.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Purpose of this document</A>
</H2>


<P>Currently the purpose of the document is limited to giving initial references
to Linux users; in future versions I will try to incorporate a small "Programm
ing
Tutorial".
Let me state that again: this is not (and doesn't want to substitute)
an omnicomprehensive "user manual" or "reference" for Tcl and Tk development
and programming - it's just a starting point for Linux users.</P>
<P>The author's concept of reference manual coincides with the definition
of man pages and many people learn Tcl/Tk from these basic source of informati
on.
These files are a part of the source code distribution and are installed on
your Linux box. You will be able to access the Tcl/Tk manual pages through
the man command.</P>
<P>Many structured and complete programming tutorials have been written in
order to let the new user begin hacking with Tcl/Tk; tons of other material
are available in the Internet. Interpreting Tcl/Tk philosophy I won't try to
reinvent the wheel, I will manage to glue the huge amount of material already
available.</P>
<P>I suggest you to have a look at the other documents listed in the
<A HREF="#references">References section</A> in order to find where to retri
eve
specific information about Tcl and Tk.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What you should know before reading</A>
</H2>


<P>In order to understand the abc of Tcl/Tk you shouldn't be a programming-guru,
command sintax is very simple. Basically you have to be familiar with:

<LI>simple programming concepts;</LI>
<LI>using very common unix commands and/or utilities;</LI>
<LI>having access to the Internet;</LI>
<LI>using ftp.</LI>

"Oh'-stir-howt") while teaching at University of California, Berkeley, Califor
nia.
He actually started implementing it when he got back to Berkeley in the spring
of 1988; by summer of that year it was in use in some internal applications,
but there was no Tk. Read about the history of Tcl/Tk directly from its author

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. What is Tcl/Tk</A></H2>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What is Tcl?</A>
</H2>


<P>Tcl is the acronym for "Tool Command Language" (it is pronounced "tickle").
Tcl is actually divided into two things: a language and a library.</P>
<P>Tcl is a simple textual programming language, intended for issuing commands
to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers and shells. It has
a simple syntax and it is also programmable.</P>
<P>Tcl users can write command procedures to provide more powerful commands
than those given in the built-in set.</P>
<P>Second, Tcl is a library package embeddable in applications. The Tcl library
consists of a parser for the Tcl language, routines to implement the Tcl built
-in
commands, and procedures which allow each application to extend Tcl with addit
ional
commands specific to that application. The application program generates Tcl
commands and passes them to the Tcl parser for execution.</P>
<P>Commands may be generated by reading characters from an input source, or
by associating command strings with elements of the application's user interfa
ce,
such as menu entries, buttons, and other widgets. When the Tcl library receive
s
commands it parses them into component fields and executes built-in commands
directly.</P>
<P>For commands implemented by the application, Tcl calls back to the application
to execute the commands. In many cases commands will make recursive invocation
s
of the Tcl interpreter by passing in additional strings to execute (in fact
procedures and conditional-looping commands all work in this way). An applicat
ion
program can obtain many advantages by using Tcl for its command language:
<UL>
<LI>Tcl provides a standard syntax: once users know Tcl, they will be able
to issue commands easily to any Tcl-based application.</LI>
<LI>Tcl succeeds to provides programmability. All a Tcl application needs to
do is to implement a few application-specific low-level commands. Tcl provides
many utility commands and a general programming interface for building up comp
lex
command procedures. By using Tcl, applications need not reimplement these feat
ures.
</LI>
<LI>Extensions to Tcl, such as the Tk toolkit, provide mechanisms for communi
cating
between applications by sending Tcl commands back and forth. The common Tcl
language framework makes it easier for applications to communicate with one
another.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>It is important to note that Tcl was designed thinking that the programmer
should actually use two or more languages when designing large software system
s.
One for manipulating complex internal data structures, or where performance
is important, and another, such as Tcl, for writing very small scripts that
glue together the other pieces, providing hooks for the user to extend.</P>
<P>For the Tcl script writer, ease of learning, ease of programming and ease
of gluing are more important than performance or facilities for complex data
structures and algorithms.</P>
<P>Tcl was designed to make it easy to drop into a lower language when you
come across tasks that make more sense at a lower level. In this way, the basi
c
core functionality can remain small and one need only bring along pieces that
one particular wants or needs.</P>
<P>One answer to "What is Tcl?" can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.NeoSoft.com/tcl/whatistcl.html ">www.NeoSoft.com/tcl /whatistcl.html</A>
.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 What is Tk?</A>
</H2>


<P>Tk (pronounced "tee-kay") is an extension to Tcl which provides the programmer
with an interface to the X11 windowing system . Note that Tk has been successf
ully
compiled under X11 R4, X11 R5, X11 R6, as well as Sun's NeWS/X11 environments.</P>

<P>Many users will encounter Tcl/Tk via the "wish" command. Wish is a simple
windowing shell which permits the user to write Tcl/Tk applications in a proto
typing
environment.</P>
<P>At present Tcl/Tk cannot handle Japanese, Chinese, Korean, .... language
fonts.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Extensions</A>
</H2>


<P>Since Tcl is so easy to extend, many try to share extensions, including
the popular itcl, 
<A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com/itcl/">[incr Tcl]</A>,
ObjectTcl, TclX, 
<A HREF="http://tix.mne.com/">Tix </A>, and
<A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com/blt/">BLT</A>.</P>
<P>These extensions, of course, require an extended Tcl interpreter. Moreover,
many Tcl free applications require a particular Tcl extension to run.</P>
<P>One of the most popular extension is called
<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov">Expect</A>.
It allows you to place a
friendly front-end inside most command-line based UNIX applications, such as
ftp, telnet, rlogin, passwd, fsck, and so on.</P>
<P>A complete list of Tcl/Tk extensions can be found at URL
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/resource/software/extensions/">www.scr iptics.com/resource/software/extensions/</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Supported Platforms</A>
</H2>


<P>This section contains information about Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0, the most recent
version of Tcl/Tk. They were originally released on August 18, 1997 and the
most recent patch releases (8.0.3) were made on September 3, 1998.</P>
<P>When you download Tcl and Tk you get two programs, wish and tclsh, supporting
script libraries, and on-line reference documentation. These programs are gene
ral
purpose platforms for writing applications with Tcl. Wish includes the graphic
al
user interface toolkit Tk. The packages are ready to use after installation.</P>

<P>Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0 run on most releases of the following operating systems:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows 95</LI>
<LI>Windows NT</LI>
<LI>Solaris and SunOS</LI>
<LI>Linux</LI>
<LI>HP-UX</LI>
<LI>SGI</LI>
<LI>IRIX</LI>
<LI>Digital Unix</LI>
<LI>AIX</LI>
<LI>SCO Unix</LI>
<LI>Most other Unix-like operating systems Macintosh (68K and Power Mac)</LI>
<LI>Pre-compiled releases are available for different Linux distribution.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Installing and getting started with Tcl and Tk</A></H2>


<P>Most modern distribution include Tcl and Tk. Rpm and deb packages with
precompiled binaries are avalaible for Red Hat, SuSE and Debian distributions
(that'll make installation easier).</P>
<P>A modern distribution standard installation will include Tcl/Tk as it is
needed by many configuration tools running mainly under X.</P>
<P>Tcl and Tk are distributed freely in source form via the Internet. There
are no restrictions on their use and no licenses or royalties are needed (see
the 
<A HREF="#license">license.terms</A> section for complete information).</P>

<P>Many more Tcl/Tk scripts and extensions are also available freely.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Downloading the Core Distributions</A>
</H2>


<P>The Tcl/Tk core consists of the Tcl and Tk libraries, plus the wish and
tclsh applications, associated documentation, script libraries, and demonstrat
ive
applications. The primary FTP site for this information is
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/">ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/</A>.</P>

<P>The primary HTTP site is

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Installation</A>
</H2>


<P>Unless already available for your Distribution in proprietary packages
you'll want to download the source release. You'll need both Tcl and Tk source
s.
This procedure refers to the second case.</P>
<P>Choose between compressed tar and gzipped tar format.</P>
<P>Compressed Tar Files</P>
<P>Tcl sources (tcl8.0.3.tar.Z): compressed tar file (about 2.4 Mbytes). Tk
sources (tk8.0.3.tar.Z): compressed tar file (about 3.3 Mbytes).</P>
<P>Gzipped Tar Files</P>
<P>Tcl sources (tcl8.0.3.tar.gz): gzipped tar file (about 1.5 Mbytes). Tk
sources (tk8.0.3.tar.gz): gzip'ed tar file (about 2.1 Mbytes).</P>
<P>When you retrieve one of these files, you will get a compressed tar file
with a name like tcl8.0.3.tar.gz or tcl8.0.3.tar.Z. The files are identical
except for the technique used to compress them (.gz files are generally smalle
r
than .Z files).</P>
<P>To unpack the distribution, invoke shell commands like the following, depending
on which version of the release you retrieved:
<HR>
<PRE>
gunzip -c tcl8.0.3.tar.gz
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>or
<HR>
<PRE>
tar xf - zcat tcl8.0.3.tar.Z
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>or
<HR>
<PRE>
tar xf - unzip tcl80.3.zip
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Each of these commands will create a directory named tcl8.0.3, which includes
the sources for all platforms, documentation, and the script library for Tcl
8.0. To compile and install the distribution, follow the instructions in the
README file in the distribution directory. Be sure to compile Tcl before Tk,
since Tk depends on information in Tcl.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 The Contributed Archive</A>
</H2>


<P>There are many other freely available packages for Tcl and Tk, including
both scripts written in Tcl and extensions written in C or C++. These packages
include database applications and network access, a graphical user interface
builder, the expect program, additional Tk widgets, and dozens of other things
.
The primary site for the Tcl/Tk archive is
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl">ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Mirror Sites</A>

<P>Several other sites around the world mirror the whole or part of the material
from the core site and the contributed archive; you may find more useful to
retrieve information from a mirror site that is close to you.</P>

<P>At the time of this writing, recommended releases are the latest (Tcl 8.0.3
and Tk 8.0.3), which were released in September, 1998. Tcl 8.0 contains a new
bytecode compiler that can speed up execution by a factor of 2-10x. It also
provides namespaces, binary I/O, and several other new features.</P>
<P>Tk 8.0 is the first release to provide native look and feel on Macintoshes
and PCs. Tk 8.0 also supports application embedding and has a new portable
font mechanism. Both Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0 provide additional features in the
Safe-Tcl security model.</P>

free to just point folk at your own ftp site or WWW site if you have one which
can be used .</P>
<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Just a little bit of Programming</A></H2>


<P>Since Tcl is an interpreted language, to run a Tcl program (also called
a script), you normally pass the script file to the Tcl interpreter, wish,
for example:
<HR>
<PRE>
wish hello.tcl
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>You can also use wish in interactive mode and type in commands at the command
line.</P>
<P>There's another standard Tcl interpreter, tclsh, which only understands
the Tcl language. Tclsh does not have any of the Tk user interface commands,
so you cannot create graphical programs in tclsh.</P>
<P>Some Tcl freeware applications extend the Tcl language by adding new commands
written as C functions. If such is the case, you need to compile the applicati
on
instead of just passing its Tcl code to the wish interpreter. This application
program, from a Tcl perspective, is really a new version of the wish interpret
er,
which the new C commands linked in. Of course, the application program may
be a lot more than merely a Tcl interpreter. (Note: you can also use Tcl's
auto-loading capability on systems that support it.)</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 The one-minute program in Tcl</A>
</H2>


<P>Tcl has a simple structure. Each line starts out with a command, such as
button and a number of arguments. Each command is implemented as if it was
a C function. This function is responsible for handling all the arguments.</P>

<P>As a very standard example, the following is the Hello World program in
Tcl/Tk:
<HR>
<PRE>
# This is a comment
button .b -text "Hello World" -command exit
pack .b
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>In this case you have to type the commands interactively to tclsh or wish.</P>
<P>You can also place command into script files and invoke these just like
shell scripts. To do this for the previous example, rewrite the Hello World
program as follows:
<HR>
<PRE>
#! /usr/local/bin wish -f
button .b -text "Hello World" -command exit
pack .b
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Put the text inside a file called Hello and make sure that wish is installed
in /usr/local/bin (otherwise you will have to change opportunely the path).</P>
<P>Make the file Hello executable issuing the command
<HR>
<PRE>
chmod 775 Hello
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>and run it inside X.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Scripting Language: pros and cons</A></H2>


<P>To understand the importance and the future of Tcl/Tk I strongly suggest
to point your web browser at the URL
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/people/john.ousterhout/">www.scriptics .com/people/john.ousterhout/</A>
by 
<A HREF="mailto:ouster@scriptics.com">John K. Ousterhout </A>. You
will read about the importance and the comparison between scripting (in langua
ges
such as Tcl) and system programming (in languages such as C and Java).</P>
<P>To read a document about comparisons see
<A HREF="#prosandcons">the comparison discussion</A>.</P>
<P>Here's a summary of the most important pros and cons about Tcl/Tk.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Some of the most common complaints about Tcl</A>
</H2>


<H3>Tcl is interpreted</H3>


<P>The data is primarily treated as strings, programs written in Tcl are slow.
Tcl 8.x attempts to address this by doing some degree of compilation as well
as permitting additional variable types.</P>
<H3>Several characteristics are not intuitive</H3>


<P>Comments are commands rather than traditional comments, numbers beginning
with 0 are octal, proper use of quoting mechanisms, etc. These aspects are
covered in the various FAQs.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Some of the most pros about Tcl</A>
</H2>


<H3>It is a high-level scripting language</H3>


<P>You need to write a lot less code to get your job done, especially when
compared to Motif or Win32 applications. In general, the number of Line Of
Code (LOC) of a software project is one of the most important complexity index
es.</P>

<H3>Tcl is free</H3>


<P>You can get the sources for free over the Internet from Scriptics Download
Page or from the FTP site for Tcl.
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/software/download.html">The software c ore site</A>
includes the source code version, as well as binary versions for Windows and
Macintosh platforms; or, you can get Tcl on a number of CD-ROMs for a nominal
cost.</P>
<P>Read about Tcl and Tk core free at
<A HREF="www.scriptics.com/about/news/qa.html">www.scriptics.com/about/n ews/qa.html</A> .</P>
<H3>It runs on many platforms</H3>


<P>Versions exist for UNIX (Linux... of course), Windows and Macintosh. Except
for a few platform differences, your Tcl scripts will run the same way on all
systems.</P>
<H3>It is interpreted</H3>


<P>You can execute your code directly, without compiling and linking (though
Tcl compilers are available).</P>
<H3>It is extensible</H3>


<P>It's easy to add your own commands to extend the Tcl language. You can
write your commands in C or Tcl.</P>
<H3>It is embeddable in your applications</H3>


<P>The Tcl interpreter is merely a set of C functions that you can call from
your code. This means you can use Tcl as an application language, much like
a macro language for a spreadsheet application.</P>
<H3>Tcl/Tk is Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant</H3>


<P>Read what the creator of the Tcl and Tk core tells about this topic
