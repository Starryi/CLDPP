NAME="XFREE86"
>2.1. What is XFree86</A
></H3
><P
>XFree86 is an Open Source implementation of the X Windows System (X).  It provides a client-server interface between mouse, keyboard, video display, and a windowed desktop environment.  Because X is network transparent, client programs can be run on a different host machine than the one on which an X Server resides.  </P
><P
>The XFree86 bundle includes a large array of programs including a terminal emulator, clocks, and a mail interface.  This document will focus exclusively on the portions of XFree86  required for maintaining an X Session between an X Terminal and a Linux host.  These are the X Display Manager, xdm, an access control programs and the X Font Server, xfs.</P

>2.2. What is an X Terminal?</A
></H3
><P
>X Terminals are diskless networked microcomputers.  These systems will generally consist of mouse, monitor, keyboard, RAM, battery-powered NVRAM, and secondary ports for connecting peripheral devices such as printer, bar code scanner, etc.  Because they are diskless, X Terminals load their operating system, configuration information, and fonts into memory from a host machine running nfs or tftp, and xfs.  </P
><P
>The Operating System of an X Terminal will provide basic administrative interface for configuration parameters such as tcp, xdmcp, font path, boot path, and other host-related configurations.  It's primary function, however, is to act as an X Server  which exchanges mouse, keyboard, and other display information with client applications loaded on a remote host.  </P

><HR><H3
CLASS="SECT2"
><A
NAME="INFRASTRUCTURE"
>2.3. Infrastructure Overview</A
></H3
><P
>The canonical way of deploying X Terminal systems on an IP-based network is to use the Bootstrap protocol, bootp, to provide client and host ip addresses and to request a bootable image to mount the operating system.  Clients may also store this information from their own NVRAM which mitigates the need for fetching it off of a network.  NFS or TFTP is utilized to load the os image and system fonts into RAM on the client machine.  XDM provides ip-based authentication and management of the display session using XDMCP. XFS may optionally be run on the host to provide anti-aliasing fonts to the client system (highly recommended).  TCP is commonly the transport layer for all client-server interaction.  </P

>3. Host Environment</A
></H2
><P
>In an X environment, a host is a system that provides resources for an X Server.  In a diskless workstation environment, the services provided by a host system will generally include session authentication using xauth and xhost, session management using xdm, file transfer services such as nfs and tftp which provide system fonts and a bootable image to be loaded into the X Terminal's RAM, and windowed client applications (e.g., Mozilla, Open Office).  </P

>Our environment consists of 25 diskless workstations with 15 workstations using Mozilla, 6 worsktations utilizing a proprietary graphical application written in Java, and 4 workstations with an application running under a terminal emulator.The 6 java-based workstations use Gnome as their desktop environment.  The remaining 19 workstations use FVWM2.  To support that environment, we use 2 dual processor pentium 3's.  One system has 1 gig of ram, the other has 500 megs.  We have found that the stations running Gnome and Java use dramatically more memory and cpu than the stations running Mozilla. </P

>In order to use Linux as a host for a network of thin client workstations, you will want to get the latest release of the XFree86 X Windows System, FVWM2, and nfs-utils.  Assuming that you are using an RPM-based distribution, you will want the following packages: Xfree86-font-utils, Xfree86-libs, Xfree86-devel, Xfree86, Xfree86-truetype-font, Xfree86-xdm, Xfree86-base-fonts, nfs-utils, fvwm2, fvwm2-icons.  To verify installed packages on an rpm-based distribution such as Redhat, you can use "rpm-qa | grep (packagename)".  To install or update those packages simply download them from their maintainer or from your installation media with and "rpm -Uvh (packagename)".  Alternately, you can use a graphical front end to rpm such as gnoRPM to maintain the required packages are installed on your system.  For debian-based systems, or for Gentoo, please consult your system documentation on apt-get and portage, respectively.</P

>The X Font Server (xfs) provides system fonts to X display servers.  It is the only way to provide anti-aliased fonts such as freetype to most X Terminals.</P
><P
>On most Linux systems, xfs is started from a script in <TT

>, and/or on startup from one or more scripts, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>  <TT

Some X Terminals use the default xfs port, 7100, for other services, so xfs can be run on an unassigned port, such as 7102, in order to avoid a conflict.</P
><P
>On most systems, the configuration for XFS is in <TT

>One of the dangers associated with the thin client model is that a runaway process might eat up all of the available system memory and/or cpu on the host system.  When this happens, the performance on that system can degrade resulting in system hangs, freezes, and a host of other generally undesirable consequences.</P
><P
>Fortunately, Linux comes with a set of facilities to mitigate these kinds of problems.  The first tool that we will look at is the limits.conf file located in /etc/security.  limits.conf provides the ability to specify user and group level limits to certain types of system resources, including memory.  Limits set in this file are set on a per user or per group basis. Though there are many limits that can be set in this file, we will address only a few in this tutorial. </P
><P
>The basic syntax for limits.conf consists of individual lines with values of the following types:  (domain) (type) (item) (value) where domain is user or group, type refers to a hard or soft limit, item refers to the resource being limited and value referring to the value associated with the limit being set.  For example, setting the following value:</P

>6.1. The Boot Process</A
></H3
><P
>When an X Terminal is booted from a host on the network, it may either use bootp or rarp to determine ip and host addresses, or it may store those values locally in NVRAM on the terminal.  The advantage to using bootp is that the host information and ip addresses may be stored centrally in a single configuration.  An advantage to using the values locally on the client system is that it allows for a more fine-grained control over tcp/ip and host information.   </P
><P
>Assuming that host and ip address information is properly configured for the X Terminal, step two in the boot process is for the X Terminal to load its operating system and core fonts.  In order to do this, the client needs to know the full path to the OS image and system configurations and base fonts.  It needs to have a boot method specified for fetching these files.  On most systems, that is tftp or nfs.  Last, the X Terminal needs to know which will be managing the XDMCP communication ( i.e., the system from which client applications will be deployed ).  All of this information is stored in NVRAM on the X Terminal.</P
><P
>Step three in the boot process occurs when the X Terminal connects to the client machine.  Most X Terminals can send a direct or indirect query to an xdmcp session manager on a network.  In an indirect query, all available xdmcp session managers will respond and display a menu of possible hosts.  In the case of a direct query, xdm on the host system runs the Xsetup script which sets up the display for the login screen and provides the xlogin widget which requires a valid userid and password to login and start an xdmcp session.</P
