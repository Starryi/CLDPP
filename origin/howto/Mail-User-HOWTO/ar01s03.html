mail to another (single) address.  There are two kinds of aliases:
MUA aliases and MTA aliases.</p><p>An MUA alias is one you set up in your MUA as a kind of personal
shorthand.  Other people will not be able to see or use this alias.
For example, you could write:</p><pre class="programlisting">
alias esr	Eric S. Raymond	&lt;esr@thyrsus.com&gt;
</pre><p>in your mutt configuration file.  This would tell mutt that when it
sees `esr' in an address line, it should behave as through you had
typed `esr@thyrsus.com',  Or you can type `mutt esr' and the expanded
address will be automatically filled in on the `to' line.</p><p>An MTA alias is one your MTA expands; it will be usable by
everyone, both on your machine and remotely.  To create MTA aliases
you must modify a system file, usually but not always
<code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code> or
<code class="filename">/etc/mail/aliases</code> (the location depends on your
MTA).  It may be instructive for you to look at the aliases on
your system; it should contain a number of standard aliases such as
`postmaster'.</p><p>Your MTA may also allow the target of an alias to be a filename, which
will be treated as a mailbox the mail is to be appended to (this is
useful for archiving mail).  It may also allow the target of an alias
to be a program, in which case mail to that alias will be passed to
an instance of the program on its standard input.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="forwarding"></a>3.2. Forwarding</h3></div></div></div><p>MTA aliases usually require administrator privileges to set up.  But
it is desirable for mail users to be able to set up forwarding of
their own mail without administrator intervention.</p><p>To support this, most MTAs follow sendmail's lead and look for a file
called
<code class="filename">.forward</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm136"></a>
in your home directory.  The contents of this file is interpreted like the
target of an alias which should receive all your mail; it should be a
single address.  The most common use for this facility is to redirect your
mail to an account on another machine.</p><p>To amplify: The existence of the .forward file, regardless of whats
in it, tells the system to treat the contents of the file as an alias
target for all your mail. If you create an empty .forward file, your mail
disappears. Most people use this to forward their mail to another machine,
so most often there is just one email address in the first line, and
nothing else. The MTA will honor whatever is on the first line of your
.forward file as the target of an alias. Everything else is ignored. If the
target is misformatted, just like any other alias, then the mail
disappears.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="autoreply"></a>3.3. Auto-replying</h3></div></div></div><p>Another common use for the <code class="filename">.forward</code>
facility is to pass your mail to a `vacation' program.  A vacation
program reads incoming mail and automatically generates a canned reply
to it; they are so called because the most common form of canned reply
is to inform the sender that you are on vacation and will not be
reachable until a given date.</p><p>There is no one standard vacation program that is in universal use.  
There are two good reasons for this: one, that such a program is
very easy to write as a shellscript or filter rule (see below); and
two, that vacation programs interact badly with mailing lists.</p><p>You should temporarily unsubscribe from all mailing lists you are on
before setting up auto-answering; otherwise, all members of the
mailing lists mail find they are being flooded with canned messages
by your vacation program.  This is considered very rude behavior
and will guarantee you quite a frosty reception on your return.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="lists"></a>3.4. Mailing lists</h3></div></div></div><p>A mailing list is a pseudo-address that sends mail to more than
one user.</p><p>In its simplest form, mailing list is just an MTA alias with more than
one recipient. Some small mailing lists are maintained this way.
Sendmail assists by supporting a syntax in <code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code>
that includes the contents of a given mailing list file in the target
side of an alias.  It looks like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
admin-list:     ":include:/usr/home/admin/admin-list"
</pre><p>with the advantage that the admin-list file can live in
unprivileged-user space somewhere (root is only needed to set
up the original inclusion). Some other MTAs have similar features.</p><p>These simple lists are commonly called `mail
reflectors<a class="indexterm" name="idm153"></a>'.
There are a couple of problems with mail reflectors.  One is that
bounce messages from failed attempts to broadcast goes to all users.
Another is that all subscriptions and unsubscriptions have to be done
manually by the mailing list administrator.</p><p>A kind of software called a mailing list
manager<a class="indexterm" name="idm156"></a>
has evolved to address these problems and other related ones.  Its
most important function is to permit mailing list users to subscribe
and unscubscribe without going through the list maintainer.</p><p>A mailing-list manager keeps its own user-list information and
hooks up to the MTA through a program alias in
<code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code>.  For example, if the admin-list
above were going through the mailing list manager called SmartList on
a sendmail system, a portion of <code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code>
might look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
admin-list: "|/usr/home/smartlist/bin/flist admin-list"
admin-list-request: "|/usr/home/smartlist/bin/flist admin-list-request"
</pre><p>Note that this is a pair of aliases.  It is conventional for
real mailing lists to have a request
address<a class="indexterm" name="idm163"></a> to be
used for user subscription and unsubscription requests.  It is
considered rude and ignorant to send subscription/unsubscription
requests to the main address of such a list -- don't do it.</p><p>The robot sitting behind the request address may offer other features
besides just subscription/unsubscription.  It may respond to help
requests, allow you to query who is on the list, or give you automated
access to list archives.  It may also allow list administrators to
restrict posting to known members, set the list to auto-subscribe
nonmembers when they first post, or set various security policy
options.  Mailing-list managers differ primarily in the design and
range of these secondary features.</p><p>Unfortunately, the format for sending commands to mailing-list request
robots is not standard.  Some expect commands in the subject line, 
some ignore the subject line and expect commands in the message body.
You need to pay attention to the response mail you get when you first
subscribe; it's a good idea to save such mail to a subscriptions
mailbox for later reference.</p><p>The most important mailing-list managers to know about are majordomo,
listserv, listproc, and smartlist; majordomo is the most popular by a
considerable margin.  Recently, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html" target="_top">mailman</a>, a
list manager with a rather nice Web-based signon/signoff/administration
interface, has become very popular and may be in the pricess of obsolescing
the older programs.  There is a rather comprehensive <a class="ulink" href="http://www.catalog.com/vivian/mailing-list-software.html" target="_top">list</a>
of such packages on the Web.</p><p>For more about mailing list managers, consult the resources at
the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.greatcircle.com/list-managers/" target="_top">List-Managers Mailing
List</a>, including the FAQ (note: this list is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> appropriate for how-to questions).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="filters"></a>3.5. Mail filters</h3></div></div></div><p>A mail filter<a class="indexterm" name="idm176"></a> is a program that sits between your local
delivery agent and you, automatically dispatching or rejecting mail
before you see it.</p><p>Mail filters have a number of uses.  The most important are spam
filtering, dispatching to multiple mailboxes by topic or sender, and
auto-answering mail.</p><p>Typically, you set up mail filtering by putting a program alias
for the filter program in your .forward file, and writing a file of
filtering rules.  The format and location of the filter rules file
varies between filter programs.</p><p>There are good feature summaries of the three major mail filters
(procmail, mailagent, and deliver) in <a class="ulink" href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/mail/setup/unix/part3/index.html" target="_top">part
3</a> of Chris Lewis's Email Software Survey.  The most popular of
these is (despite its rather nasty rule syntax) procmail, which is
universally present on Linux systems (and, indeed, is generally used
as the system's local delivery agent).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="spam"></a>3.6. Coping with spam</h3></div></div></div><p>Spam is sometimes known as `UCE' (Unsolicited Commercial Email)
or `UBE' (Unsolicited Bulk Email).  As these names imply, it is an
obnoxious form of advertising that stuffs your mailbox with form
letters.  (The term `spam' comes from a Monty Python's Flying Circus
skit in which a choir of Vikings endlessly repeats the chant "Spam
spam spam spam...").</p><p>Most spam seems to consist of solicitations for pyramid schemes,
ads for pornography, or (annoyingly) attempts to sell spam-sending
programs.  A few individual spams (like MAKE MONEY FAST or the Craig
Shergold postcard hoax) have been so persistent as to become
legendary.  Spam tends to be both verbose and illiterate.  It's a
waste of time and a huge waste of network bandwidth.</p><p>If you're being deluged with spam, get educated.  Browse the <a class="ulink" href="http://spam.abuse.net/" target="_top">Fight Spam on the Internet!</a> page.  The
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/nospam.html" target="_top">Death To
Spam!</a> page is particularly effective on methods for stopping or
backtracking spam.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2. Mail User Agents </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 4. Other sources of information</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
