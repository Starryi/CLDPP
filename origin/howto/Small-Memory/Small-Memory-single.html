>Assuming buying more memory is out of the question there are many
			things you can do to tighten up memory usage in Linux. </P
><P
>Many Linux distributions out of the box are quite bloated from a
			memory perspective. They run more services and offer more features than most of
			us will ever need. By removing many of these services you can free up several
			megabytes of real memory.</P
><P
> My own system is a 486DX2-66 with 12MB of physical memory and 12MB
			of swap space. It has run Linux for the last 3 years quite happily, and
			hopefully it will run Linux for several more years. :)</P

></H2
><P
>All the Linux kernels which come with distributions are quite
			bloated and contain more features than any of us will ever need or use. If you
			have not re-compiled your own kernel, it is highly recommended that you do so.
			How to re-compile a kernel is beyond the scope of this document, but many
			excellent Linux books and guides cover this subject in intimate detail.</P
><P
>If you do re-compile your kernel, remember to put in no more
			features than you need. For instance: how many of you include PLIP support in
			your kernel? How many of you who include it actually use it? Smaller kernels
			require less time to load, use less memory, and use less CPU cycles. </P
><P
>Another thing is modules. I personally do not use them because I
			found them to be a cumbersome. If you use them and like them then they can help
			to relieve "kernel bloat." </P

>VCs are a great way to free up memory. Most Linux distributions run
			about 6 of them out of the box. On average running 6 VCs requires about 4MB of
			memory. Removing a couple of them can free up a couple MBs of memory. Most
			users can get away with running only 3 or 4 VCs. How many you choose to remove
			is a matter personal preference. Just remember that the fewer you run, the more
			memory your applications will have to run. </P
