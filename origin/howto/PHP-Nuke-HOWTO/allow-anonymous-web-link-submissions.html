>We first thought that if the Web Links module was visible by all visitors, it would also allow them to suggest a link. We tried it, but we got the error:</P

>You are not a registered user or you have not logged in.</P
><P
>If you were registered you could add links on this website.</P
><P
>Becoming a registered user is a quick and easy process.</P
><P
>Why do we require registration for access to certain features?</P
><P
>So we can offer you only the highest quality content,</P
><P
>each item is individually reviewed and approved by our staff.</P
><P
>We hope to offer you only valuable information.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>Obviously, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> made a check if this was a registered user - and issued that statement. But where was this check located in the code?</P
><P
>To find it, we used the same bottom-up approach of <A
HREF="common-installation-problems.html#SORRY-SUCH-FILE-DOESNT-EXIST"
>Section 3.9.6</A
> and <A
HREF="find-all-registration-links.html"
>Section 26.5</A
>: </P
><P
>We first had to find the place where the above error was echoed. We thus searched the whole code tree for all occurences of a word that most probably would appear only in the error above - we chose the word "valuable". It turned out that the word "valuable" was in some unrelated text consntants - but it was also in the _LINKSNOTUSER7 text constant that was translated in all modules/Web_Links/language/lang-XXXX.php files!</P
><P
>Armed with this information, we only had to do a second search, this time for all occurences of the string "_LINKSNOTUSER" in the whole code tree of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
>. We got again dozens of language files in the output, but we also got the modules/Web_Links/index.php file. Indeed, if at all, it must be this file where the check is made! </P
><P
>We thus checked the relevant lines of modules/Web_Links/index.php and the code went like this:</P

>We first thought we had to remove the check "if is user", but then we saw that "or $links_anonaddlinklock == 1" which made us suspicious. So there was some kind of configuration variable ( $links_anonaddlinklock) which can control the outcome of the test!</P
><P
>We know from experience that such variables are set in a separate <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
> file, in the same folder of the module. If you didn't have this experience, then you would just have to do a third search for all occurences of the string "links_anonaddlinklock" in the text of all files - there shouldn't be that many.</P
