>Born  as the heart of PHP-Nuke, it was the obligatory Home Page in previous versions. In the last versions it is instead possible to define which modules should appear as the default page.</P
><P
>The News module expands its branches on more pages. The first one we see is a collection of the latest News published (it is possible , from the configuration panel [admin-&#62;preferences] to choose the number of latest news to be displayed, say 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). In the main page only a small initial text of the news article is published. If the text is too large, it will be possible to read it whole by pressing the link &#8220;Read more&#8221;.</P
><P
>The article module has many elements that distinguish it from other ones. In the first place, the title, the topic, that is the main category and is usually characterized by an image that, if clicked, brings up a selection of the articles that belong to this topic (starting from version 6.6, it is possible to assign more than one topics to one article). We have a second way to classify the articles, which is to assign them a category they are supposed to belong (see <A

We can also base our selection on which files were downloaded most, or which ones obtained the highest score.
