>Here is a little unorthodox example of what you can achieve by modifying the theme footer: </P
><P
>Suppose you just wonder how you can make a new table to the right of each page (<A
HREF="php-nuke-theme-modifying-footer.html#INSERT-RIGHT-EXTRA-TABLE"
>Section 14.6.1</A
>), perhaps because you want to put an advertisement table there. The standard way to do this would be to write a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> block (see <A
HREF="blocks.html"
>Chapter 20</A
>), insert it in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> through the block management panel (see <A
HREF="admin-management.html"
>Section 9.4</A
>), position it in the right column, then define its relative position to the other blocks in the right column through the intuitive graphical arrows in the block table of the block management panel.</P
><P
>An alternative way is to edit your theme.php. There, in the function themefooter(), you should see an IF statement for the blocks(right):</P
