We have of course to track this case down and use such a &#8220;file&#8221; accordingly, i.e split it internally into its parts, determine the parameter-value pairs and the name of the script to execute and pass the parameters (name=Your_Account, op=edituser, username=chris) to that script (modules.php) for execution. </P

>Section 25.5.1.3</A

><P
>The GoogleTap works as follows:</P
><P
>The header.php file starts output buffering. This delays the output - all contents are temporarily sent to an internal buffer. It also defines a function, replace_for_mod_rewrite(). This function takes a sole argument (a variable) and replaces every occurence of a member of the urlin array with the respective member of the urlout array (we have seen the urlin and urlout arrays already in <A
HREF="make-php-nuke-search-engine-friendly.html#GOOGLETAP-INSTALLATION"
>Section 25.5.1.2</A
>). You can view the urlin and urlout arrays as ordered collections of regular expressions (see <A
HREF="regular-expressions.html"
>Section 25.3</A
>), where the first member of urlin corresponds to the first member of urlout, the second member of urlin to the second member of urlout and so forth. </P
><P
>The replace_for_mod_rewrite() function examines the contents of the variable that was passed to it as argument (remember that in <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
> a variable can hold the contents of a whole page - in fact, in our case, it does exactly that!) and replaces every occurence of the first regular expression in urlin, with the first element of urlout. It does so with all other regular expressions of urlin - if it finds a string that matches the nth regular expression, it replaces that string with the nth array member of urlout. The first five replacement pairs<A

>The replace_for_mod_rewrite() function is not called in header.php though - it is only defined there. As its name says, header.php outputs the <EM

HREF="modifying-php-nuke-html-header.html"
>Chapter 15</A
>). It would be too early to call replace_for_mod_rewrite() during header generation. Instead, everything is meticulously gathered in the &#8220;output buffer&#8221; of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
> (to learn more about output buffering in PHP, see <A
HREF="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/OutputBuffering/page1.html"

><P
>As <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> outputs the page contents (which continue to land in the output buffer), it eventually reaches the page footer. This is the job of footer.php. We already saw in <A
HREF="make-php-nuke-search-engine-friendly.html#GOOGLETAP-INSTALLATION"
>Section 25.5.1.2</A
> that it is the footer who calls replace_for_mod_rewrite(): it stops buffering, saves the buffer contents in a variable, cleans up the buffer and calls replace_for_mod_rewrite(). </P
><P
>What are the contents of the output buffer at this stage? You guessed -it - the whole page, all the HTML that comprises the &#8220;page source&#8221; (the HTML code you see when you hit the &#8220;View source&#8221; menu entry of your browser. Without GoogleTap, this would be the HTML code that would be sent to your browser to render the page, with all its text and links and...</P
><P
>Huh! Did I say links? What if your page contains dynamic links? In fact, it is very unusual for a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> page to NOT contain any dynamic links. Dont't they have to be replaced with their static pendants too? Of course they do! Thus, it should be clear to you by now, that just by changing the URLs from dynamic to static, we are by far not done - we have to do this for every URL contained in the HTML of our page. </P
><P
>Well, that's exactly what that call of replace_for_mod_rewrite() in the footer does: it passes the whole page as argument to replace_for_mod_rewrite(), which then does an elaborate &#8220;search and replace&#8221; in the whole page, according to the urlin and urlout arrays, as indicated by <A
HREF="make-php-nuke-search-engine-friendly.html#TAB-URLIN-URLOUT"
>Table 25-1</A
>. </P
><P
>This completes the translation from dynamic to static: the browser gets a page where every dynamic link of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> has been replaced by a static one. The user - and the search engine - sees only static links on the page to follow. </P
><P
>What's more, through the changes we did in sessions.php during installation (see <A
HREF="make-php-nuke-search-engine-friendly.html#GOOGLETAP-INSTALLATION"
>Section 25.5.1.2</A
>), we have already taken care that if the visitor is a search engine bot, it will not be shown the session <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ID</ACRONYM
> on the URL. Normal users will continue to see it, though. With this ingenious method, we get the best of two worlds: users can rely on the security and comfort that <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
