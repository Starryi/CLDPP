>1) The new code will be closed. This means that script kiddies should get a computer science master or PhD before hacking it. This will reduce the security issues. From time to time, a security test will be made on the code to catch those bugs and fix them.</P

><P
>This is a well-known method of securing your programs - it is called <A
HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_by_obscurity"
TARGET="_top"
>security by obscurity</A
>. A system relying on security by obscurity may have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities, but its owners or designers believe that the flaws are not known, and that attackers are unlikely to find them.</P
><P
>Would you trust such a system to be secure? Would you run a Fortune 500 website on top of it? It is in this light that you have to interpret nessus' warning above. Relying on security by obscurity as a strategy for PHP-Nuke, be it only in a thought experiment, will not persuade the security experts at nessus.org. Because in the cryptography world, the reverse of security by obscurity is believed to be true: <A
HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle"
TARGET="_top"
>Kerckhoffs' principle</A
> from the late 1880s, which states that system designers should assume that the entire design of a security system is known to all attackers, with the exception of cryptographic key secrets.</P
><P
>In practice, operators of systems that rely on security by obscurity often keep the fact that their system is broken secret, so as not to destroy confidence in their service or product (see <A
HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_by_obscurity"
TARGET="_top"
>security by obscurity</A
>). Examples of such systems are the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
> &#8220;operating system&#8221; and the IIS web server. According to its creator above, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> may join them in the future. This has not kept large firms from using these products for their web presence, though. It is therefore up to you how you interpret nessus' warning and Francisco's tendency to resort to controversial security principles.</P

>People have commented on Francisco's thoughts in that article, the sleepless nights trying to close the security holes that were afflicting thousands of <SPAN

>Oral cultures do not share this belief. Knowledge is open-ended. People may hold differing opinions without one person being wrong. There is not necessarily one truth; there may be many truths.

Try to figure out which perspective Shakespeare thinks is correct.</P
