>Making your own personal graphical theme for your site is very important so that you don't have another <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> clone, if your site looks the same as other sites it dosn't make you, the Webmaster look very professional. Personalising the portal starts from the graphical side of things. Knowing how to put your hands on a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> theme means being able to play with all of the graphical elements that we can use. The example theme we will use in this chapter is the NukeNews theme, made by Francisco Burzi for <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
>. It's a theme composed of a lot of HTML files, all included in theme.php. This is a very good solution that permits you to manage the graphical part of the theme through an editor like DreamWeaver using the least amount of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
> code.</P
><P
>For a graphical anatomy of a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> theme, please have a look at the <A
HREF="theme.html"
TARGET="_top"
>theme.html</A
> file. As you can see, each <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> page follows the classic 3-column table layout: in the left and right columns you can position small blocks, while in the center, wider column, you should position the larger blocks. It is also the center column where the currently viewed module is shown.</P
><P
>The NukeNews theme, for example, is structured in the following way (<A

>These files are included in the functions specified in theme.php We then have a style sheet (<A
HREF="css-syntax.html"
>Section 28.3</A
>), called style.css (style/style.css), included in the header.html file in our theme folder. For convention, the style sheet must always be called style.css and must always be contained in one folder called "style" inside of our theme folder. The images generally are grouped in a folder called "images" that is always found in our themes folder. </P

>The theme.php file is the heart of all PHP-Nuke's graphical management. The theme.php is the file that creates the managing functions of all of PHP-Nuke's components (header, footer, central parts, block...).</P
><P
>The technique of putting HTML code in separate files, that are then included in theme.php, is not used in all themes (see <A
HREF="topic-structure.html#FIG-THEME-STRUCTURE-OTHER"
>Figure 14-2</A
>). Some programmers include all the HTML in the theme.php file. However, including it separately solves many problems such as HTML formatting, that would otherwise be included in the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
> code. It also gives us the possibility of editing all with a visual editor (WYSIWYG). </P

>It then defines the footer messages (which are captured from config.php) and inserts all them in a variable that is recalled from the footer.html file. </P
><P
>The function themeindex() manages the news in Home Page and formats them adding elements according to various cases using the function "if". It also includes the story_home.htm file.</P
><P
>The function themearticle() instead manages the internal news page (that we can see by pushing on "Read more..."; remember that the layout part in this case is achieved by including the story_page.htm file, but the blocks that must be included (i.e. the article's survey, correlated links etc.) are defined by the news module. </P
><P
>The function themesidebox() instead manages the layout of the box that we create or that we find already made (see <A
HREF="blocks.html"
>Chapter 20</A
>), it too includes a file called blocks.htm that defines the style and the layout. </P
><P
>We have ignored an element of the file theme.php. These are the variables that format the text, some of them are inserted in css (the style sheet) but others are instead defined at the beginning of the theme.php file. </P

>Now we have to examine what is included in the tables.php file. This file creates 4 functions (opentable(); closetable(); opentable2(); closetable2();) that include HTML tags that open and close tables in a predefined way.</P
