></H2
><P
>Post-Nuke is another Content Management System (CMS) similar to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
>. Whilst PostNuke is a fork of PHP-Nuke, the entire core of the product has been replaced, with the aim of making it more secure and stable, and able to work in high-volume environments with ease.</P
><P
>Some of the highlights of PostNuke are, according to its developers (in <A
HREF="http://developing.postnukemodules.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Post-Nuke Modules</A
>):</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Customisation of all aspects of the website's appearance through themes, including CSS support.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The ability to specify items as being suitable for either a single or all languages.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The best guarantee of displaying your webpages on all browsers due to HTML 4.01 transitional compliance.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A standard API and extensive documentation to allow for easy creation of extended functionality through modules and blocks.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The merits of Post-Nuke, as compared to those of PHP-Nuke, have been subject of controversial discussion among fans of both CMSs. We cannot give an objective opinion, since we are biased towards <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
>. <SPAN
CLASS="INLINEMEDIAOBJECT"
><IMG
SRC="./images/icon_wink.png"></SPAN
> However, we will try to give you an idea:</P
><P
>Even its critics will agree that, for a portal whose purpose is to make information publicly accessible, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> is a very good solution. In comparison to Post-Nuke, most people will also find that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
> has many more modules available. However, some will argue that most of them seem geared toward the average end user and not a business or corporate environment.</P
><P
>On the plus side, PostNuke has a very detailed strict user permissions system allowing you to limit access to every module and area of your site to a general group or a specific user. The permissions system allows you to create groups and users with special permissions. You can add a user to one or many of these groups to give a variety of complex permissions easily. This is handy if you need moderators, sub admins, and other people helping manage a commercial site and wish to limit admin access. This may make PostNuke more appealing to a professional site - but see the Your Account Tweak module (<A
HREF="php-nuke-add-on-modules.html#NSN-YOUR-ACCOUNT-TWEAK-MODULE"
>Section 8.3.3</A
>), the Approve Membership module  ( <A
HREF="php-nuke-add-on-modules.html#PHP-NUKE-APPROVE-MEMBERSHIP-MODULE"
>Section 8.3.4</A
>), the eCommerce modules (<A
HREF="php-nuke-add-on-modules.html#PHP-NUKE-ECOMMERCE-MODULE"
>Section 8.3.14</A
>) or the Project Management WorkBoard module (<A
HREF="php-nuke-add-on-modules.html#PHP-NUKE-WORKBOARD-MODULE"
>Section 8.3.15</A
>)  before you draw premature conclusions. <SPAN

>However, PostNuke seems to be caught prisoner of its own development impetus: it changed so fast, so often, and made code break backward compatibility in newer versions so often, that it became difficult even for seasoned webmasters to follow it. Lack of compatibility even between adjacent versions and rumours on its development being suspended, has robbed the nerve of quite a few people, who then turned back to <SPAN
