CLASS="APPLICATION"

>Linux Preview</A
>. First, around August 1998, I wrote my own code in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

>Well, then I discovered Thatware, a good project to have a news site under <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
>. I learned <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PHP</ACRONYM
> in less than a week and began modifying it. There are too many mods to mention, it was practicaly a rewrite. I added some cool stuff, deleted some others and after more than 380 hours of hard work in 3 weeks! <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

> was born.</P

>On August 17, 2000 I sold LinuxPreview.org to LinuxAlianza.com and now I have all the time to dedicate to the development of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP-Nuke</SPAN
>.</P

>From January 2001 to January 2002, <SPAN
