quite powerful. This section shows some examples of it's use. First, some simple examples: </p><pre class="screen">access to * by * read </pre><p>This access directive grants read access to everyone.</p><p>The following example shows the use of a regular expression to select the 
entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant. </p><pre class="screen">access to dn=".*, o=U of M, c=US" 
by * search 
access to dn=".*, c=US" 
by * read </pre><p>Read access is granted to entries under the c=US subtree, except for those 
entries under the "o=U of M, c=US" subtree, to which search access is granted. No access 
is granted to c=US as neither access directive matches this DN.If the order of these
access directives was reversed, the U-M-specific directive would never be matched, since 
all U-M entries are also c=US entries. </p><p>Another way to implement the same access controls is:</p><pre class="screen">access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
	by * search
	access to dn.children="dc=com"
	by * read
</pre><p>Read access is granted to entries under the dc=com subtree, except for those entries 
under the dc=example,dc=com subtree, to which search access is granted. No access is granted 
to dc=com as neither access directive matches this DN. If the order of these access directives 
was reversed, the trailing directive would never be reached, since all entries under 
dc=example,dc=com are also under dc=com entries.</p><p><span class="command"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Also note that if no access to directive or no "by &lt;who&gt;" clause matches, 
<span class="command"><strong>access is denied</strong></span>. That is, every <span class="emphasis"><em>access to</em></span> directive ends with an implicit <span class="emphasis"><em>by * none </em></span>clause 
and every access list ends with an implicit <span class="emphasis"><em>access to * by * none</em></span> directive.</p><p>The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access 
directives and the "by &lt;who&gt;" clauses. It also shows the use of an attribute selector
 to grant access to a specific attribute and various &lt;who&gt; selectors. </p><pre class="screen">access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attr=homePhone
	by self write
	by dn.children=dc=example,dc=com" search
	by peername=IP:10\..+ read
access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
	by self write
	by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
	by anonymous auth
</pre><p>This example applies to entries in the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree. To all 
attributes except homePhone, an entry can write to itself, entries under 
example.com entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit by * none) 
excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously). The 
homePhone attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under example.com, 
readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable 
(implicit by * none). All other access is denied by the implicit access to * by * none.</p><p>Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove itself from 
an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a group and allow people
 to add and remove only their own DN from the member attribute, you could accomplish 
 it with an access directive like this: </p><pre class="screen">access to attr=member,entry 
	by dnattr=member selfwrite 
</pre><p>The dnattr &lt;who&gt; selector says that the access applies to entries listed
in the member attribute. The selfwrite access selector says that such members 
can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The 
addition of the entry attribute is required because access to the entry is 
required to access any of the entry's attributes. </p><p>There's plenty of information about Access Control on the OpenLDAP
Administrator's Guide. Take a look at: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin22/slapdconfig.html#Access%20Control" target="_top">Access Control</a>
