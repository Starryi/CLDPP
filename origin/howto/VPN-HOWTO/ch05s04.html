If you are building a server that has only one network card, I suggest
that you think about buying another, and rewiring your network.  The
best way to keep your network private is to keep it on it's own wires. 
So if you do have two network cards, you'll need to know how to
configure both of them.  We'll use eth0 for the external interface, and eth1 for
the internal interface.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm428"></a>4.1. Configuring the interfaces</h3></div></div></div><p>
We first should configure the external interface of the server.  You
should already know how to do this, and probably already have it done. 
If you don't, then do so now.  If you don't know how, go back and read
the <a class="ulink" href="/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.html" target="_top">Networking HOWTO</a>
</p><p>
Now we bring up the internal interface.  According to the numbers that
we've chosen, the internal interface of the server is 192.168.40.254.
so we have to configure that interface.
</p><p>
For 2.0 kernels, use the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
# /sbin/ifconfig eth1 192.168.40.254 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.40.255
# /sbin/route add -net 192.168.40.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1
</pre><p>
For 2.2 kernels, use the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
# /sbin/ifconfig eth1 192.168.40.254 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.40.255
</pre><p>
That gets our basic interfaces up.  You can now talk to machines on
both local networks that are attached to the server.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm438"></a>4.2. Setting routes</h3></div></div></div><p>
We can now talk to machines on our local nets, but we can't get to the rest
of our internal network.  That requires a few more lines of code.  In order
to reach the other machines on other subnets, we need have a route that tells
traffic to go to the Cisco router. Here's that line:
</p><pre class="screen">
# /sbin/route add -net 192.168.0.0 gw 192.168.254.254 netmask 255.255.0.0 dev eth1
</pre><p>
That line tells the kernel that any traffic destined for the 192.168.0.0 network
should go out eth1, and that it should be handed off to the Cisco.  Traffic for
our local net still gets where it is supposed to because the routing tables
are ordered by the size of the netmask.  If we were to have other internal nets
in our network, we would have a line like the above for each net.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm443"></a>4.3. Making filter rules</h3></div></div></div><p>
Now that we can reach every machine that we could need to, we need to write
the firewall filtering rules that allow or deny access through the VPN server.
</p><p>
To set the rules with <span class="command"><strong>ipfwadm</strong></span>, run it like so:
</p><pre class="screen">
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -f
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -p deny
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -S 192.168.40.0/24 -D 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -S 192.168.10.0/24 -D 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -S 192.168.11.0/24 -D 192.168.0.0/16
</pre><p>
To set the rules with <span class="command"><strong>ipchains</strong></span>, run it like so:
</p><pre class="screen">
# /sbin/ipchains -F forward
# /sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY
# /sbin/ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.40.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT -b -s 192.168.10.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT -b -s 192.168.11.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/16
</pre><p>
This tells the kernel to deny all traffic except for the traffic that is coming
from the 192.168.40.0/24 network and destined for the 192.168.0.0/16 network. It
also tells the kernel that traffic going between the 192.168.10.0/24 and
192.168.0.0/16 nets is allowed, and the same for the 192.168.11.0 net.  These
last two are bidirectional rules, this is important for getting the routing
to work going both ways.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm453"></a>4.4. Routing</h3></div></div></div><p>
For home users, everything will work fine to here.  However
for the remote offices, we need to do some routing.  First of all, we
need to tell the main router, or Cisco, that the remote offices are
behind the VPN server.  So specify routes on the Cisco that tell
it to send traffic destined for the remote offices to the VPN server.
Now that is taken care of, we must tell the VPN server what to do
with the traffic destined for the remote offices.  To do this, we run the
<span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> command on the server.  The only problem is that in order
for the <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> command to work, the link must be up, and if
it goes down, the route will be lost.  The solution is to add the routes
when the clients connects, or more simply, to run the route command frequently
as it's not a problem to run it more than is necessary.  So, create a script
and add it to your crontab to be run every few minutes,  in the script, put the
following:
</p><pre class="screen">
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.11.0 gw 192.168.10.253 netmask 255.255.255.0
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.10.0 gw 192.168.11.253 netmask 255.255.255.0
