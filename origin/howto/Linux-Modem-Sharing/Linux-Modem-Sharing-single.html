     Subject: Windows-Modemsharing-Howto

     Hi !

     The howto mentions DialOut/IP as a good tool to connect Windows
     clients to a linux server sharing a modem.

     I agree. However, it would be more attractive to have a free,
     GPL'ed client, wouldn't it ? This I thought and decided to offer
     some money for the implementation of such a client on the
     Software Bazaar. If someone grabs the project I will pay him a
     certain amount of money if it is completed and functional. After
     that the client would be GPL'ed.

     Now, I can only offer so much money :) But other people could
     join in and offer some, too, thus increasing the incentive.
     Wouldn't your howto be a perfect place to mention this
     possibility ?

     The Bazaar can be found at:

      http://visar.csustan.edu/bazaar/

     Thought I could mention this to you.
