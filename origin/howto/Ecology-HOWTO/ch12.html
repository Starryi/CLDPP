Personally I'm not much a player of computer games but maybe they can be used for environmental education.
In a first investigation I found
<a class="ulink" href="http://lincity.sourceforge.net/" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>Lincity</strong></span></a>
and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sunysb.edu/philosophy/faculty/gmar/realife.html" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>Real Life</strong></span></a>,
please check their usefulness by yourself.

- Build &amp; maintain a
city/country. You are required to build and maintain a city.
You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for your
residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help
of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for broke
and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and
resource starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite
resources available in any one place, this is not a game
that you can leave for long periods of time. This game is
similar to the commercial simulation game with a similar
name. This package provides files common to both the X and
SVGALIB versions of the game.

- "In 
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_top">Conway's Game of Life</a> every cell
is either fully alive (has the value of 1) or completely
dead (has the value 0). In Real Life this restriction to
bivalence is lifted to countenance -real-valued- degrees
of life and death. Real Life contains Conway's Game of
Life as a special case; however, Real Life, in contrast to
Conway's Game of Life, exhibits sensitive dependence on
initial conditions which is characteristic of chaotic
systems."

has produced (some time ago) Eco Quest 1 - <span class="command"><strong>Lost in
Rainforest</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>Eco Quest 2 - The
Search for Cetus</strong></span>. The EcoQuest games were for
MS-DOS and Windows 3.x. These were targeted at younger
players.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
SimEarth, 1988, Maxis (DOS, Win3.x, Mac) Simulates the
development of a planet from the forming of the crust
to the spread of civilization. Based on James
Lovelock's Gaia theory. Somewhat dull and difficult to
learn, but there's a good amount of educational value
to be gotten out of fiddling around with the models,
particularly greenhouse effect.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Balance of the Planet, 1991, Chris Crawford (DOS, Mac):
You take the role of a government policy-maker
who must try to balance industry and ecology.
Remarkably complicated and drab (even moreso than
SimEarth), but certain to be educational and
thought-provoking if time is spent with the manual.
The Mac version can now be downloaded for free from
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/free.html" target="_top">Crawford's website</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Global Effect, 1992, Millennium (DOS, Amiga):
An early real-time strategy game where you must try
to conquer your opponent while dealing with the
ecological ramifications of your weapons and
industry upon your population. Clunky interface,
not a lot of fun compared to current Warcraft-type
games.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
SimIsle, 1995, Maxis (DOS, ???) Develop a
tropical island without destroying the
rainforest ecology. Large learning curve but
supposedly a lot of fun.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
SimPark, 1997, Maxis (Win 95, ???) Sort of a
children's version of SimIsle, which is
simpler and more education-focused.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I suspect the older games should run just fine on <span class="command"><strong>dosemu</strong></span>.
