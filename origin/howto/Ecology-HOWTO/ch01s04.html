Do they only prevent the screen from being burned in or do they save power, too?
</p><p>
Some recommendations from Wade Hampton:
Screensavers usually display graphics, look for ETI, or perform other tasks.  When using your screensaver in this manner, you may actually consume MORE power. For example a computer using XSETI as a screensaver might get far warmer (hence use more power) than when it was being used to edit a document or perform a compile.
</p><p>
Some screen saver programs:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
The purpose of <span class="command"><strong>xscreensaver</strong></span> is to display pretty pictures
on your screen when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that
unattended monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like
they do in the movies. The benefit that this program has over the
combination of the <span class="command"><strong>xlock</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>xautolock</strong></span> programs is the ease with which new graphics
hacks can be  installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a
new display mode, you just change some resource settings. Any program which
can be  invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen
can now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge about
what it means to be a screensaver.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>LockVC</strong></span> is a console-locking-program combined with a
starfield screensaver. Executing LOCKVC on a virtual console brings up a
starfield that starts to rotate around all three axes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-display-power"></a>4.2. Display Power Control</h3></div></div></div><p>
To really save power, and if your X server plus monitor supports it, use the <span class="command"><strong>dpms</strong></span> option of <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> (see the manual page for <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span>). For example, to enable the DPMS (Energy Star) features of you X server: <span class="command"><strong>xset +dpms</strong></span>
</p><p>
You may also manually change the mode of your X display: 
</p><pre class="programlisting">
xset dpms force standby
xset dpms force suspend
xset dpms force off
</pre><p>
Note that <span class="command"><strong>suspend</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>off</strong></span> usually save much more energy than just <span class="command"><strong>standby</strong></span>,
especially in CRT displays.
</p><p>
According to manufacturers, switching off LCD displays more often doesn't
reduce their lifetime. As user can easily notice, there is no significant penalty
either between suspend and off modes in terms of switching on time.
</p><p>
In modern graphical desktop environments (like Gnome and KDE),
it is easy to configure automatic display switch off after a given
inactivity timeout:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
KDE display power management: configure it in
<span class="command"><strong>Control Center -&gt; Peripherals -&gt; Display -&gt; Power Control</strong></span>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Gnome display power management: configure it in
<span class="command"><strong>Desktop -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Screensaver -&gt; AdvancedControl Center -&gt; Peripherals -&gt; Display -&gt; Power Control</strong></span>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
AFAIK a CRT consumes on the order of 25 percent more power when displaying a <span class="command"><strong>plain white</strong></span> screen than displaying a <span class="command"><strong>plain black</strong></span> screen. So, a screensaver that's mostly black can help save power, even if it doesn't actually use DPMS to power down the screen. Of course, one that's very bright and colourful, or that keeps the CPU running fast is not much help.
