BAN is a global network of toxics and development activist organizations that
share a vision of international environmental justice.  We seek to prevent all
forms of "toxic trade" -- in toxic wastes, toxic products and toxic
technologies.  BAN members will work nationally, regionally and globally to
accomplish the following mission:
The 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ban.org" target="_top">Basel Action Network (BAN)</a>
works to prevent the globalization of the toxic
chemical crisis.  In particular, we seek to ensure that the Basel Convention
and its ban (Decisions II/12 and III/1) on the export of hazardous wastes from
OECD to non-OECD countries will not be weakened, but rather ratified and
implemented at the earliest possible date.  We also seek to ensure that the
Basel Convention and other instruments and efforts, serve to prevent the trade
and growth of the world's most hazardous, and often obsolete industries,
particularly with respect to developing or newly industrializing countries.

"In 2005 the Romanian National Meteorological Administration (NMA) received EU funding for its AirAware project. The project's objective was to improve the air quality monitoring system currently in place and to enhance the system with forecasting capabilities. For the management of all the information and the presentation thereof, the team at the NMA developed a portal that is entirely built on Free/Libre Open Source Software. In the future, the team is hoping to open the project to the public."
