Abstract
The Linux-Ecology-HOWTO discusses ways to make computers less harmful to our
environment and to solve some ecological issues. It explains how to use Linux
to save power and consumables like paper and ink. Since it does not require big
hardware, Linux may be used with old computers to make their life cycle longer.
Games may be used in environmental education and software is available to
simulate ecological processes.

Life is the first gift, love is the second, and understanding is the third.
— Marge_Piercy
Though computers can be seen as part of environmental pollution, there are also
ways to use computers in a more reasonable manner to help protect the
environment. So I have just started to collect some means to do so with Linux.

1. Objectives

Some objectives of the HOWTO:

* Reduction in power consumption.
* Reduction in consumables like paper and inks.
* Reduction in waste by reusing older components or keeping them in service
  longer.
* Reduction in toxic waste such as used batteries.
* Use of Linux in environmental education and research.


2. Caveats

Some of the recommendations in this text are discussed controversial, for
instance: powering down a device, when it's not in use. This may save power,
but not under all circumstances. Also it may have other additional ecological
costs, e.g. the life time of the device can be shortened.
I don't have enough technological knowledge to make a decision between these
alternatives. Also some alternatives might be rated differently by different
persons. So finally the decision what to choose is up to you. Anyway if you
have better alternatives please let me know.

  8._Miscellaneous_Power_Saving_Techniques

There are some means to save power when using a computer which are supported by
Linux: Advanced Power Management, certain harddisk settings, working without
monitor and others.

1. Advanced Power Management (APM/ACPI)

Putting your GNU/Linux PC in suspend or hibernate mode.

1.1. ACPI

Most modern PCs support the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)
standard. The ACPI4Linux project works on implementing full ACPI support in the
Linux kernel, including fan control, dock/undock detection.
All ACPI related information (such as processor or board temperature) is
available through files in /proc/acpi. For example, this makes it very easy for
desktop environments (or for your own programs) to display to temperature
information somewhere on your screen.

1.1.1. Hibernate to disk

Use hibernate to disk and no longer be afraid of switching off your system.
Booting is much faster than having to wait for services and graphics to start
up. Actually, most of the time is saved by getting back to your work as you
left it before suspending your computer (open files, terminals, browser
windows). There is no need to re-open everything!
While hibernating is often considered as a power saving solution for notebook
computers, it should also be used for desktop computers, to save AC power. Use
it when you go for lunch, when you leave the office in the evening or for
holidays...
Hibernating also saves a lot of time when you replace a battery of a notebook.
Again, hibernate, install a fresh battery, power up and get back to your work
as you left it off.
Technical details

* Hibernation to disk is implemented by the Suspend_2_for_Linux project. It
  consists of a kernel driver and a user-space program to control the driver.
  Users just need to run the program (usually called hibernate).
* It works by copying the whole of used RAM to a swap partition. As a
  consequence, it requires the swap partition to be at least as big as the
  amount of RAM.
* Both the patched kernel and the user-space program are very easy to install
  through packages.

  o Here are Fedora_Core_packages for download.
  o At least in the 6.06 release of (K)Ubuntu, hibernating is directly
    available as an option from the battery icon.
  o Go to your favorite package source for other distributions



1.2. Older hardware with APM


1.2.1. Linux Compatibility Check

From the Battery_Powered_Linux_Mini-HOWTO " .. for APM to work on any notebook
or energy-conscious desktop, the system BIOS ROM in the machine must support
the APM standard. Furthermore, for APM to work with the Linux operating system,
the system BIOS ROM must support either the 1.0 or 1.1 version of the APM
standard, and it must also support 32-bit protected mode connections. A system
that supports APM 1.1 is preferred, as it provides more features that the
device driver and supporting utilities can take advantage of." You may get
information about the APM version with the dmesg command and in the /proc/apm
file.

1.2.2. Introduction

When you first install Linux, you will probably have to recompile the kernel.
The kernel that came with your distribution probably does not have APM enabled.
APM support consists of two parts: kernel support and user-land support.
For kernel support, enable the parameters in the corresponding kernel section.
AFAIK not all features work with laptops. AFAIK the feature
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF works with most laptops.
The utilities for userland support may be found at WorldVisions. APMD is a set
of programs that control the Advanced Power Management system found in most
modern laptop computers. If you run a 2.2.x kernel and want to experiment,
Gabor Kuti <seasons at falcon.sch.bme.hu> has made a kernel patch that allows
you to hibernate any Linux system to disk, even if your computers APM BIOS
doesn't support it directly.

1.2.3. Caveats

If you have another operating system preinstalled or use another operating
system at the same disk, make sure there is no "hibernation" or "suspend" tool
installed, which could severely interfere with Linux, e.g. it might use disk
space which is occupied by Linux or vice versa.

1.2.4. Troubleshooting

Sometimes X windows and APM don't work smoothly together, the machine might
even hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader: Some Linux systems have their X
server hang when doing apm -s. Folks with this affliction might want switch to
the console virtual terminal then suspend chvt 1; apm -s as root, or, more
appropriately, sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s. I have these commands in a script,
say, my-suspend and then do xapmload --click-command my-suspend .
On some new machines (for instance HP Omnibook 4150 - 366 MHz model) when
accessing /proc/apm, you may get a kernel fault general protection fault: f000.
Stephen_Rothwell explains: "This is your APM BIOS attempting to use a real mode
segment while in protected mode, i.e. it is a bug in your BIOS. .. We have seen
a few of these recently, except all the others are in the power off code in the
BIOS wher we can work around it by returning to real mode before attempting to
power off. Here we cannot do this."

1.3. Processor frequency scaling

cpufreq is a Linux kernel driver to control the CPU frequency. It is included
in all recent kernels and enabled by default by recent distributions. It
supports most recent "mobile" processors. Note that only such processors
support frequency scaling.
This driver lets user programs control cpu frequency by writing files in /sys/
devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/cpufreq/.
Actually, frequency scaling is usually handled by a governor program, according
to system or user specific preferences.
CPUSpeedis the de-facto governor for Linux. It allows to control the cpufreq
driver according to user defined criteria: CPU load, board temperature, battery
/ plugged in... It is released by default in recent distributions.
CPUspeed is usually configured through the /etc/cpuspeed.conf file (Fedora Core
4 example):

  VMAJOR=1
  VMINOR=1
  DRIVER="speedstep-centrino"
  OPTS="-i 2
  -t /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature 70
  -a /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state
  -p 10 25
  -m 600000 -M 1600000"

After making changes, you can restart CPUspeed with /etc/init.d/cpuspeed
restart (Fedora Core example).
Type /usr/sbin/cpuspeed -h for details and more options.
You can type cat /proc/cpuinfo to consult the current processor speed. That's
useful to check that the processor speed is scaled according to your settings.

1.4. Useful Resources for Power Management


* hdparm - hdparm is a Linux IDE disk utility that lets you set spin-down
  timeouts and other disk parameters. It works also for some SCSI features.
* Laptop_Mode - A feature implemented in the Linux kernel since the 2.6.6
  version. The idea is to spin up the hard disk only when reading uncached
  data, to delay and group disk writes, in order to reduce hard disk power
  consumption and save battery life. Control scripts are shipped by default by
  recent distributions.
  Laptop Mode may not be activated by default by distributions, as it is not
  recommended for servers and laptops running on AC power, because of the risk
  to loose data in a crash or sudden power off.
* Dynamic_Tick is available since kernel 2.6.21 and later. When enabled, this
  kernel feature allows to disable the CPU timer interrupts when all processors
  are idle. This way, idle systems are not woken up every 4 ms (default setting
  in Linux 2.6) just to realize there is nothing to do! This can save a little
  bit of power in notebooks (and CPU cycles in virtual hosting servers).
  Regular timer interrupts are re-enabled when something really happens, when a
  real hardware interrupt is received. In kernel configuration, this feature
  can be selected from the Kernel Features section (NO_IDLE_HZ setting). You
  can verify whether it is enabled with cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep
  CONFIG_NO_HZ.
* Mobile_Update_Daemon is a drop-in replacement for the standard update daemon,
  mobile-update minimizes disk spin ups and reduces disk uptime. It flushes
  buffers only when other disk activity is present. To ensure a consistent file
  system call sync manually. Otherwise files may be lost on power failure.
  mobile-update does not use APM. So it works also on older systems.
* The noatime and nodiratime mount options can be used to reduce disk writings.
  In operating systems like Linux which comply with the POSIX standard,
  filesystems are supposed to record the last time files are read. With default
  kernel settings, even if files are read from the file cache in RAM, this
  causes time data to be written to disk every 5 seconds. You may use a line
  like this /dev/hda3 /data ext3 defaults,noatime,nodiratime, 1 2 for example
  in /etc/fstab.
  To avoid this and reduce disk activity, you can add the noatime mount option
  to lines in the /etc/fstab file.
  This option doesn't have any known or significant impact on regular programs,
  except perhaps for backup / archiving software for which file access time
  information is useful.
* Toshiba_Linux_Utilities - This is a set of Linux utilities for controlling
  the fan, supervisor passwords, and hot key functions of Toshiba Pentium
  notebooks. There is a KDE package Klibreta, too.
* LCDproc - "LCDproc is a small piece of software that will enable your Linux
  box to display live system information on a LCD display. It supports a lot of
  serial and parallel LCDs.
* Dial_Daemon - The Diald daemon provides on demand Internet connectivity using
  the SLIP or PPP protocols. Diald can automatically dial in to a remote host
  when needed or bring down dial-up connections that are inactive.
* Getting your computer to use the least amount of power can be problematic.
  Intel's http://www.linuxpowertop.org/ project provides information on
  reducing power usage, tips, and tricks for Intel-based computers running
  Linux. As a first step, Intel has released PowerTOP, a tool that helps you
  find what software is using the most power. By fixing (or closing) these
  applications or processes, you can immediately see the power savings in the
  tool. You'll also see the estimated time left for battery power if you are
  running a laptop. The Tips & Tricks page has fixes for a lot of the issues
  that are already found.


1.5. Restoring your Work after Shutdown

Even if you don't use hibernate or suspend and switch off your system in a
standard way, you still have ways of saving time getting back to your work.
Modern graphical environments (KDE or Gnome) restart the applications that were
open when you logged out. However, most applications just get back to their
initial state and you will probably need to open your files again.
For people who do not want to loose the HTML pages they were browsing, the
Mozilla_Firefox_browser as a nice Bookmark All Tabs... command in the Bookmarks
menu. This is very convenient to restore a set of tabs or just to start your
browser with all your favorite information sites when you arrive in the
morning. Firefox v3 can save the current state of the browser and will restore
it upon powerup.
So, unless your computer is really computing something, you have less excuses
for keeping it on!

2. Power Management Unit - PMU (Apple PowerBook)

PowerBooks don't support the APM specification, but they have a separate
protocol for their PMU (Power Management Unit). There is a free (GPL) daemon
called pmud that handles power management; it can monitor the battery level,
put the machine to sleep, and set different levels of power consumption. It was
written by Stephan Leemburg <stephan at jvc.nl>, and is available from PPC
distribution FTP sites. There is also an older utility called snooze available
from the same sites that just puts the PowerBook to sleep.

3. Turn Monitor off, use Keyboard LEDs

There are some tools which allow to get information from your computer without
using the monitor:

* bl : Blink Keyboard LEDs
* blinkd : "Blinks keyboard LEDs for an answering machine or fax machine.
  Blinkd is a client/server pair, that lets the keyboard LEDs blink, indicating
  things like the number of incoming voice calls in the voice box or incoming
  faxes in the spool."
* mailleds : Shows new mails with the keyboard LEDs, mailleds is a quiet,
  unobtrusive way to signify that you have new mail: a user daemon to blink
  LEDs when there is new mail.
* tleds : Blinks keyboard LEDs indicating TX and RX network packets. They blink
  Scroll-Lock LED when a network packet leaves the machine, and Num-Lock LED
  when one is received.
* ledcontrol: is a program that allows you to show different information on the
  normally-unused LEDs on your keyboard. You can configure it to show virtually
  any true/false condition accessible or indicate an arbitrary number. The
  monitoring is by default done by shell scripts to allow for maximal
  configurability.


4. Screensavers


4.1. Screensaver Programs

Do they only prevent the screen from being burned in or do they save power,
too?
Some recommendations from Wade Hampton: Screensavers usually display graphics,
look for ETI, or perform other tasks. When using your screensaver in this
manner, you may actually consume MORE power. For example a computer using XSETI
as a screensaver might get far warmer (hence use more power) than when it was
being used to edit a document or perform a compile.
Some screen saver programs:

* The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen when
  it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended monitors
  should always be doing something interesting, just like they do in the
  movies. The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock
  and xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
  installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
  mode, you just change some resource settings. Any program which can be
  invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can now
  be used as a screensaver without modification. The programs that are being
  run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge about what it
  means to be a screensaver.
* LockVC is a console-locking-program combined with a starfield screensaver.
  Executing LOCKVC on a virtual console brings up a starfield that starts to
  rotate around all three axes.


4.2. Display Power Control

To really save power, and if your X server plus monitor supports it, use the
dpms option of xset (see the manual page for xset). For example, to enable the
DPMS (Energy Star) features of you X server: xset +dpms
You may also manually change the mode of your X display:

  xset dpms force standby
  xset dpms force suspend
  xset dpms force off

Note that suspend and off usually save much more energy than just standby,
especially in CRT displays.
According to manufacturers, switching off LCD displays more often doesn't
reduce their lifetime. As user can easily notice, there is no significant
penalty either between suspend and off modes in terms of switching on time.
In modern graphical desktop environments (like Gnome and KDE), it is easy to
configure automatic display switch off after a given inactivity timeout:

* KDE display power management: configure it in Control Center -> Peripherals -
  > Display -> Power Control.
* Gnome display power management: configure it in Desktop -> Preferences -
  > Screensaver -> AdvancedControl Center -> Peripherals -> Display -> Power
  Control.

AFAIK a CRT consumes on the order of 25 percent more power when displaying a
plain white screen than displaying a plain black screen. So, a screensaver
that's mostly black can help save power, even if it doesn't actually use DPMS
to power down the screen. Of course, one that's very bright and colourful, or
that keeps the CPU running fast is not much help.

5. Virtual Servers: Consolidation and Virtualization

On enterprise networks, or on the Internet, security constraints may require
that different services are run on different, isolated servers. The problem
with this one server per service approach is that most spend a lot of idle time
waiting for some rare activity bursts.
Several technologies now make it possible to run several GNU/Linux servers
inside a real, physical GNU/Linux server. As in physical servers, each virtual
server is isolated from the others. So, this approach retains the benefits of
separate servers, but makes it possible to share some hardware resources like
the CPU and network bandwidth. On the other hand, each virtual server enjoys a
reserved amount of RAM and disk space.
The benefits of virtual servers are obvious in terms of cost, power
consumption, optimum use of hardware resources, and consumption of computer
materials. There is another key advantage for hardware maintenance: virtuals
servers can very easily and transparently be migrated from one physical server
to another.
Virtualization solutions:

* User_Mode_Linux - The original solution. Allows to run one or several Linux
  kernel executables on a Linux machine (with a standard kernel) as regular
  programs.
* Xen - An increasingly popular alternative, with very little performance
  overhead. Also allows live server migration to other hardware. Requires a
  patched Linux kernel.

Virtuals servers all already very popular solutions for website hosting, but
virtualization still has a very strong potential in corporate networks.

6. Energy Star Label

Robert Horn <rjh at world.std.com> wrote: "
I had a chance to discuss Energy Star with the designers of desktop printers.
They confirmed that the allowable stand-by power targets depend on the device,
and they only knew their targets. But they made some other interesting
comments:

* Energy Star ratings lead to significant operational power savings. Timer
  based power savings are the exception. Most savings come from designing in
  power on demand with low leakage drivers. For example, using stepper motors
  with low leakage current instead of high leakage.
  This savings is both from individual designs and from the resulting demand
  for low leakage products causing better and cheaper low leakage product
  designs. The old-style (e.g. typewriter) design with one motor (always on)
  and various clutches is no longer the least cost.
* Energy Star was good organizational engineering. It never required designers
  to compromise quality or performance, which made it much harder to argue
  against design changes to reduce power consumption while idle. Since most of
  the savings begin the millisecond that parts stop moving, these savings are
  considerable.
* The power ratings on PC's are a safety rating, not a usage rating. So the
  235W and 300W power supplies that commonly found in PCs are specifying their
  safety limits. Actual full power usage is much less, typically 20-30 percent
  of the safe limit. The designers also noted that it is actually difficult to
  measure the power consumption of a switching power supply. You need to use
  specially designed power meters. The regular AC meters are designed for
  motors, and are rather inaccurate for switching power supplies.


7. Using Spare CPU Cycles

Some Linux applications use idle time in computers to cure diseases, study
global warming, or any other scientific research. They run as a low-priority
process (nice 20), so you can work without noticing that it's doing its task.
Another use is for people who use P2P software and leave the PC turned on for
long hours unattended, all that time the PC can be using the electricity it is
consuming for a practical purpose:

* BOINC
* Distributed.net


8. Miscellaneous Power Saving Techniques

Linux halts the CPU in the idle cycle to further reduce power consumption.
Early reports of OS/2, Win3.1/95, NT, and Linux showed Linux to use far less
power than DOS-based O/S's that spun in the idle loop and consumed power -
- this may have changed hence it would need research to validate.
Most Linux-users tend to leave their computer on for years whenever possible.
However, several modern BIOS's support an unattended powerup, and with cron you
can even do an unattended shutdown. No need to leave the computer on night
after night. Other techniques to powerup your computer at certain times are:
ACPI-Wakeup, NVRAM-wakeup and the settime command. Computers can even be power
up on request remotely by means of Wake-on-LAN using a network connection or
Wake-on-Ring using an old fashioned serial interface and a modem.
Beware of animated web pages! Web pages containing Flash, Java, or just
animated images can consume a lot of CPU. When you leave your computer and keep
it on, make sure you close all browser pages with animations. Otherwise, your
PC may be left running at full speed while you are not using it.
To disable animated images in Mozilla Firefox go to about:config, find
image.animation_mode and change its value to none or once.
Do not forget to switch off your DSL modem / wireless router / ISP box /
printers at night or during vacations if you don't use them. These devices
consume quite a lot (typically 15W).

Chapter 3. Noise Reduction

Table of Contents


  1._Fan

  2._Harddisk

  3._Speakers

Most of the noise emitted by a computer is produced by the fan, the harddisk
and the speakers.

1. Fan


* libsensors0 is a library to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors
* lm-sensors: "Kernel drivers to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors. This is
  a module for reading the temperature/voltage/fan sensors in Linux via the
  LM78/79 chip and possibly sensors on the SMBus (System Management Bus,
  usually found in P6 and P-II systems). The LM80 and a LM78-clone called
  W83781D are also supported."
* ACPI, see APM chapter
* RTSensors can be configured by the user as an expert controller: The user can
  specify the max/min speed of the system fans, the maximum affordable
  temperature and so on. The controller tries to reduce fan speed to reduce
  noise while the temperature is in a safe range chosen by the user. So fan
  speed is modified automatically by the control algorithm, you don't have to
  use those mechanic or thermal regulators on your fans anymore.


2. Harddisk

To avoid unneccessary hard disk noise you may use the same techniques as
described in the power saving chapter. Hard disks in most laptops are the
primary source of noise. Modern laptop and notebook hard drives come with a so-
called "Acoustic Management", just have a look into the manual to get an
overview about the possible settings.
The noise of the hard disk can be very disturbing, see man hdparm to reduce the
spin of the disk.
Some hard disk manufacturers offer dedicated tools, e.g. Hitachi's Feature_Tool
allows to change the drive Automatic Acoustic Management settings to the Lowest
acoustic emanation setting (Quiet Seek Mode), or Maximum performance level
(Normal Seek Mode).

3. Speakers

For the console setterm -blength 0 and for X xset b off turns the bell off. See
also PCMCIA-HOWTO, and much more details in the Visible-Bell-mini-Howto by

1. Printing of Drafts / Multiple Pages on One Sheet of Paper

Use psutils package to put more than one page on one sheet of paper. This
collection of utilities is for manipulating PostScript documents. Page
selection and rearrangement are supported, including arrangement into
signatures for booklet printing, and page merging for n-up printing.
For example, to create a PostScript document with 4 pages per sheet:
psnup -nup 4 doc.ps > doc4p.ps
Often HTML pages are not optimised for printing. You may use html2ps, a HTML to
PostScript converter, to print HTML pages. "This program converts HTML directly
to PostScript. The HTML code can be retrieved from one or more URLs or local
files, specified as parameters on the command line. A comprehensive level of
HTML is supported, including inline images, CSS1, and some features of HTML
4.0."
Or you may use mpage to print 2 up or 4 up (PS documents or ASCII text). This
may be used to save up to 50 percent or more of your paper.

2. Double Sided Printing

One important way to save paper is to print on both sides of the paper.
Depending on the printer capabilities, this can either be done manually
(printing odd and even pages in 2 passes), or by instructing the printer to use
both sides.

2.1. Printer control

If your GNU/Linux distribution is using the CUPS printing system (as most do
nowadays), you can configure double sided printing through the CUPS
administration interface. Open the http://localhost:631 URL with a browser,
type your root password if required, and configure any local printier
supporting double sided printing. This applies by default to all future print
jobs.
Print settings can also be changed on a job by job basis too. In particular,
KDE and Gnome let applications select and configure printers for each print
job.
If you are printing from the command line, you can use the lpr-wrapper to
insert printer control instructions to PostScript files at print time. Example:
lpr-wrapper -od doc.ps

2.2. Manual printing

If double sided printing is not supported by your printer, you can also achieve
this by printing odd/even (or right/left) pages separately. Many graphical
applications like OpenOffice.org let you do that.
If you print from the command line, you can also do this with mpage. From the
manual page:
-jfirst[-last][%interval]
Print just the selected sheets, specified by number, starting at 1. Here last
defaults to the end of data, interval to 1. Thus -j1-10 selects the first 10
sheets, while -j 1%2 prints just the odd- numbered sheets and -j 2%2 prints
just the even ones.
You can do double-sided printing, in two passes, as follows. If you use 3-hole
punched paper, put it in the printer such that the holes will appear at the top
of the page -- on the right as you pull out the printer tray, in our Laser
writer II NTX. Print the odd-numbered sheets with
-j 1%2 ...
Note the number of pages it reports. (Only half this many will really be
printed). When printing finishes, if mpage reported an odd number of pages,
remove the last one from the stack, since there will be no even-numbered sheet
to match it. Then arrange the stack of paper for printing on the other side.
(If it's punched, the holes will now be on the left.) On our II NTX, the paper
comes out blank-side up; replace it in the tray still blank-side up but rotated
180 degrees. For other printers, you figure it out. Now print the even-
numbered sheets in reverse order with
-r -j 2%2 ...
Hoping no one else reaches the printer before you do.
Duplex is a set of sh scripts that emulates duplex printing (on both sides of
the paper) for sheet-fed printers that do not support duplex printing in
hardware. It is intended for use on printers connected to workstations. It can
operate as a pipe so that applications can use it as a duplex printing driver.
Its unique feature is its ability to print to print many duplex print jobs in
one batch, printing the odd sides of all jobs and then the even sides in just
two passes.

3. Reading From the Monitor Instead From Paper

Or use less/xless/gless as a viewer instead of printing. You can view
PostScript documents with gs and view PDF documents with either xpdf or
acroread (from Adobe). Ask yourself, do you --really-- need a hardcopy each
time you decide to print something out.
For your own documents, a good idea is to create them in landscape mode, making
them easier to read without having to scroll up and down. Otherwise, readers
may find reading from the screen inconvenient and may then prefer printing. See
PDF editions of the free Tux_Magazine for a nice examples.
What are the reasons why people don't read from the monitor:

* Reading is slower up to 30 percent, see Jakob_Nielsen:_In_Defense_of_Print.
  The speed can be improved by better hardware (e.g. TFT display, greater
  screen, though this is against the other below to take smaller CRTs) and
  better display software and fonts (type-1, t1lib, truetype, freetype).
* Paper seems better organizable and more secure to some people. I suppose this
  can be treated by better software (e.g. Linux) and hardware, too.

Some people use handheld PC (e.g. PalmIII, Newton Message Pad, Psion 5) to
carry around documents to read rather than printing them out. At TuxMobil you
may get information about Linux_compatibility_for_handheld_PCs_and_PDAs. Or
they take eBook readers to read "Electronic Paper". At TuxMobil there is a
section about Linux_compatibility_for_eBook_readers, too.

4. Other Techniques

Another means of saving paper is through the use of comments and redline/
strikeout markings when exchanging a document with a co-worker/colaborator. For
example, a draft could be written using WordPerfect, then E-MAILed to a co-
worker. They could update the draft and send it back to you. You can use
WordPerfect's redline/strikeout features to see the changes. The document need
not be printed until it is "final" or in "final draft" status.
Question: Can you use the back side of paper in a laser printer? I have not had
much luck. You can use the paper that has been in a laser printer in an inkjet
printer by using the other side.
You should purchase smaller computers and monitors when possible. This will
save packaging material translating into less solid waste. For example the box
for a 15" CRT monitor is 2-3 times the size of the box for a 15" LCD monitor.
Linux works well with 15" LCD monitors on smaller computers like the Netwinder
or E3000 .
Tough smaller monitors may have another ecological caveat: because it's
inconvenient to browse to longer documents, people may tend to print the
documents instead of reading them from the screen.
Some have expressed the concern that LCD displays may use more toxic materials
and manufacturing processes than CRT displays, hence their usage actually may
be worse on the environment. The original information above concerned the solid
waste issue, which is fairly tangible and hence more controllable.
Does anyone know of studies or additional research to help clarify and resolve
this issue?
Recycle your used paper, ink, and packing materials.
You may use refillable printer cartridges. In Germany the are marked with the
Blauer Engel label.
Laser printer cartridges can often be used much more longer if you shake them
when the message toner low appears at the message panel.

* LaTeX documents: Using \usepackage{ccfonts} replaces the usual fonts by ones
  with wider lines and bolder serifes, improving readability at low
  resolutions. They are darker (i.e. use more ink) than the CM fonts and not as
  beautiful, so I would not recommend them for normal-size printings.
* Size-Reduction: Instead of psnup or other parts of the pstools check for
  enhanced Perl rewritings of psnup.
  It has a lot of options, which allow to set all 4 margins and the inner
  gutter separately. Since reduced documents are not very pretty anyway, this
  can be used to reduce the margin, leaving more place for the text. This
  probably requires some experimenting (trying new values over and over,
  checking the result with ghostview).
  The normally used options are:

  o -p2 (or -p4 etc., like -2 in the old psnup)
  o -NIH (don't decorate)
  o -l10 -r20 -b30 -t40 (add to margins)
  o -g50 (add to gutter)

  (these values vary depending on the papersize and the margins of the
  original, negative values are allowed).
* PDFjam is a small collection of shell scripts that provide a simple interface
  to some of the functionality of the pdfpages package for pdfLaTeX. At
  present, the utilities available are pdfnup, pdfjoin, and pdf90. PDFjam
  depends on a working installation of (pdf)LaTeX. pdfnup puts multiple
  document pages together on one physical page at a reduced size. pdfjoin
  concatenates multiple PDF documents. pdf90 rotates the pages of PDF
  documents. For Mac OS X, some example applications (droplets) are provided
  for drag-and-drop access to the scripts.
* Different ink printers are more or less capable to print on the backside of
  already used paper sheets. That's particularly useful to reuse all single
  sided paper sheets you receive for free every week! Try different
  manufacturers. Older Canon ink printers offer 360 dpi, older HP ink printers
  300 dpi. The readability of 4 pages/sheet using LaTex 10pt lies in between
  this features.
* Non-Linux: If you have to work with MS-Windows you should get the original
  Adobe-PostScript-Driver, instead of using the ones from MS-Windows. These
  drivers offer more than one page per paper sheet. AFAIK both psnup programs
  don't work with Adobe-PS, MS-Windows-PS and the PostScript extracted from MS-
  Windows-PDF files. The Computer-Modern-Fonts (without German diacritical
  characters) are available as TTF fonts on the CTAN servers. With these fonts
  you may enhance the aesthetical value of documents and save some paper space,
  too.
* Ghostscript has a new output format pswrite, which creates output in correct
  PostScript. This feature can be used to repair broken PostScript e.g. from
  Microsoft drivers, allowing their postprocessing with psnup etc.
* impose+ is a set of PostScript utilities. The main program is impose, which
  is used for two-up printing of DSC-compliant PostScript (including that from
  Netscape, dvips, and FrameMaker). It makes an effort to remove white space
  from the printout by probing the original PostScript for the bounding box of
  the printed area. This makes the output much more esthetic than does a
  simplistic layout of non-cropped original pages.
* hpgs is a printer driver that lets you to print on a HP 6xx Series printer
  using economic mode. It relies on the printer driver included in GhostScript
  to do everything but put the printer into economic mode.
* Besides command line tools for sophisticated printing there are also usefull
  GUI applications available. KPrinter opens automatically when you click on
  the "Print" icon of any KDE application. Choose your print job settings by
  going through the dialog and the click on the "Print" button. kprinter is a
  very versatile tool. Depending on the actual features and power of the print
  subsystem of your com- puter, kprinter translates the former's abilities into
  a nice and easy-to-understand GUI e.g. if your print subsystem does not
  support duplexing, kprinter will not show the option.
* gnome-manual-duplex is a utility that adds manual duplex to the "Print" menu.
* ecofont is an open source sans serif font with holes added to save printer
  ink.
* If you need to print a lot of Web pages from inside your FireFox webbrowser,
  the Nuke_Anything_Enhanced extension will help you to save some ink and
  paper. Once installed, it adds a "Remove this object" option to the right-
  click context menu. Place your mouse over information you don't need printed
  (menu bars, big graphical logos and so on) and use "Remove this object" to
  zap them temporarily. Clean up the page, then print just what you need.

Wade Hampton provided the biggest part of this chapter. Some suggestions are
from Ralf Muschall.


Chapter 5. Ecological Behaviour is Convenient

The psutils may not only save paper, they are also a great tool to produce a
convenient page design. Imagine a nice bounded manual in A5 format, against a
losely hefted block of A4 sheets.
Depending on wordlength and paragraphlength a multi-column layout sometimes
saves paper space (though the likelihood for a word to be broken increases, on
the other hand the space used by incomplete lines at the end of paragraphs
decreases). This doesn't save very much paper, but may fit 2.1 pages in 2.0,
therefore with the use of psnup it may fit on one page. Also multicolumn layout
is better readable.
psdim is a small utility to be used in conjunction with pstops. It looks at the
contents of a postscript document to determine the size of the printed pages.
From this, it calculates the optimal placement of the pages for n-up printing.
It outputs a format string suitable for processing by pstops.
Thanks to Ralf Muschall for his suggestions.


Chapter 6. Recycling of Consumables (Paper, Printer Cartridges, CD, Floppies,
Tapes)

All of these consumables are recycleable. I have put a list of URLs into
appendix H. You may start this process by separating different kinds of
"waste". There should be included some words on the difficulties of recycling
(data security, motivation, costs, ...).


Chapter 7. Reduction of Radiation, Electro Magnetic Fields, Heat


* monitors are a source of radiation and electro magnetic fields. They may be
  reduced by lead filters, LCD displays. Some eco labels like TCO95 include
  maximum levels of radiation, etc.
* especially larger number of PCs or can heat a room very much therefore it
  might be necessary to cool the room. This ca be reduced by using standby
  (powerdown) techniques.

1. Recycling of Hardware

The commercial computer market is largely driven by vendors seeking to sell new
hardware and software. There is no commercial marketing benefit in promoting
reuse.
Hence Linux doesn't require big hardware, it's very useful if you like or need
to use old and small hardware.

1.1. Supported CPU Families

Linux runs on Intel-compatible processors (starting from the 386) and
compatible processors by AMD, Cyrix and others. It also supports a long list of
32 and 64 bit processors. The whole list can be found in the arch_directory_in
the_Linux_kernel_sources.
The ARM architecture is a fast AND low-power alternative, used in a great
number of embedded systems (Linux and others). See the ARM_Linux_Project for a
wealth of Linux resources for ARM.
Linux is also supported on small, cheap and low power processors with no Memory
Management Unit (MMU), provided they are 32 bit ones. See the uClinux project
for details.
Mainstream Linux requires at least a 32 bit processor and doesn't support any
16 bit ones and will never do. However, there are separate efforts from the
ELKS project to reuse Linux code for the 286 CPU family.
On platforms supported by Linux, or even on some 16 bit processors, you may
also use the eCos operating system. This is another free, POSIX compatible
operating system targeting very small devices (possibly with real-time
requirements).
If you like, you may use Minix, one of the predecessors of Linux. Minix
supports 8088 to 286 with as little as 640K memory.

1.2. Linux Applications for Old Computers


1.2.1. RULE

Hardware is only as old as the software it runs. RULE wants to make modern Free
Software useable even on 5 or more years old machines, on which current Linux
distributions won't install or run too slowly.

1.2.2. ISDN Router

ISDN_Router allows you to convert old hardware into a secure masquerading ISDN
router, including caching nameserver, IP Port Forwarding, and on-demand channel
bundling. The system fits onto a single disk, and users can change the
configuration through a simple menu-based system (on the console or over
telnet) and store it permanently on the disk.

1.2.3. Linux LiveCD Router

Linux_LiveCD_Router allows you to share and firewall your broadband connection
and use WiFi. It works with DSL, cable modem, T1, and dial-up connections and
supports inexpensive hardware such as USB and PCMCIA WiFi and ethernet cards.
Hardware requirements: One dedicated computer with the following minimum
specifications: 486 Processor, 16 MBytes of RAM, 2X CDRom reader, floppy drive,
1 or 2 ethernet cards. NO hard disk! Optionally a WIFI card.

1.2.4. FreeS/WAN

Linux_FreeS/WAN provides IPSEC (IP Security, which is both encryption and
authentication) kernel extensions and an IKE (Internet Key Exchange, keying and
encrypted routing daemon) as well as various rc scripts and documentation. This
lets a bright Linux sysadmin build VPN's gateways out of even old 584 and 486
PC Clone boxes. The 1.00 version is known to inter-operate with other IPSEC and
IKE system already deployed by other vendors such as OpenBSD.

1.2.5. Print Server

A common use for an old computer is running a print server on it.

1.3. Small Linux Distributions for Old Computers


* Damn_Small_Linux - A full featured Live-CD distribution derived from Knoppix,
  with a very active community. It fits within 50 MB and runs fine on a 486 PC
  with 16 MB of RAM. Included software: Firefox, xmms, xpdf, Sylpheed, FluxBox
  WM, Siag, spreadsheet, Ted word processor... Used a lot on USB flashdisks
  too.
* Basic_Linux - The lightest distro for old PCs! It just needs 3 MB of RAM and
  6 MB of disk. Features: X graphics, window manager, clock, calculator, text
  based e-mail reader, browser (links), presentations (MagicPoint), network
  dial-up... Great for using an old PC as an X terminal!
* Puppy_Linux Fast and light distribution. Works great on 10 year old
  computers. Actively developed.
* DeLi_Linux - A Linux distribution for old computers, from 486 to Pentium MMX
  166 or so. It's focused on desktop usage. It includes email clients, a
  graphical Web browser, an office package with word processor and spreadsheet,
  etc. A full install, including XFree86 and development tools, needs no more
  than 300 MB of harddisk space.
* Small_Linux_2 - A distribution which is designed to run on old / low-spec PC
  computers (386 and 2-3 mb of ram). It consists of two floppy discs
  one,containing the kernel and the other the root system. Built upon uClibc
  and Busybox.
* MEPISLite - Debian based distribution targeting PCs that used to run Windows
  98 (typically 128 MB of RAM, 2 GB of disk space and a 500 MHZ CPU).
* Using Gentoo on Old Machines
  "Old computers don't have to run old software. Old software does not have
  it's bugs covered and is bad for security.
  Most modern distros will be very sluggish when run on those machines; not
  because they use new software, but because they expect to be run on new
  machines and may automatically install large amounts of software. The thrust
  of Gentoo-on-old-hardware is to obtain a light, minimalist system that runs
  what you need it to and no more; unlike many proprietary OSes and the
  "heavier" distros such as Fedora, Gentoo starts very light by default."
* Minix - Not a Linux but a UNIX useful for small systems. Minimum
  requirements: 386 CPU, 8 MB of RAM, 50 MB of disk space.

See Wikipedia for a_longer_list_of_small_Linux_distributions.

1.4. Dealing with Limited Resources or Tuning the System

This chapter is taken from my Linux-Mobile-Guide_-_A_Guide_for_Laptops,_PDAs
and_Mobile_Phones.

1.4.1. Related HOWTOs


* Small-Memory-HOWTO Describes how to run Linux on a system with a small amount
  of memory.


1.4.2. Introduction

To deal with limited space, memory, CPU speed and battery power, I have written
this chapter.

1.4.3. Small Space


1.4.3.1. Introduction

There are different types of techniques to gain more disk space, such as
sharing of space, freeing unused or redundant space, filesystem tuning and
compression. Note: some of these techniques use memory instead of space. As you
will see, there are many small steps necessary to free some space.

1.4.3.2. Techniques


* Stripping: Though many distributions come with stripped binaries today it is
  useful to check this. For details see man strip. To find every unstripped
  file you can use the file command or more convenient the tool findstrip (find
  it in the Debian perforate package) . Attention: don't strip libraries,
  sometimes the wrong symbols are removed due to a bad programming technique.
  A recommendation from Russell Marks <rus at beeb.net>:
  These days a lot of people compile with -g, which I find a bit annoying
  (though AFAIK this only loses you disk space, in practice).
  strip has a --strip-debug option which doesn't strip symbols, but does still
  get rid of the debugging stuff. This is almost as good, in many cases, and
  it's ok to use it on libraries. As it happens, I recently got SuSE 6.3, so I
  can give you a live example:

    bash-2.03# cd /lib
    bash-2.03# ls -l libc.so.6
    -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      4223971 Nov  6 16:22 libc.so.6
    bash-2.03# strip --strip-debug libc.so.6
    bash-2.03# ls -l libc.so.6
    -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1200355 Dec  8 00:13 libc.so.6

* Sparse files: in the case when files contain blocks with only null
  characters, these blocks can be replaced by lseek command calls, saving
  space. Applications (and not the operating system) are responsible for
  creating or handling such files in a correct way. For example, both the tar
  and cp commands have options for handling sparse files in a correct way. See
  the this_page for more details and for a sparse command to create such files.
  In Debian, you can also use the zum command from the perforate package.
* Remove Odd Files and Duplicates: Check your system for core files, emacs
  recovery files <#FILE#> vi recovery files <FILE>.swp, RPM recovery files
  <FILE>.rpmorig and patch recovery files. Find duplicates, you may try
  finddup. Choose a system to name your backup, temporary and test files, e.g.
  with a signature at the end.
* Clean Temporary Files: , e.g. /tmp, there is even a tool tmpwatch.
* Shorten the Log Files: usually the files in /var/log. There are some nice
  helpers for this task around, e.g. savelog .
* Remove Files: Remove files which are not "necessary" under all circumstances
  such as man pages, documentation /usr/doc and sources e.g. /usr/src .
* Unnecessary Libraries: You may use the binstats package to find unused
  libraries (Thanks to Tom Ed White).
* Filesystem: Choose a filesystem which treats disk space economically e.g.
  rsfs aka Reiser Filesystem. Tune your filesystem e.g. tune2fs. Choose an
  appropriate partition and block size.
* Reduce Kernel Size: Either by using only the necessary kernel features and/or
  making a compressed kernel image bzImage.
* Compressed read-write filesystems:
  - There was a project to add compression support to ext2 filesystems:
  e2compr. This project has a very limited usefulness as it is currently
  inactive and only supports very old 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions. No chance to
  get a working patch on the latest 2.4 and 2.6 releases.
  - Fortunately, a very serious solution exists in the Reiser4_filesystem which
  includes a compression plugin. Using compression is even reported to be
  faster than not using it. Actual results should of course vary with the CPU
  and disk speed, and results might be disappointing on old machines.
* Compressed read-only filesystems
  - The idea is store parts of the system (typically executables and libraries
  through the /bin, /sbin and /usr directories) in a separate, compressed and
  read-only filesystem. This is great for saving space and for protecting the
  system from extern attacks. However, the constraint is that software upgrades
  can no longer be done when the filesystem is mounted. The whole filesystem
  contents must be rebuilt and replaced at once.
  - CramFS was the first implemented solution, used by many embedded system
  makers. Though still maintained, it is dramatically outperformed by SquashFS.
  - SquashFS is the solution everyone should use now. Unlike CramFS, it has no
  limitations on filesystem and file size, and it achieves much better
  compression and read speed (up to 5 times!). On slow storage (like USB flash
  drives), replacing ext2 with SquashFS resulting in a 50% reduction on system
  boot time (observed in a Linux demo developped by Free_Electrons).
* Partition Sharing: You may share swap-space (see Swap-Space-HOWTO) or data
  partitions between different OS (see mount).
* C library: use uClibc instead of the default GNU_C_library aka glibc. It
  takes approximately 400 KB instead of 1700 (glibc). It used by many embedded
  Linux projects as well as by several tiny Linux distributions. It should
  satisfy most needs, as the whole Debian 3.0 was ported to it. Caution: if you
  replace the C library, all applications also need to be recompiled with a
  dedicated gcc toolchain.
* Busybox - A toolbox implementing most Unix commands. It takes at most 500 KB
  instead of approximately 10-30 MB with GNU implementations! It is used by
  almost all embedded Linux projects and small Linux distros. Most commands are
  implemented, even vi, wget, a dhcp server and client, and even a http server
  sufficient for most needs. Even if some rare command options are not
  implemented, even an experienced Unix user hardly makes the difference with
  GNU commands!
* Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can save
  some space.
  However, with old kernels, you will miss cool features (such as real-time
  preemption, making your system much more responsive) and support for recent
  peripherals. It is true that the Linux kernel accumulated bloat over the
  years: more features, support for more special cases... Now that Linux is
  taking an increasingly dominant place in embedded systems, work is being done
  to control the kernel size. The LinuxTiny project releases a set of patches
  to the Linux kernel sources. In the Configure Standard Kernel Features for
  Small Systems kernel configuration section, you can unselect features you do
  not need in a simple computer. The minimum compressed size you can achieve
  for a Linux 2.6 kernel for a simple PC is approximately 350 KB. Note that
  more and more LinuxTiny changes are now available in the standard Linux
  kernel (no patching necessary).
  With the latest kernel releases, you may also try the real-time_preemption
  patches from Ingo Molnar. When full preemption is enabled, it adds
  unprecedented responsiveness to the Linux kernel. The latency is much
  reduced, suitable for real real-time systems (less than 100 us!). It is
  definitely worth trying on old systems to give them a new youth and improve
  the user experience!
* GUI: Avoid as much Graphical User Interface (GUI) as possible.
* Tiny Distributions: There are some distributions available which fit from one
  3.5" floppy to 10MB disk space and fit for small memories, too. See Laptop-
  HOWTO


1.4.4. Harddisk Speed

Use the tool hdparm to set up better harddisk performance. Though I have seen
laptop disk enabled with stripping, I can't see a reason to do so, because IMHO
aka RAID0 stripping needs at least to different disks to increase performance.

1.4.5. Small Memory


1.4.5.1. Related HOWTOs


* Small-Memory-mini-HOWTO by Todd Burgess
* 4MB_Laptop-HOWTO by Bruce Richardson.
* Linux_Loadable_Kernel_Module_HOWTOby Bryan Henderson.
* Kerneld-mini-HOWTO by Henrik Storner.


1.4.5.2. Techniques

Check the memory usage with free and top.
You may also reduce the kernel size as much as possible by removing any feature
which is not necessary for your needs and by modularizing the kernel as much as
possible.
Also you may shutdown every service or daemon which is not needed, e.g. lpd,
mountd, nfsd and close some virtual consoles. Please see the Small-Memory-mini-
HOWTO for details.
And of course use swap space, when possible.
If possible you may use the resources of another machine, for instance with X,
VNC or even telnet. For more information on Virtual Network Computing (VNC),
see VNC .

1.4.6. Low CPU Speed

You may want to overdrive the CPU speed but this can damage your hardware and I
don't have experience with it. For some examples look at Adorable_Toshiba
Libretto_-_Overclocking.

1.4.7. Tiny Applications and Distributions

A small collection yet, but I'm looking for more information.

* BOA - "Lightweight and High Performance WebServer. boa is a single-tasking
  HTTP server. That means that unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork
  for each incoming connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to
  handle multiple connections. It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing
  HTTP connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
  processes). Preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several hundred
  hits per second on a 100 MHz Pentium."
* Low Bandwidth X - Alan Cox in LINUX REDUX February 1998: " ... (Differential
  X_Protocol_Compressor_-_Dxpc) is the alternative most people prefer. These
  systems act as proxy X11 servers and compress datastreams by well over 50
  percent for normal requests, often reaching a reduction to 25 percent of the
  original bandwidth usage. With dxpc, X windows applications are quite usable
  over a 28.8 modem link or across the Internet."
* Blackbox - "This is a window manager for X. Ixt is similar in many respects
  to such popular packages as Window Maker, Enlightenment, and FVWM2. You might
  be interested in this package if you are tired of window managers that are a
  heavy drain on your system resources, but you still want an attractive and
  modern-looking interface."
* screen - Tiny but powerful console manager. John M. Fisk <fiskjm at
  ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu> in LINUX_GAZETTE : "It's a GUI, GUI, GUI, GUI world! "
  - or so the major OS manufacturers would have you belief. Truth is, that
  while this is increasingly the case, there are times when the command line
  interface (CLI) is still a very good choice for getting things done. It's
  fast, generally efficient, and is a good choice on memory or CPU constrained
  machines. And don't forget that there are still a lot of very nifty things
  that can be done at the console." "screen is a full-screen window manager
  that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically
  interactive shells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC
  VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI
  X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support
  for multiple character sets). Real multiuser support, split screen support,
  hardstatus emulation support, configurable window seperator and hardstatus
  strings, permanent window seperator, many new escapes, logfile timestamps and
  flush timeout, optional builtin telnet, optional Braille support, support for
  history compaction."
* tinyirc - "A tiny, stripped down IRC Client. Doesn't have most of the more
  advance commands in the ircII family of IRC Clients, nor does it have any
  color, but it works, and it's tiny."
* tinyproxy - "is a lightweight HTTP proxy designed to do the job with a
  minimum of system resource use. It's ideal for small networks where a larger
  HTTP proxy such as squid might be overkill or a security risk. This
  simplicity also makes tinyproxy an ideal candidate for customization - it
  takes very little time to read and understand the tinyproxy source, and thus
  you can start adding your own desired features on short order."

Actually, with the progress of Linux in embedded systems, countless lightweight
applications now exist. A_presentation_from_Free_Electrons tries to list the
most popular ones.

2. Other Techniques

NiCad batteries need to be discharged periodically to prevent the memory effect
and prolong their lifespan.
Batteries such as NiCad, Lead Acid, and NiMH contain TOXIC chemicals.
Techniques should be taken to prolong their lifespan, and when you do discard
them, they should be recycled, not thrown in the trash.
One technology to watch is the Iron_battery. Such a battery could reduce some
of the toxic waste problems associated with used batteries, however such a
battery is probably a few years away.
Some remarks about backlights in laptops, monitors (screensavers), harddisks
(hdparm), etc. have to be written.

3. Linux BadRAM Patch

The objective of the BadRAM_Patch is to run the Linux kernel in such a way that
it can handle defective RAM modules. With defective RAM, I mean RAM which has
some bits wrong at some (known) addresses. Normally, such RAM is considered
useless and thrown away; the larger RAMs get, the higher the chances of failing
addresses. With ever growing RAM sizes, it would therefore be pleasant to have
an alternative to discarding of defective RAM chips.

4. Installing Linux on Older Hardware

Lightweight_Linux,_Part_1: Hardware is only as old as the software it runs: a
modern operating system and up-to-date applications return an older system to
productivity. This article provides best practices and step-by-step guidance on
how to build a working Linux system on older hardware or on modern hardware
with limited memory and storage.
Purging of uneeded Locales: localepurge for Debian/GNU Linux is just a simple
script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded locale files and localized man
pages. Depending on your installation, it is possible to save some 20, 30, or
even more megabytes of disk space usually dedicated for locales you'll probably
never have any usage for.

5. Upgrading and Repairing Computer Hardware and Communication Devices

Usually manufacturers declare the warranty to be void if the case was opened by
people other than their own staff. If you want to try it anyway you may find
some interesting links about how to repair,_disassemble,_upgrade_or_mod_laptops
or_notebooks, repair_broken_PDAs_and_HandHelds, as well as repair_mobile_
(cellular)_phones, repair_portable_audio_and_video_players, repair,_clean_and
mod_a_computer_mouse, repair_printers,_ink_and_toner_cartridges, repair_hard
disk_drives, repair_and_clean_computer_keyboards and repair_and_mod_GPS
navigation_devices and repair_personal_computers_-_PCs.
BTW: here are some non-computer related links to guides explaining, how to
repair_(digital)_cameras, repair_cars.

6. Other Operating Systems

Courtesy of George White <gwhite at bodnext.bio.dfo.ca>: Or you can buy an
older computer (SGI, Sun, NeXT) that comes with unix and is capable of running
a wide range of open source software. In some cases (SGI Indigo2) you can still
run current OS versions, in others you may do better with an open source OS
such as Linux, but in either case you have access to lots of good software and
tools to write your own. The lower power consumption of older computers means
you get more reserve time from an UPS or can use a small alternative power
source if you don't have access to "mains" power.


Chapter 9. Using Linux on non-PC Hardware

Table of Contents


  1._Using_Consumer_Electronics_Devices

  2._Using_Embedded_Linux_Boards

As mentioned in the previous chapter, Linux can be run on non-PC architectures.
This is particularly useful for the small applications old PCs can be used for.
Recent netbooks either ARM-based or MIPS-based provide an even smaller power
footprint. Check moblin Linux, which is dedicated to such machines.

1. Using Consumer Electronics Devices

Linux is increasingly used in Consumer Electronics (CE) devices, in particular
in network appliances such as Wifi routers, DSL modems, Network Attached
Storage (NAS) servers, IP cameras and other small devices.
Thanks to the GNU GPL license, kernel and application source code for these
devices are freely available. More and more device owners are taking advantage
of this to develop other uses for these devices. Thanks to the progress of
Linux in embedded systems, making its own embedded system is increasingly easy.
Using such devices instead of regular PCs yields many advantages: much lower
power consumption, no noise (no fans), built with much fewer materials (small
size), and much lower cost (for your purse and for the environment).

* NSLU2-Linux - A community of people running Linux on the Linksys NSLU2
  device. This device is originally a Network Attached Storage server,
  featuring a 266 MHz ARM CPU, 8MB of flash, 32MB of SDRAM and a rich
  connectivity: Connectivity: USB (for attached storage), Ethernet and a serial
  port. That's all you need in a versatile Linux computer. Many different cool
  applications are listed by the project.
  The NSLU2 device is still available in the shops on all continents, for a
  very cheap price: approximately 90 € or 90 US Dollars. This makes this device
  extremely popular!
* OpenWRT - A project to run Linux on WiFi routers based on the Linksys WRT
  chipset. A typical configuration includes a 125 to 200 MHz ARM CPU, 4 MB of
  flash, 16 MB of RAM, and Ethernet, WiFi, serial port (often) and a USB host
  port (often).
  Devices based on the Linksys WRT chipset are available for sale on all
  continents, costing between 50 and 100 € / US Dollars. They are very popular
  too!

In a nutshell, do not buy a new PC for small applications. Reuse your old
computers or buy a consumer device on which you can run Linux!

2. Using Embedded Linux Boards

Instead of using a PC, or even instead reusing a consumer device, you may also
create your own system using dedicated embedded system boards. Because of lower
volumes, such boards may be a bit more expensive, but they can achieve much
reduced size and power consumption. Both low and higher volumes are available
too.
Here are a few noteworthy examples:

* Picotux - The smallest Linux computer in the world, only slighly larger than
  a RJ45 connector. Pretty cheap too.
* Gumstix - Small, affordable embedded boards with the size of a gumstick.
  Backed by an active community too.

See this independent_list_of_interesting_board_suppliers for more details.


Chapter 10. X10 - Home Automation System

"X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet and allow you to
remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that is plugged into them.
There are also X-10 modules that install in place of wall switches to control
lights, and there's one that can be used to set back a thermostat."
These X10 folks make a really cool dongle called the Firecracker. These allow
for the control of X10 devices via a serial-port of your PC. Programs like
Bottlerocket and GtkX10 allow Linux programs to control X10 devices using the
Firecracker device. You may be able to get the Firecracker, a remote control, a
receiver, and a lamp module for as little as $5.95 U.S. (special promotion).
GNU_Phantom.Home is a computer controlled home automation system. The software
includes a circuit diagram for building the Phantom.Home.Controller, a simple
circuit board that attaches to your PC's parallel port. Using the combination
of hardware/software you can control (i.e. flip on or off) nearly any 120V
device. And with a little bit of electronics know-how, you can probably control
nearly any device at any voltage by modifying the circuit board to meet your
needs. The simple circuit included can be created and built for around $25. The
modules cost around $10 (basically a heavy duty relay).
More details on this topic are available on the Linux_Home_Automation website.
Turn that light off when not in use!


Chapter 11. Uninterruptible Power Supply - UPS

You should use a protection against lightening and power surges or a UPS if you
have many thunderstorms in the area. That will save hardware, software, your
time, and money, and help prevent you from throwing out that old monitor, CPU,
or modem when it gets trashed by lightening. For details consult the UPS-HOWTO.
For desktop PCs, in areas prone to lightening or power outages, UPSs could save
hours of work each week, potentially translating into power savings. However,
there is some concern over their additional usage of AC power. If anyone has
any studies or research on this issue, could they please forward it to us? That
would be an interesting question to post to APC, BEST, etc.
UPSs also contain batteries with a high environmental cost. So, just use a UPS
when really needed and when benefits outweight environmental costs. For
example, if you are using a notebook, a much cheaper surge protection is enough
thanks to your battery.
People have also reported issues using unreliable power sources, for example in
trains. Make sure you use a surge protection device then!


Chapter 12. Games

Personally I'm not much a player of computer games but maybe they can be used
for environmental education. In a first investigation I found Lincity and Real
Life, please check their usefulness by yourself.

* Lincity - Build & maintain a city/country. You are required to build and
  maintain a city. You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for your
  residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help of renewable
  energy and recycling, or you can go for broke and build rockets to escape
  from a pollution ridden and resource starved planet, it's up to you. Due to
  the finite resources available in any one place, this is not a game that you
  can leave for long periods of time. This game is similar to the commercial
  simulation game with a similar name. This package provides files common to
  both the X and SVGALIB versions of the game.
* Real_Life - "In Conway's_Game_of_Life every cell is either fully alive (has
  the value of 1) or completely dead (has the value 0). In Real Life this
  restriction to bivalence is lifted to countenance -real-valued- degrees of
  life and death. Real Life contains Conway's Game of Life as a special case;
  however, Real Life, in contrast to Conway's Game of Life, exhibits sensitive
  dependence on initial conditions which is characteristic of chaotic systems."
* Sierra has produced (some time ago) Eco Quest 1 - Lost in Rainforest and Eco
  Quest 2 - The Search for Cetus. The EcoQuest games were for MS-DOS and
  Windows 3.x. These were targeted at younger players.
* SimEarth, 1988, Maxis (DOS, Win3.x, Mac) Simulates the development of a
  planet from the forming of the crust to the spread of civilization. Based on
  James Lovelock's Gaia theory. Somewhat dull and difficult to learn, but
  there's a good amount of educational value to be gotten out of fiddling
  around with the models, particularly greenhouse effect.
* Balance of the Planet, 1991, Chris Crawford (DOS, Mac): You take the role of
  a government policy-maker who must try to balance industry and ecology.
  Remarkably complicated and drab (even moreso than SimEarth), but certain to
  be educational and thought-provoking if time is spent with the manual. The
  Mac version can now be downloaded for free from Crawford's_website.
* Global Effect, 1992, Millennium (DOS, Amiga): An early real-time strategy
  game where you must try to conquer your opponent while dealing with the
  ecological ramifications of your weapons and industry upon your population.
  Clunky interface, not a lot of fun compared to current Warcraft-type games.
* SimIsle, 1995, Maxis (DOS, ???) Develop a tropical island without destroying
  the rainforest ecology. Large learning curve but supposedly a lot of fun.
* SimPark, 1997, Maxis (Win 95, ???) Sort of a children's version of SimIsle,
  which is simpler and more education-focused.

I suspect the older games should run just fine on dosemu.


Chapter 13. Ecology Software (Simulation, Data Collection, Statistics, etc.)

Table of Contents


  1._Ecolab

  2._Tierra

  3._Linux_in_Environmental_Research

  4._SWARM

  5._Climate-Dynamics

  6._UNCERT

  7._EcoTopia

  8._Digiqual

Though I know there is some MS-Windows based software which is used in
ecological science (there is even a branch environmental informatic), I know
only Ecolab available for Linux yet. But I guess Linux software (for instance
databases or statistics programs) may easily adopted. Also it might be possible
to use a Linux cluster to solve ecological simulations.

1. Ecolab

Ecolab is both the name of a software package and a research project that is
looking at the dynamics of evolution. EcoLab is a system that implements an
abstract ecology model. It is written as a set of Tcl/Tk commands so that the
model parameters can easily be changed on the fly by means of editing a script.
The model itself is written in C++.

2. Tierra

Tierra by Tom Ray is a tool for studying digital evolution and ecology that
runs on Linux and other OSes.

3. Linux in Environmental Research

Courtesy of Wade Hampton: Linux is ideally suited for use as a research tool
for environmental experiments. There are small embedded Linux solutions that
can be used for remote monitoring or telemetry. There are VERY small Linux
implementations from PC-104 systems to embedded systems like the uCsimm. Linux
even flew on the shuttle controlling biological experiments.... Linux has been
used for weather research on NOAA's Hurricane Hunter aircraft.
Linux is also an ideal platform for researching ecological and environmental
information via the Internet using standard WWW-based tools like Netscape.
Linux may even be used to model complex biological and environmental processes.
beowulf_clusters have been used to run complex simulations of environmental
processes, for example Earthdome, listed in the Beowulf_projects_page.

4. SWARM

SWARM is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex systems that
is being developed by the Swarm Development Group (SDG).
Swarm is intended to be a useful tool for researchers in a variety of
disciplines, especially artificial life. The basic architecture of Swarm is the
simulation of collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this
architecture, we can implement a large variety of agent based models. The
source code is freely available under GNU Licensing terms.

5. Climate-Dynamics

Linux clusters are used in climate modeling, for example in the University_of
Bern in Switzerland.

6. UNCERT

UNCERT is a geostatistical uncertainty analysis package applied to groundwater
flow and contaminant transport modeling. This package was developed for
evaluating the inherent uncertainty in describing subsurface geology, hydraulic
properties, and the migration of hazardous contaminants in groundwater flow
systems. It is well suited for the aforementioned purposes, but is also
sufficiently general to be usable by researchers in a wide range of disciples.

7. EcoTopia

The EcoTopia web site uses computer simulation to model Santa Cruz, California
as an ideal environmental community. For Ecotourists and Green Consumers,
EcoTopia strives to offer the nation a model of integration of technology and
environmental remediation using computer modeling and image forecasting.

8. Digiqual

Digiqual is a package to manage a quality and environmental control system for
a factory. The package consists of six modules, but only the first module has
been released. The modules are Supplier Evaluation, Non Conformity,
Documentation, Maintenance, and Internal Audit, and Training. All data are
stored in a PostgreSQL database by the psycopg connector.

  a mailing list yet. Please let me know of such projects, otherwise I will
  create a list a FreeLists.org .
* Repair_FAQ .
* CE_Linux_Forum is a non profit consortium of embedded system makers (such as
  Sony, Panasonic, Philips...) which works to develop the suitability of Linux
  as an operating system for Consumer Electronics (CE) devices. Its_Wiki is
  full of useful resources for embedded system makers to reduce size, power
  consumption, and to increase speed. You may find lots of interesting ideas
  and resources there. Free Electrons has a overview_presentation summarizing
  these ideas and resources.
* "The Electronic_Green_Journal, published by the University of Idaho Library,
  is a professional, refereed publication devoted to disseminating information
  concerning sources on international environmental topics including:
  assessment, conservation, development, disposal, education, hazards,
  pollution, resources, technology, and treatment. We are academically
  sponsored; our focus, however, is to publish articles, bibliographies,
  reviews, and announcements for the educated generalist as well as the
  specialist. We welcome original contributions from authors on any of the
  above topics." . You may also find a survey about Environmental Resources on
  the World Wide Web there.
* BAN is a global network of toxics and development activist organizations that
  share a vision of international environmental justice. We seek to prevent all
  forms of "toxic trade" -- in toxic wastes, toxic products and toxic
  technologies. BAN members will work nationally, regionally and globally to
  accomplish the following mission: The Basel_Action_Network_(BAN) works to
  prevent the globalization of the toxic chemical crisis. In particular, we
  seek to ensure that the Basel Convention and its ban (Decisions II/12 and
  III/1) on the export of hazardous wastes from OECD to non-OECD countries will
  not be weakened, but rather ratified and implemented at the earliest possible
  date. We also seek to ensure that the Basel Convention and other instruments
  and efforts, serve to prevent the trade and growth of the world's most
  hazardous, and often obsolete industries, particularly with respect to
  developing or newly industrializing countries.
* Silicon_Valley_Toxics_Coalition_(SVTC) is a diverse grassroots coalition that
  for almost twenty years has engaged in research, advocacy, and organizing
  associated with environmental and human health problems caused by the rapid
  growth of the high-tech electronics industry. Our goal in addressing these
  problems is to advance environmental sustainability and clean production in

1. Ecological Comparisons of Computers

Scientists of ReUse_project located at the Technical_University_of_Berlin
recently compared the energy consumption of different computer types along the
life cycle. The production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 %
less than 4 years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer
is used for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the stand-bye-mode still 100
Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80 Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60
Watt. Therefore from the ecological point of view it is better to buy an old
computer that didn't need the energy for a new production and which consumes
less electricity while it is being used.
LCD displays need less energy than other monitors. For this reason laptops are
the most ecological types of the compared computers. They need the smallest
amount of energy when they are used. And 3 year old laptops are better than new
ones since their processors need less energy than new examples. There is also
an article in the German computer magazine C't_21/_2003.

2. Battery

Has to be written. See Battery-Powered-mini-HOWTO , too.

3. PCMCIA Card Services and Advanced Power Management

Quoted from the PCMCIA-HOWTO: "Card Services can be compiled with support for
APM (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured your kernel with APM
support. ... The PCMCIA modules will automatically be configured for APM if a
compatible version is detected on your system. Whether or not APM is
configured, you can use cardctl suspend before suspending your laptop, and
cardctl resume after resuming, to cleanly shut down and restart your PCMCIA
cards. This will not work with a modem that is in use, because the serial
driver isn't able to save and restore the modem operating parameters. APM seems
to be unstable on some systems. If you experience trouble with APM and PCMCIA
on your system, try to narrow down the problem to one package or the other
before reporting a bug. Some drivers, notably the PCMCIA SCSI drivers, cannot
recover from a suspend/resume cycle. When using a PCMCIA SCSI card, always use
cardctl eject prior to suspending the system."
You should use the internal modem in a laptop instead of a PCMCIA modem, if
possible (it may be a WinModem).

4. Power Saving Techniques


* If you don't need infrared support, disable it in the BIOS or shutdown the
  IrDA device driver. There are also some IrDA features of the kernel which are
  useful for saving power. In the specifications of my HP OmniBook 800 it is
  recommended to turn off the IR port, if it is not in use, because it may
  consume up to 10 percent of the battery time. If necessary, you may also try
  to disable the Fast RRs feature in the IrDA section of the kernel. This
  option will give you much better latencies but will consume more power.
* PCMCIA services consume much power, so shut them down if you don't need them.
* I'm not sure to which extend the backlight consumes power. WARNING: AFAIK
  this device can only bear a limited number of uptime circles. So avoid using
  screensavers too much.
* For some examples to build batteries with increased uptime up to 8 hours look
  at Adorable_Toshiba_Libretto.
* For information about APM look at the APM chapter above.
* A_hacked_rclock. Booker C. Bense has hacked the rclock program to include a
  simple battery power meter on the clock face.
* KDE provides KAPM, Kbatmon and Kcmlaptop. Written by Paul Campbell kcmlaptop
  is a set of KDE control panels that implements laptop computer support
  functions, it includes a dockable battery status monitor for laptops - in
  short a little icon in the KDE status bar that shows how much battery time
  you have left. It also will warn you when power is getting low and allows you
  to configure power saving options. Similar packages you may find at the GNOME
  project . See the software maps at both sites.
* Please see Battery-Powered-mini-HOWTO for more information.
* toshiba-fan Turn the fan on a Toshiba Pentium laptop on or off. This is a
  command line utility to turn the fan of a Toshiba laptop on or off, or view
  its current state. It should work on all Toshiba Pentium laptops that have
  fans.



Appendix B. Appendix B - MP3-Hardware-Decoder at Parallel Port

In the German computer magazine CT issue 9/1999 p. 200 and 10/1999 p. 260 I
found an article about turning an old PC (from 286 upward) into a MP3 player,
by using a MP3-Hardware-Decoder at the parallel port. Authors_Homepage .
Also mentioned there, is a software by Klaus_Peichl, which doesn't need a
hardware decoder.
Though both programs are DOS based, I mention them here. I hadn't time to look
for an according Linux solution.
Cajun is a program that allows you to turn any computer (>75mhz) into a massive
audio jukebox for your car or home. It uses the MatrixOrbital serial display
and supports the IRman infra-red remote control interface. Soundcard output is
delivered to your (car or home) stereo for amplification. The software supports
a hotlist and shuffle mode. It includes FM/Video4Linux support, icecast/
shoutcast support, CrystalFontz serial display support, and choice of mpg123 or
xaudio for driving the sound card.

Appendix D. Appendix D - Recommendations for Buying a New Computer

Courtesy of Wade Hampton (modifications by wh): Purchase a low-power computer
such as a laptop or network computer. These typically don't use as much power
as desktop systems. For example, someone on the WWW had a Corel/Rebel Netwinder
powered by solar cells. I find it funny that an "Energy Star" desktop still has
a 300W power supply and uses far more power than a computer like the Netwinder
which uses something like 10 Watts of power, (though this is consistent with
the Energy Star goals for computer equipment, since they have targeted unused
power consumption).
Maybe there should be a new class of computers called "Energy Miser" (or
similar) that use nearly an order of magnitude less power than Energy Star
systems?
To save power for the display, one could purchase a LCD monitor instead of a
CRT. LCD monitors consume 30-40 Watts of power versus the 100's of Watts used
by most monitors. The price of an LCD is still 2-3 times that of a similar
monitor, but as LCDs become more widely used, the price will come down.
Make sure that any new computer purchase includes APM-compliant hardware and
low-radiation. Use TCO, DPMS or Energy Star compliant monitors.
R Horn <rjh at world.std.com> wrote: " I personally have found the Lawrence
Berkeley_Labs_-_LBL web site to be the best source for information on energy
efficient equipment. They go into considerable details on how to reduce energy
consumption from many kinds of equipment, including much more than computers.
They also have a good collection of links to related sites. The Energy Star
program is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has a web
site on it. So far all of the Energy Star regulations have been defined to
reduce energy usage without requireing change or restrictions on regular usage.
There is an amazingly large amount of electricity consumed by idle equipment
(computers, televisions, microwave ovens,...) and also large amounts consumed
unnecessarily by equipment that must be continuously one (emergency exit signs,
traffic lights, ...). Since this energy can be saved without asking users to
make any compromises on performance, it is being targeted first.
Somewhere on the LBL web site they have the actual power consumption figures
for various PCs. The 300W power supply is quite misleading. Actual power usage
varies depending upon what programs you run and whether the disks can be
powered down. Genuine usage while in operation is usually in the 50-75W range.
When the system is idle, it drops significantly.
The NetWinder is a nice machine, but does force operational compromises. The
peak CPU performance is much lower. The operating system is not Windows. And
there are other limitations. A closer comparison is the typical laptop PC.
These can generally be operated from a modest solar panel because their average
power drain is quite low. With these you can see the cost vs power consumption
tradeoff. They achieve the same performance as the desktop units, but the low
power consumption has doubled or tripled the cost.
(I personally use a Psion. A decent slow computer that requires only 200mw of
power. It may even run Linux once they deal with some of the ROM issues.)
The big debate in setting the energy star regulations was deciding which would
have greater overall benefit: small negligible cost improvements to almost all
equipment sold, or greater improvements at much higher cost? Could that cost be
invested elsewhere to greater benefit? How will the purchasers react to the
higher cost? So far the consensus has been that improving a large number of
machines at negligible cost is wiser than improving a smaller number of
machines at high cost."


Appendix E. Appendix E - A New Environmentally Friendly Hardware Design

Courtesy of Wade Hampton and Knut Suebert: New hardware designs that plan to
use Linux should take advantage of environmentally friendly technologies such
as low-power CPUs e.g., the ARM from Intel: , environmentally friendly battery
design, low-power displays (e.g., non-backlit LCDs), smaller packaging, etc.
Linux supports a WIDE variety of hardware and technologies. These could be
leveraged into powerful, flexible, environmentally friendly Linux-based
solutions.
An "Environmental Rating" could be created for new Linux-based hardware and
even some Linux-based software such as bottlerocket (X10). Devices such as the
Netwinder or the uCsimm would receive high ratings for their size, power
consumption, capabilities, etc.
At Telepolis_(German_Computer_Magazine) you might find an article about wasted
resources during computer manufacturing.
Generally speaking PPC CPUs consume less power than x86 CPUs.

To my surprise there are still many tools available to make an old 286 PC
useful. I started a search for 286 at Simtel.Net and found many useful
shareware programs. For instance:

When computer waste processing channels are not available yet in your country,
or are just not mature enough yet, another idea is too keep your computer waste
a few more years in your attic or in your cellar (provided you have storage
space). Better processing channels and recycling technologies will become
available over the years.
In some countries like France (and probably in the whole European Union), local
law makes it mandatory for consumer device shops to accept old devices for free
when you buy a new one, to ensure suitable processing or recycling of waste.
