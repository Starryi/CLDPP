The commercial computer market is largely driven by vendors seeking to sell new hardware and software. There is no commercial marketing benefit in promoting reuse.
</p><p>
Hence Linux doesn't require big hardware, it's very useful if you like or need to use old and small hardware.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm571"></a>1.1. Supported CPU Families</h3></div></div></div><p>
Linux runs on Intel-compatible processors (starting from the 386) and compatible processors by AMD, Cyrix and others. 
It also supports a long list of 32 and 64 bit processors.
The whole list can be found in the
<a class="ulink" href="http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/arch/" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>arch</strong></span>
directory in the Linux kernel sources</a>.
</p><p>
The ARM architecture is a fast AND low-power alternative,
used in a great number of embedded systems (Linux and others).
See the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/" target="_top">
ARM Linux Project</a> for a wealth of Linux
resources for ARM.
</p><p>
Linux is also supported on small, cheap and low power processors with no
Memory Management Unit (MMU), provided they are 32 bit ones. 
See the <a class="ulink" href="http://uclinux.org/" target="_top">uClinux</a> project for details.
</p><p>
Mainstream Linux requires at least a 32 bit processor
and doesn't support any 16 bit ones and will never do.
However, there are separate efforts from
the <a class="ulink" href="http://elks.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ELKS</a> project
to reuse Linux code for the 286 CPU family. 
</p><p>
On platforms supported by Linux, or even on some 16 bit processors,
you may also use the <a class="ulink" href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/" target="_top">eCos</a>
operating system. This is another free, POSIX compatible operating system
targeting very small devices (possibly with real-time requirements). 
</p><p>
If you like, you may use <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html" target="_top">Minix</a>,
one of the predecessors of Linux. Minix supports 8088 to 286 with as little as 640K memory.

Stripping: Though many distributions come with stripped binaries today it is useful to check this. For details see <span class="command"><strong>man strip</strong></span>. To find every unstripped file you can use the <span class="command"><strong>file</strong></span> command or more convenient the tool <span class="command"><strong>findstrip</strong></span> (find it in the Debian <a class="ulink" href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/perforate" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>perforate</strong></span></a> package) . Attention: don't strip libraries, sometimes the wrong symbols are removed due to a bad programming technique.
</p><p>
A recommendation from Russell Marks &lt;rus at beeb.net&gt;:
</p><p>
These days a lot of people compile with <span class="command"><strong>-g</strong></span>, which I find a bit annoying (though AFAIK this <span class="command"><strong>only</strong></span> loses you disk space, in practice).
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>strip</strong></span> has a <span class="command"><strong>--strip-debug</strong></span> option which doesn't strip symbols, but does still get rid of the debugging stuff. This is almost as good, in many cases, and it's ok to use it on libraries. As it happens, I recently got SuSE 6.3, so I can give you a <span class="command"><strong>live</strong></span> example:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

bash-2.03# ls -l libc.so.6

Sparse files: in the case when files contain blocks
with only null characters, these blocks can be replaced by <span class="command"><strong>lseek</strong></span>
command calls, saving space. Applications (and not the operating system) are

For example, both the <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>cp</strong></span>

Reduce Kernel Size: Either by using only the necessary kernel

<span class="command"><strong>bzImage</strong></span>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Compressed read-write filesystems:
</p><p>
- There was a project to add compression support to ext2 filesystems:
  <a class="ulink" href="http://e2compr.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">e2compr</a>.
  This project has a very limited usefulness as it is currently
  inactive and only supports very old 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions.
  No chance to get a working patch on the latest 2.4 and 2.6 releases.
</p><p>
- Fortunately, a very serious solution exists in the
  <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems" target="_top">Reiser4 filesystem</a>
  which includes a compression plugin. Using compression is even reported
  to be faster than not using it. Actual results should of course
  vary with the CPU and disk speed, and results might be disappointing on
  old machines.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Compressed read-only filesystems
</p><p>
- The idea is store parts of the system (typically executables and libraries through
the <span class="command"><strong>/bin</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>/sbin</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>/usr</strong></span> directories) in a separate, compressed and read-only
filesystem. This is great for saving space and for protecting the system from
extern attacks. However, the constraint is that software upgrades can no
longer be done when the filesystem is mounted. The whole filesystem contents must
be rebuilt and replaced at once.
</p><p>
- <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramfs" target="_top">CramFS</a>
was the first implemented solution, used by many embedded system makers.
Though still maintained, it is dramatically outperformed by SquashFS.
</p><p>
- <a class="ulink" href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SquashFS</a>
is the solution everyone should use now. Unlike CramFS, it has
no limitations on filesystem and file size, and it achieves
much better compression and read speed (up to 5 times!). 
On slow storage (like USB flash drives), replacing ext2
with SquashFS resulting in a 50% reduction on system boot time
(observed in a Linux demo developped by <a class="ulink" href="http://free-electrons.com" target="_top">Free Electrons</a>).

Partition Sharing: You may share swap-space (see
Swap-Space-HOWTO) or data partitions between different OS
(see <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span>).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
C library: use <a class="ulink" href="http://uclibc.org/" target="_top">uClibc</a> instead of the default
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/" target="_top">GNU C library</a> aka <span class="command"><strong>glibc</strong></span>.
It takes approximately 400 KB instead of 1700 (glibc). It used by many embedded Linux projects
as well as by several tiny Linux distributions. It should satisfy most needs, as the whole
Debian 3.0 was ported to it. Caution: if you replace the C library, all applications
also need to be recompiled with a dedicated gcc toolchain.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://busybox.net/" target="_top">Busybox</a>
- A toolbox implementing most Unix commands.
It takes at most 500 KB instead of approximately 10-30 MB with GNU implementations!
It is used by almost all embedded Linux projects and small Linux distros.
Most commands are implemented, even <span class="command"><strong>vi</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>wget</strong></span>,
a dhcp server and client, and even a http server sufficient for most needs.
Even if some rare command options are not implemented, even an experienced
Unix user hardly makes the difference with GNU commands!
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can save some space.
</p><p>
However, with old kernels, you will miss cool features (such as real-time preemption,
making your system much more responsive) and support for recent peripherals.
It is true that the Linux kernel accumulated bloat over the years: more features, support for more special cases...
Now that Linux is taking an increasingly dominant place in embedded systems, work is being done to control the kernel size.
The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/" target="_top">LinuxTiny</a> project releases a set of patches to
the Linux kernel sources. In the <span class="command"><strong>Configure Standard Kernel Features for Small Systems</strong></span>
kernel configuration section, you can unselect features you do not need in a simple computer.
The minimum compressed size you can achieve for a Linux 2.6 kernel for a simple PC is approximately 350 KB. 
Note that more and more LinuxTiny changes are now available in the standard Linux kernel (no patching necessary).
</p><p>
With the latest kernel releases, you may also try 
the <a class="ulink" href="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt" target="_top">
real-time preemption patches</a> from Ingo Molnar.
When full preemption is enabled, it adds unprecedented
responsiveness to the Linux kernel. The latency is much reduced,
suitable for real real-time systems (less than 100 us!).
It is definitely worth trying on old systems
to give them a new youth and improve the user experience!

- "This is a window manager for X. Ixt is similar in many
respects to such popular packages as Window Maker, Enlightenment, and
FVWM2. You might be interested in this package if you are tired of
window managers that are a heavy drain on your system resources, but you
still want an attractive and modern-looking interface."

GAZETTE</a>  : "It's a GUI, GUI,
GUI, GUI world! " - or so the major OS manufacturers would
have you belief. Truth is, that while this is increasingly the
case, there are times when the command line interface (CLI) is
still a very good choice for getting things done. It's fast,
generally efficient, and is a good choice on memory or CPU
constrained machines. And don't forget that there are still a lot
of very nifty things that can be done <span class="command"><strong>at the
console</strong></span>." "<span class="command"><strong>screen</strong></span> is a
full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal
between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each
virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64
(ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and
support for multiple character sets). Real multiuser support,
split screen support, hardstatus emulation support, configurable
window seperator and hardstatus strings, permanent window
seperator, many new escapes, logfile timestamps and flush timeout,
optional builtin telnet, optional Braille support, support for
history compaction."

- "is a lightweight HTTP proxy
designed to do the job with a minimum of system resource use.
It's ideal for small networks where a larger HTTP proxy such
as squid might be overkill or a security risk. This simplicity
also makes tinyproxy an ideal candidate for customization - it
takes very little time to read and understand the tinyproxy
source, and thus you can start adding your own desired
features on short order."
