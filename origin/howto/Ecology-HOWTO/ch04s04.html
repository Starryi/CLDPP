Another means of saving paper is through the use of comments and redline/strikeout markings when exchanging a document with a co-worker/colaborator. For example, a draft could be written using WordPerfect, then E-MAILed to a co-worker. They could update the draft and send it back to you. You can use WordPerfect's redline/strikeout features to see the changes. The document need not be printed until it is "final" or in "final draft" status.

Question: Can you use the back side of paper in a laser printer? I have not had much luck. You can use the paper that has been in a laser printer in an inkjet printer by using the other side.

You should purchase smaller computers and monitors when possible. This will save packaging material translating into less solid waste. For example the box for a 15" CRT monitor is 2-3 times the size of the box for a 15" LCD monitor. Linux works well with 15" LCD monitors on smaller computers like the Netwinder or <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thinworks.com/campaign/try_e3000.html" target="_top">E3000</a> .
</p><p>
Tough smaller monitors may have another ecological caveat: because it's inconvenient to browse to longer documents, people may tend to print the documents instead of reading them from the screen.
</p><p>
Some have expressed the concern that LCD displays may use more toxic materials and manufacturing processes than CRT displays, hence their usage actually may be worse on the environment. The original information above concerned the solid waste issue, which is fairly tangible and hence more controllable.
</p><p>
Does anyone know of studies or additional research to help clarify and resolve this issue?
</p><p>
Recycle your used paper, ink, and packing materials.
</p><p>
You may use refillable printer cartridges. In Germany the are marked with the <span class="command"><strong>Blauer Engel</strong></span> label.
</p><p>
Laser printer cartridges can often be used much more longer if you shake them when the message <span class="command"><strong>toner low</strong></span> appears at the message panel.

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
LaTeX documents:
Using <span class="command"><strong>\usepackage{ccfonts}</strong></span> replaces the usual fonts by ones with wider lines and bolder serifes, improving readability at low resolutions. They are darker (i.e. use more ink) than the CM fonts and not as beautiful, so I would not recommend them for normal-size printings.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Size-Reduction:
Instead of <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span> or other parts of the <span class="command"><strong>pstools</strong></span> check for enhanced Perl rewritings of <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span>.


</p><p>
It has a lot of options, which allow to set all 4 margins and the inner gutter separately. Since reduced documents are not very pretty anyway, this can be used to reduce the margin, leaving more place for the text. This probably requires some experimenting (trying new values over and over, checking the result with <span class="command"><strong>ghostview</strong></span>).
</p><p>
The normally used options are:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-p2</strong></span> (or <span class="command"><strong>-p4</strong></span> etc., like <span class="command"><strong>-2</strong></span> in the old <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span>)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-NIH</strong></span> (don't decorate)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-l10</strong></span> <span class="command"><strong>-r20</strong></span> <span class="command"><strong>-b30</strong></span> <span class="command"><strong>-t40</strong></span> (add to margins)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-g50</strong></span> (add to gutter)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
(these values vary depending on the papersize and the margins of the original, negative values are allowed).

<a class="ulink" href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam" target="_top">PDFjam</a>
is a small collection of shell scripts that  provide a
simple interface to some of the functionality of the pdfpages package for
pdfLaTeX. At present, the utilities available are pdfnup, pdfjoin, and
pdf90. PDFjam depends on a working installation of (pdf)LaTeX. pdfnup puts
multiple document pages together on one physical page at a reduced size.
pdfjoin concatenates multiple PDF documents. pdf90 rotates the pages of
PDF documents. For Mac OS X, some example applications (droplets) are
provided for drag-and-drop access to the scripts.

Different ink printers are more or less capable to print on the
backside of already used paper sheets. That's particularly
useful to reuse all single sided paper sheets you receive
for free every week! Try different manufacturers.
Older Canon ink printers offer 360 dpi, older HP ink printers 300
dpi. The readability of 4 pages/sheet using LaTex 10pt lies in
between this features.

Non-Linux:
If you have to work with MS-Windows you should get the original
Adobe-PostScript-Driver, instead of using the ones from
MS-Windows. These drivers offer more than one page per paper
sheet. AFAIK both <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span> programs don't work
with Adobe-PS, MS-Windows-PS and the PostScript extracted from
MS-Windows-PDF files. The Computer-Modern-Fonts (without German
diacritical characters) are available as TTF fonts on the CTAN
servers. With these fonts you may enhance the aesthetical value of
documents and save some paper space, too.

Ghostscript has a new output format <span class="command"><strong>pswrite</strong></span>,
which creates output in correct PostScript. This feature can be
used to repair broken PostScript e.g. from Microsoft drivers,
allowing their postprocessing with <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span> etc.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/impose+/" target="_top">impose+</a>
is a set of PostScript utilities. The main program is impose,
which is used for two-up printing of DSC-compliant PostScript
(including that from Netscape, dvips, and FrameMaker). It
makes an effort to remove white space from the printout by
probing the original PostScript for the bounding box of the
printed area. This makes the output much more esthetic than
does a simplistic layout of non-cropped original pages.

   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.hpgs.cjb.net/" target="_top">hpgs</a> is a
   printer driver that lets you to print on a HP 6xx Series
   printer using economic mode. It relies on the printer driver
   included in GhostScript to do everything but put the printer
   into economic mode.

   Besides command line tools for sophisticated printing there are also
   usefull GUI applications available.  KPrinter  opens  automatically
   when  you click on the "Print" icon of any KDE application. Choose your
   print job settings by going through the dialog and the click on the
   "Print" button.

   kprinter is a very versatile tool. Depending on the actual features
   and power of the print subsystem of your com- puter, kprinter
   translates the former's abilities into a nice and easy-to-understand
   GUI e.g. if your print subsystem does not support duplexing, kprinter
   will not show the option.

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   <a class="ulink" href="http://g-manual-duplex.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">gnome-manual-duplex</a>
   is a utility that adds manual duplex to the "Print" menu.

   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ecofont.eu/" target="_top">ecofont</a>
   is an open source sans serif font with holes added to save printer ink.

   If you need to print a lot of Web pages from inside your FireFox webbrowser, the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/951" target="_top">Nuke Anything Enhanced</a>
   extension will help you to save some ink and paper. Once installed,
   it adds a "Remove this object" option to the right-click context menu.
   Place your mouse over information you don't need printed (menu bars,
   big graphical logos and so on) and use "Remove this object" to zap
   them temporarily. Clean up the page, then print just what you need.
