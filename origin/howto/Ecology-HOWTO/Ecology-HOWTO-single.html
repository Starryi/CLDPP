   The Linux-Ecology-HOWTO discusses ways to make computers less harmful to
   our environment and to solve some ecological issues.  It explains how to
   use Linux to save power and consumables like paper and ink. Since it does
   not require big hardware, Linux may be used with old computers to make
   their life cycle longer. Games may be used in environmental education and
   software is available to simulate ecological processes.

Though computers can be seen as part of environmental pollution, there are
also ways to use computers in a more reasonable manner to help protect the
environment. So I have just started to collect some means to do so with
Linux.
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ecology-howto-objectives"></a>1. Objectives</h2></div></div></div><p>
Some objectives of the HOWTO:
</p><p>

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Reduction in power consumption.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Reduction in consumables like paper and inks.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Reduction in waste by reusing older components or keeping them in service longer.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Reduction in toxic waste such as used batteries.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Use of Linux in environmental education and research.
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ecology-howto-caveats"></a>2. Caveats</h2></div></div></div><p>
Some of the recommendations in this text are discussed controversial, for instance: powering down a device, when it's not in use. This may save power, but not under all circumstances. Also it may have other additional ecological costs, e.g. the life time of the device can be shortened.
</p><p>
I don't have enough technological knowledge to make a decision between these alternatives. Also some alternatives might be rated differently by different persons. So finally the decision what to choose is up to you. Anyway if you have better alternatives please let me know.

There are some means to save power when using a computer which are supported by Linux: Advanced Power Management, certain harddisk settings, working without monitor and others.
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ecology-howto-power-management"></a>1. Advanced Power Management (APM/ACPI)</h2></div></div></div><p>
Putting your GNU/Linux PC in suspend or hibernate mode.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm106"></a>1.1. ACPI</h3></div></div></div><p>
Most modern PCs support the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) standard.
The <a class="ulink" href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ACPI4Linux</a> project works on
implementing full ACPI support in the Linux kernel, including fan control, dock/undock detection.
</p><p>
All ACPI related information (such as processor or board temperature) is available through files
in <code class="filename">/proc/acpi</code>. For example, this makes it very easy for desktop environments
(or for your own programs) to display to temperature information somewhere on your screen.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm112"></a>1.1.1. Hibernate to disk</h4></div></div></div><p>
Use hibernate to disk and no longer be afraid
of switching off your system. Booting is much faster
than having to wait for services and graphics
to start up. Actually, most of the time is saved by getting back to your work
as you left it before suspending your computer (open files, terminals, browser windows).
There is no need to re-open everything!
</p><p>
While hibernating is often considered as a power saving solution
for notebook computers, it should also be used for desktop computers,
to save AC power. Use it when you go for lunch, when you leave the office
in the evening or for holidays...
</p><p>
Hibernating also saves a lot of time when you replace a battery of a notebook.
Again, hibernate, install a fresh battery, power up and get back to your
work as you left it off.
</p><p>
Technical details
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Hibernation to disk is implemented by the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.suspend2.net/" target="_top">Suspend 2 for Linux</a> project.
It consists of a kernel driver and a user-space program to control the driver.
Users just need to run the program (usually called <span class="command"><strong>hibernate</strong></span>).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
It works by copying the whole of used RAM to a swap partition.
As a consequence, it requires the swap partition to be at least as
big as the amount of RAM.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Both the patched kernel and the user-space program are very
easy to install through packages.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
    Here are
    <a class="ulink" href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/" target="_top">Fedora Core packages</a>
    for download.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    At least in the 6.06 release of (K)Ubuntu,
    hibernating is directly available as an option from the battery icon. 
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Go to your favorite package source for other distributions
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm135"></a>1.2. Older hardware with APM</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm137"></a>1.2.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h4></div></div></div><p>
From the 
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Battery-Powered/index.html" target="_top">Battery Powered Linux Mini-HOWTO</a>
" .. for APM to work on any notebook or energy-conscious desktop, the system BIOS ROM in the machine must support the APM standard. Furthermore, for APM to work with the Linux operating system, the system BIOS ROM must support either the 1.0 or 1.1 version of the APM standard, and it must also support 32-bit protected mode connections. A system that supports APM 1.1 is preferred, as it provides more features that the device driver and supporting utilities can take advantage of."
You may get information about the APM version with the <span class="command"><strong>dmesg</strong></span> command and in the <code class="filename">/proc/apm</code> file. 
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm143"></a>1.2.2. Introduction</h4></div></div></div><p>
When you first install Linux, you will probably have to recompile the kernel. The kernel that came with your distribution probably does not have APM enabled.
</p><p>
APM support consists of two parts: <span class="command"><strong>kernel</strong></span> support and <span class="command"><strong>user-land</strong></span> support.
</p><p>
For <span class="command"><strong>kernel</strong></span> support, enable the parameters in the corresponding kernel section. AFAIK not all features work with laptops. AFAIK the feature <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF</strong></span> works with most laptops.
</p><p>
The utilities for <span class="command"><strong>userland</strong></span> support may be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.worldvisions.ca/~apenwarr/apmd/" target="_top">WorldVisions</a>. APMD is a set of programs that control the Advanced Power Management system found in most modern laptop computers. If you run a 2.2.x kernel and want to experiment, Gabor Kuti &lt;seasons at falcon.sch.bme.hu&gt; has made a kernel patch that allows you to <span class="command"><strong>hibernate</strong></span> any Linux system to disk, even if your computers APM BIOS doesn't support it directly.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm156"></a>1.2.3. Caveats</h4></div></div></div><p>
If you have another operating system preinstalled or use another operating system at the same disk, make sure there is no "hibernation" or "suspend" tool installed, which could severely interfere with Linux, e.g. it might use disk space which is occupied by Linux or vice versa.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm159"></a>1.2.4. Troubleshooting</h4></div></div></div><p>
Sometimes X windows and APM don't work smoothly together, the machine might even hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader: Some Linux systems have their X server hang when doing <span class="command"><strong>apm -s</strong></span>. Folks with this affliction might want switch to the console virtual terminal then suspend <span class="command"><strong>chvt 1; apm -s</strong></span> as root, or, more appropriately, <span class="command"><strong>sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s</strong></span>.

<span class="command"><strong>cpufreq</strong></span> is a Linux kernel driver to control the CPU frequency.
It is included in all recent kernels and enabled by default by recent distributions.
It supports most recent "mobile" processors. Note that only such
processors support frequency scaling.
</p><p>
This driver lets user programs control cpu frequency
by writing files in
<code class="filename">/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu&lt;n&gt;/cpufreq/</code>.
</p><p>
Actually, frequency scaling is usually handled by
a <span class="emphasis"><em>governor</em></span> program, according 
to system or user specific preferences.
</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://carlthompson.net/Software/CPUSpeed" target="_top">CPUSpeed
</a>is the de-facto governor for Linux.
It allows to control the <span class="command"><strong>cpufreq</strong></span> driver
according to user defined criteria: CPU load, board temperature, battery / plugged in...
It is released by default in recent distributions. 
</p><p>
CPUspeed is usually configured through the <code class="filename">/etc/cpuspeed.conf</code> file
(Fedora Core 4 example):
</p><pre class="programlisting">
VMAJOR=1
VMINOR=1
DRIVER="speedstep-centrino"
OPTS="-i 2
-t /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature 70
-a /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state
-p 10 25
-m 600000 -M 1600000"
</pre><p>
After making changes, you can restart CPUspeed with
<span class="command"><strong>/etc/init.d/cpuspeed restart</strong></span> (Fedora Core example).
</p><p>
Type <span class="command"><strong>/usr/sbin/cpuspeed -h</strong></span> for details and more options.
</p><p>
You can type <span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/cpuinfo</strong></span>
to consult the current processor speed. That's useful
to check that the processor speed is scaled according
to your settings.

- A feature implemented in the Linux kernel since the 2.6.6 version.
The idea is to spin up the hard disk only when reading uncached data,
to delay and group disk writes, in order to reduce hard disk power consumption
and save battery life. Control scripts are shipped by default by recent
distributions.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>Laptop Mode</strong></span> may not be activated by default by distributions,

because of the risk to loose data in a crash or sudden power off.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://muru.com/linux/dyntick/" target="_top">Dynamic Tick</a>
is available since kernel 2.6.21 and later.
When enabled, this kernel feature allows to disable the
CPU timer interrupts when all processors are idle.
This way, idle systems are not woken up every 4 ms
(default setting in Linux 2.6) just to realize there is nothing to do!
This can save a little bit of power in notebooks
(and CPU cycles in virtual hosting servers). 
Regular timer interrupts are re-enabled when something
really happens, when a real hardware interrupt is received.
In kernel configuration, this feature can be selected
from the <span class="command"><strong>Kernel Features</strong></span>
section (<span class="command"><strong>NO_IDLE_HZ</strong></span> setting).
You can verify whether it is enabled with

In operating systems like Linux which comply with the POSIX standard,
filesystems are supposed to record the last time files are read.
With default kernel settings, even if files are read from the file
cache in RAM, this causes time data to be written to disk every
5 seconds. You may use a line like this 
<span class="command"><strong>/dev/hda3   /data   ext3   defaults,noatime,nodiratime, 1 2</strong></span> for example
in <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>.
</p><p>
To avoid this and reduce disk activity, you can add the <span class="command"><strong>noatime</strong></span>
mount option to lines in the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.

Do they only prevent the screen from being burned in or do they save power, too?
</p><p>
Some recommendations from Wade Hampton:
Screensavers usually display graphics, look for ETI, or perform other tasks.  When using your screensaver in this manner, you may actually consume MORE power. For example a computer using XSETI as a screensaver might get far warmer (hence use more power) than when it was being used to edit a document or perform a compile.
</p><p>
Some screen saver programs:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
The purpose of <span class="command"><strong>xscreensaver</strong></span> is to display pretty pictures
on your screen when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that
unattended monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like
they do in the movies. The benefit that this program has over the
combination of the <span class="command"><strong>xlock</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>xautolock</strong></span> programs is the ease with which new graphics
hacks can be  installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a
new display mode, you just change some resource settings. Any program which
can be  invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen
can now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge about
what it means to be a screensaver.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>LockVC</strong></span> is a console-locking-program combined with a
starfield screensaver. Executing LOCKVC on a virtual console brings up a
starfield that starts to rotate around all three axes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-display-power"></a>4.2. Display Power Control</h3></div></div></div><p>
To really save power, and if your X server plus monitor supports it, use the <span class="command"><strong>dpms</strong></span> option of <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> (see the manual page for <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span>). For example, to enable the DPMS (Energy Star) features of you X server: <span class="command"><strong>xset +dpms</strong></span>
</p><p>
You may also manually change the mode of your X display: 
</p><pre class="programlisting">
xset dpms force standby
xset dpms force suspend
xset dpms force off
</pre><p>
Note that <span class="command"><strong>suspend</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>off</strong></span> usually save much more energy than just <span class="command"><strong>standby</strong></span>,
especially in CRT displays.
</p><p>
According to manufacturers, switching off LCD displays more often doesn't
reduce their lifetime. As user can easily notice, there is no significant penalty
either between suspend and off modes in terms of switching on time.
</p><p>
In modern graphical desktop environments (like Gnome and KDE),
it is easy to configure automatic display switch off after a given
inactivity timeout:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
KDE display power management: configure it in
<span class="command"><strong>Control Center -&gt; Peripherals -&gt; Display -&gt; Power Control</strong></span>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Gnome display power management: configure it in
<span class="command"><strong>Desktop -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Screensaver -&gt; AdvancedControl Center -&gt; Peripherals -&gt; Display -&gt; Power Control</strong></span>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
AFAIK a CRT consumes on the order of 25 percent more power when displaying a <span class="command"><strong>plain white</strong></span> screen than displaying a <span class="command"><strong>plain black</strong></span> screen. So, a screensaver that's mostly black can help save power, even if it doesn't actually use DPMS to power down the screen. Of course, one that's very bright and colourful, or that keeps the CPU running fast is not much help.

On enterprise networks, or on the Internet, security constraints may require
that different services are run on different, isolated servers.
The problem with this one server per service approach
is that most spend a lot of idle time waiting for some rare activity bursts.
</p><p>
Several technologies now make it possible to run several GNU/Linux servers
inside a real, physical GNU/Linux server.  As in physical servers, each virtual server
is isolated from the others. So, this approach retains the benefits of
separate servers, but makes it possible to share some hardware resources
like the CPU and network bandwidth. On the other hand, each virtual server
enjoys a reserved amount of RAM and disk space.
</p><p>
The benefits of virtual servers are obvious in terms of cost, power consumption,
optimum use of hardware resources, and consumption of computer materials.
There is another key advantage for hardware maintenance: virtuals servers
can very easily and transparently be migrated from one physical server to another. 
</p><p>
Virtualization solutions:

I had a chance to discuss Energy Star with the designers of desktop printers. They confirmed that the allowable stand-by power targets depend on the device, and they only knew their targets. But they made some other interesting comments: 

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Energy Star ratings lead to significant operational power savings. Timer based power savings are the exception. Most savings come from designing in power on demand with low leakage drivers. For example, using stepper motors with low leakage current instead of high leakage.
</p><p>
This savings is both from individual designs and from the resulting demand for low leakage products causing better and cheaper low leakage product designs. The old-style (e.g. typewriter) design with one motor (always on) and various clutches is no longer the least cost.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Energy Star was good organizational engineering. It never required designers to compromise quality or performance, which made it much harder to argue against design changes to reduce power consumption while idle. Since most of the savings begin the millisecond that parts stop moving, these savings are considerable.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The power ratings on PC's are a safety rating, not a usage rating. So the 235W and 300W power supplies that commonly found in PCs are specifying their safety limits. Actual full power usage is much less, typically 20-30 percent of the safe limit. The designers also noted that it is actually difficult to measure the power consumption of a switching power supply. You need to use specially designed power meters. The regular AC meters are designed for motors, and are rather inaccurate for switching power supplies.

Some Linux applications use idle time in computers to cure diseases,

They run as a
low-priority process (nice 20), so you can work without noticing
that it's doing its task. Another use is for people who use P2P

that time the PC can be using the electricity it is consuming for

Linux halts the CPU in the idle cycle to further reduce power consumption. Early reports of OS/2, Win3.1/95, NT, and Linux showed Linux to use far less power than DOS-based O/S's that spun in the idle loop and consumed power -- this may have changed hence it would need research to validate.
</p><p>
Most Linux-users tend to leave their computer on for years whenever
possible. However, several modern BIOS's support an unattended powerup, and
with <span class="command"><strong>cron</strong></span> you can even do an unattended
<span class="command"><strong>shutdown</strong></span>. No need to leave the computer on night after
night. Other techniques to powerup your computer at certain times
are: ACPI-Wakeup, NVRAM-wakeup and the <span class="command"><strong>settime</strong></span> command.
Computers can even be power up on request remotely by means of
Wake-on-LAN using a network connection or Wake-on-Ring using an
old fashioned serial interface and a modem.
</p><p>
Beware of animated web pages! Web pages containing Flash, Java,
or just animated images can consume a lot of CPU.
When you leave your computer and keep it on,
make sure you close all browser pages with animations.
Otherwise, your PC may be left running at full speed while you are not using it.
</p><p>
To disable animated images in Mozilla Firefox
go to <a class="ulink" href="about:config" target="_top">about:config</a>,
find <span class="command"><strong>image.animation_mode</strong></span> and change its value
to <span class="command"><strong>none</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>once</strong></span>.
</p><p>
Do not forget to switch off your DSL modem / wireless router / ISP box / printers
at night or during vacations if you don't use them.
These devices consume quite a lot (typically 15W).

Use <span class="command"><strong>psutils</strong></span> package to put more than one page on one sheet of paper. This collection of utilities is for manipulating PostScript documents. Page selection and rearrangement are supported, including arrangement into signatures for booklet printing, and page merging for n-up printing.
</p><p>
For example, to create a PostScript document with 4 pages per sheet:
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>psnup -nup 4 doc.ps &gt; doc4p.ps</strong></span>
</p><p>
Often HTML pages are not optimised for printing. You may use <span class="command"><strong>html2ps</strong></span>, a HTML to PostScript converter, to print HTML pages. "This program converts HTML directly to PostScript. The HTML code can be retrieved from one or more URLs or local files, specified as parameters on the command line. A comprehensive level of HTML is supported, including inline images, CSS1, and some features of HTML 4.0."
</p><p>
Or you may use <span class="command"><strong>mpage</strong></span> to print 2 up or 4 up (PS documents or ASCII text). This may be used to save up to 50 percent or more of your paper.
</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ecology-howto-printing-doublesided"></a>2. Double Sided Printing</h2></div></div></div><p>
One important way to save paper is to print on both sides of the paper. Depending on the printer capabilities, this can either be done manually (printing odd and even pages in 2 passes), or by instructing the printer to use both sides.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-printing-doublesided-printercontrol"></a>2.1. Printer control</h3></div></div></div><p>
If your GNU/Linux distribution is using the CUPS printing system (as most do nowadays), you can configure double sided printing through the CUPS administration interface. Open the <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost:631" target="_top">http://localhost:631</a> URL with a browser, type your root password if required, and configure any local printier supporting double sided printing. This applies by default to all future print jobs.
</p><p>
Print settings can also be changed on a job by job basis too. In particular, KDE and Gnome let applications select and configure printers for each print job.
</p><p>
If you are printing from the command line, you can use the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/lpr-wrapper/" target="_top">lpr-wrapper</a> to insert printer control instructions to PostScript files at print time. Example:
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>lpr-wrapper -od doc.ps</strong></span>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-printing-doublesided-manual"></a>2.2. Manual printing</h3></div></div></div><p>
If double sided printing is not supported by your printer, you can also achieve this by printing odd/even (or right/left) pages separately. Many graphical applications like OpenOffice.org let you do that.
</p><p>
If you print from the command line, you can also do this with <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage" target="_top">mpage</a>. From the manual page:
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-jfirst[-last][%interval]</strong></span>
</p><p>
Print just the selected sheets, specified  by  number,  starting at 1.  Here last defaults to the end of data, interval to 1.  Thus  -j1-10  selects  the first  10 sheets, while -j 1%2 prints just the odd- numbered sheets and -j 2%2  prints  just  the  even ones.
</p><p>
You can do double-sided printing, in two passes, as follows. If you use 3-hole punched paper, put it in  the  printer such that the holes will appear at the top of the page -- on the right as you pull out the  printer  tray,  in  our  Laser  writer II NTX. Print the odd-numbered sheets with
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-j 1%2 ...</strong></span>
</p><p>
Note the number of pages it  reports.   (Only  half this  many  will really be printed).  When printing finishes, if mpage reported an odd number of pages, remove  the  last  one  from the stack, since there will be no even-numbered sheet to match  it.   Then arrange  the  stack  of  paper  for printing on the other side.  (If it's punched, the holes  will  now be  on  the  left.)  On our II NTX, the paper comes out blank-side up; replace it  in  the  tray  still blank-side  up  but rotated 180 degrees.  For other printers, you figure it out.  Now print  the  even- numbered sheets in reverse order with
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-r -j 2%2 ...</strong></span>
</p><p>
Hoping no one else reaches the printer before you do.
</p><p>
   <a class="ulink" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/duplexpr/" target="_top">Duplex</a>
   is a set of sh scripts that emulates duplex printing (on
   both sides of the paper) for sheet-fed printers that do not  support
   duplex printing in hardware. It is intended for use on  printers connected
   to workstations. It can operate as a pipe so  that applications can use it
   as a duplex printing driver. Its  unique feature is its ability to print
   to print many duplex print  jobs in one batch, printing the odd sides of
   all jobs and then  the even sides in just two passes.

Or use <span class="command"><strong>less</strong></span>/<span class="command"><strong>xless</strong></span>/<span class="command"><strong>gless</strong></span> as a viewer instead of printing. You can view PostScript documents with <span class="command"><strong>gs</strong></span> and view PDF documents with either <span class="command"><strong>xpdf</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>acroread</strong></span> (from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_top">Adobe</a>). Ask yourself, do you --really-- need a hardcopy each time you decide to print something out.
</p><p>
For your own documents, a good idea is to create them in landscape mode, making them easier to read
without having to scroll up and down. Otherwise, readers may find reading from the screen
inconvenient and may then prefer printing. See PDF editions of the free 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com/" target="_top">Tux Magazine</a> for a nice examples.
</p><p>
What are the reasons why people don't read from the monitor:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Reading is slower up to 30 percent, see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9602.html" target="_top">Jakob Nielsen: In Defense of Print</a>. The speed can be improved by better hardware (e.g. TFT display, greater screen, though this is against the other below to take smaller CRTs) and better display software and fonts (type-1, t1lib, truetype, freetype).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

Paper seems better organizable and more secure to some people. I suppose this can be treated by better software (e.g. Linux) and hardware, too.
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
   Some people use handheld PC (e.g. PalmIII, Newton Message Pad, Psion 5) to 
   carry around documents to read rather than printing them out. At TuxMobil
   you may get information about 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_linux.html" target="_top">Linux compatibility for handheld PCs and PDAs</a>.
   Or they take eBook readers to read "Electronic Paper". At TuxMobil there is
   a section about
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/ebook.html" target="_top">Linux compatibility for eBook readers</a>, too.

Another means of saving paper is through the use of comments and redline/strikeout markings when exchanging a document with a co-worker/colaborator. For example, a draft could be written using WordPerfect, then E-MAILed to a co-worker. They could update the draft and send it back to you. You can use WordPerfect's redline/strikeout features to see the changes. The document need not be printed until it is "final" or in "final draft" status.
</p><p>
Question: Can you use the back side of paper in a laser printer? I have not had much luck. You can use the paper that has been in a laser printer in an inkjet printer by using the other side.
</p><p>
You should purchase smaller computers and monitors when possible. This will save packaging material translating into less solid waste. For example the box for a 15" CRT monitor is 2-3 times the size of the box for a 15" LCD monitor. Linux works well with 15" LCD monitors on smaller computers like the Netwinder or <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thinworks.com/campaign/try_e3000.html" target="_top">E3000</a> .
</p><p>
Tough smaller monitors may have another ecological caveat: because it's inconvenient to browse to longer documents, people may tend to print the documents instead of reading them from the screen.
</p><p>
Some have expressed the concern that LCD displays may use more toxic materials and manufacturing processes than CRT displays, hence their usage actually may be worse on the environment. The original information above concerned the solid waste issue, which is fairly tangible and hence more controllable.
</p><p>
Does anyone know of studies or additional research to help clarify and resolve this issue?
</p><p>
Recycle your used paper, ink, and packing materials.
</p><p>
You may use refillable printer cartridges. In Germany the are marked with the <span class="command"><strong>Blauer Engel</strong></span> label.
</p><p>
Laser printer cartridges can often be used much more longer if you shake them when the message <span class="command"><strong>toner low</strong></span> appears at the message panel.
</p><p>

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
LaTeX documents:
Using <span class="command"><strong>\usepackage{ccfonts}</strong></span> replaces the usual fonts by ones with wider lines and bolder serifes, improving readability at low resolutions. They are darker (i.e. use more ink) than the CM fonts and not as beautiful, so I would not recommend them for normal-size printings.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

It has a lot of options, which allow to set all 4 margins and the inner gutter separately. Since reduced documents are not very pretty anyway, this can be used to reduce the margin, leaving more place for the text. This probably requires some experimenting (trying new values over and over, checking the result with <span class="command"><strong>ghostview</strong></span>).
</p><p>

<a class="ulink" href="http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam" target="_top">PDFjam</a>
is a small collection of shell scripts that  provide a

pdfLaTeX. At present, the utilities available are pdfnup, pdfjoin, and
pdf90. PDFjam depends on a working installation of (pdf)LaTeX. pdfnup puts
multiple document pages together on one physical page at a reduced size.
pdfjoin concatenates multiple PDF documents. pdf90 rotates the pages of
PDF documents. For Mac OS X, some example applications (droplets) are
provided for drag-and-drop access to the scripts.

Different ink printers are more or less capable to print on the
backside of already used paper sheets. That's particularly
useful to reuse all single sided paper sheets you receive
for free every week! Try different manufacturers.
Older Canon ink printers offer 360 dpi, older HP ink printers 300
dpi. The readability of 4 pages/sheet using LaTex 10pt lies in
between this features.

Non-Linux:
If you have to work with MS-Windows you should get the original
Adobe-PostScript-Driver, instead of using the ones from
MS-Windows. These drivers offer more than one page per paper
sheet. AFAIK both <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span> programs don't work
with Adobe-PS, MS-Windows-PS and the PostScript extracted from
MS-Windows-PDF files. The Computer-Modern-Fonts (without German
diacritical characters) are available as TTF fonts on the CTAN
servers. With these fonts you may enhance the aesthetical value of
documents and save some paper space, too.

Ghostscript has a new output format <span class="command"><strong>pswrite</strong></span>,

   kprinter is a very versatile tool. Depending on the actual features
   and power of the print subsystem of your com- puter, kprinter

   Depending on wordlength and paragraphlength a multi-column layout
   sometimes saves paper space (though the likelihood for a word to be broken
   increases, on the other hand the space used by incomplete lines at the end
   of paragraphs decreases). This doesn't save very much paper, but may fit
   2.1 pages in 2.0, therefore with the use of <span class="command"><strong>psnup</strong></span> it
   may fit on one page. Also multicolumn layout is better readable.

The commercial computer market is largely driven by vendors seeking to sell new hardware and software. There is no commercial marketing benefit in promoting reuse.
</p><p>
Hence Linux doesn't require big hardware, it's very useful if you like or need to use old and small hardware.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm571"></a>1.1. Supported CPU Families</h3></div></div></div><p>
Linux runs on Intel-compatible processors (starting from the 386) and compatible processors by AMD, Cyrix and others. 
It also supports a long list of 32 and 64 bit processors.
The whole list can be found in the
<a class="ulink" href="http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/arch/" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>arch</strong></span>
directory in the Linux kernel sources</a>.
</p><p>
The ARM architecture is a fast AND low-power alternative,
used in a great number of embedded systems (Linux and others).
See the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/" target="_top">
ARM Linux Project</a> for a wealth of Linux
resources for ARM.
</p><p>
Linux is also supported on small, cheap and low power processors with no
Memory Management Unit (MMU), provided they are 32 bit ones. 
See the <a class="ulink" href="http://uclinux.org/" target="_top">uClinux</a> project for details.
</p><p>
Mainstream Linux requires at least a 32 bit processor
and doesn't support any 16 bit ones and will never do.
However, there are separate efforts from
the <a class="ulink" href="http://elks.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ELKS</a> project
to reuse Linux code for the 286 CPU family. 
</p><p>
On platforms supported by Linux, or even on some 16 bit processors,
you may also use the <a class="ulink" href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/" target="_top">eCos</a>
operating system. This is another free, POSIX compatible operating system
targeting very small devices (possibly with real-time requirements). 
</p><p>
If you like, you may use <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html" target="_top">Minix</a>,
one of the predecessors of Linux. Minix supports 8088 to 286 with as little as 640K memory.

Using Gentoo on Old Machines

 "Old computers don't have to run old software. Old software does not have it's
 bugs covered and is bad for security.

 Most modern distros will be very sluggish when run on those machines; not
 because they use new software, but because they expect to be run on new

There are different types of techniques to gain more disk space, such as sharing of space, freeing unused or redundant space, filesystem tuning and compression. Note: some of these techniques use memory instead of space. As you will see, there are many small steps necessary to free some space.

Stripping: Though many distributions come with stripped binaries today it is useful to check this. For details see <span class="command"><strong>man strip</strong></span>. To find every unstripped file you can use the <span class="command"><strong>file</strong></span> command or more convenient the tool <span class="command"><strong>findstrip</strong></span> (find it in the Debian <a class="ulink" href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/perforate" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>perforate</strong></span></a> package) . Attention: don't strip libraries, sometimes the wrong symbols are removed due to a bad programming technique.
</p><p>
A recommendation from Russell Marks &lt;rus at beeb.net&gt;:
</p><p>
These days a lot of people compile with <span class="command"><strong>-g</strong></span>, which I find a bit annoying (though AFAIK this <span class="command"><strong>only</strong></span> loses you disk space, in practice).
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>strip</strong></span> has a <span class="command"><strong>--strip-debug</strong></span> option which doesn't strip symbols, but does still get rid of the debugging stuff. This is almost as good, in many cases, and it's ok to use it on libraries. As it happens, I recently got SuSE 6.3, so I can give you a <span class="command"><strong>live</strong></span> example:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
bash-2.03# cd /lib

bash-2.03# strip --strip-debug libc.so.6
bash-2.03# ls -l libc.so.6

Sparse files: in the case when files contain blocks
with only null characters, these blocks can be replaced by <span class="command"><strong>lseek</strong></span>
command calls, saving space. Applications (and not the operating system) are

For example, both the <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>cp</strong></span>

Reduce Kernel Size: Either by using only the necessary kernel

<span class="command"><strong>bzImage</strong></span>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Compressed read-write filesystems:
</p><p>
- There was a project to add compression support to ext2 filesystems:
  <a class="ulink" href="http://e2compr.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">e2compr</a>.
  This project has a very limited usefulness as it is currently
  inactive and only supports very old 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions.
  No chance to get a working patch on the latest 2.4 and 2.6 releases.
</p><p>
- Fortunately, a very serious solution exists in the
  <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems" target="_top">Reiser4 filesystem</a>
  which includes a compression plugin. Using compression is even reported
  to be faster than not using it. Actual results should of course
  vary with the CPU and disk speed, and results might be disappointing on
  old machines.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Compressed read-only filesystems
</p><p>
- The idea is store parts of the system (typically executables and libraries through
the <span class="command"><strong>/bin</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>/sbin</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>/usr</strong></span> directories) in a separate, compressed and read-only
filesystem. This is great for saving space and for protecting the system from
extern attacks. However, the constraint is that software upgrades can no
longer be done when the filesystem is mounted. The whole filesystem contents must
be rebuilt and replaced at once.
</p><p>
- <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramfs" target="_top">CramFS</a>
was the first implemented solution, used by many embedded system makers.
Though still maintained, it is dramatically outperformed by SquashFS.
</p><p>
- <a class="ulink" href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SquashFS</a>
is the solution everyone should use now. Unlike CramFS, it has
no limitations on filesystem and file size, and it achieves
much better compression and read speed (up to 5 times!). 
On slow storage (like USB flash drives), replacing ext2
with SquashFS resulting in a 50% reduction on system boot time
(observed in a Linux demo developped by <a class="ulink" href="http://free-electrons.com" target="_top">Free Electrons</a>).

Partition Sharing: You may share swap-space (see
Swap-Space-HOWTO) or data partitions between different OS

C library: use <a class="ulink" href="http://uclibc.org/" target="_top">uClibc</a> instead of the default
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/" target="_top">GNU C library</a> aka <span class="command"><strong>glibc</strong></span>.
It takes approximately 400 KB instead of 1700 (glibc). It used by many embedded Linux projects
as well as by several tiny Linux distributions. It should satisfy most needs, as the whole
Debian 3.0 was ported to it. Caution: if you replace the C library, all applications
also need to be recompiled with a dedicated gcc toolchain.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://busybox.net/" target="_top">Busybox</a>
- A toolbox implementing most Unix commands.
It takes at most 500 KB instead of approximately 10-30 MB with GNU implementations!
It is used by almost all embedded Linux projects and small Linux distros.
Most commands are implemented, even <span class="command"><strong>vi</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>wget</strong></span>,
a dhcp server and client, and even a http server sufficient for most needs.
Even if some rare command options are not implemented, even an experienced
Unix user hardly makes the difference with GNU commands!
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can save some space.
</p><p>
However, with old kernels, you will miss cool features (such as real-time preemption,
making your system much more responsive) and support for recent peripherals.
It is true that the Linux kernel accumulated bloat over the years: more features, support for more special cases...
Now that Linux is taking an increasingly dominant place in embedded systems, work is being done to control the kernel size.
The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/" target="_top">LinuxTiny</a> project releases a set of patches to
the Linux kernel sources. In the <span class="command"><strong>Configure Standard Kernel Features for Small Systems</strong></span>
kernel configuration section, you can unselect features you do not need in a simple computer.
The minimum compressed size you can achieve for a Linux 2.6 kernel for a simple PC is approximately 350 KB. 
Note that more and more LinuxTiny changes are now available in the standard Linux kernel (no patching necessary).
</p><p>
With the latest kernel releases, you may also try 
the <a class="ulink" href="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt" target="_top">
real-time preemption patches</a> from Ingo Molnar.
When full preemption is enabled, it adds unprecedented
responsiveness to the Linux kernel. The latency is much reduced,
suitable for real real-time systems (less than 100 us!).
It is definitely worth trying on old systems
to give them a new youth and improve the user experience!

Or you can buy an older computer (SGI, Sun, NeXT) that comes with unix and is capable of running a wide range of open source software. In some cases (SGI Indigo2) you can still run current OS versions, in others you may do better with an open source OS such as Linux, but in either case you have access to lots of good software and tools to write your own.

The lower power consumption of older computers means you get more reserve time from an UPS or can use a small alternative power source if you don't have access to "mains" power.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, Linux can be run on non-PC architectures.
This is particularly useful for the small applications old PCs can be used for.
Recent netbooks either ARM-based or MIPS-based provide an even smaller power
footprint. Check <a class="ulink" href="http://moblin.org/" target="_top">moblin</a> Linux, which is dedicated to
such machines.
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ecology-howto-ce-devices"></a>1. Using Consumer Electronics Devices</h2></div></div></div><p>
Linux is increasingly used in Consumer Electronics (CE) devices,
in particular in network appliances such as Wifi routers, DSL modems,
Network Attached Storage (NAS) servers, IP cameras and other small devices.
</p><p>
Thanks to the GNU GPL license, kernel and application source code for these devices
are freely available. More and more device owners are taking advantage of this
to develop other uses for these devices. Thanks to the progress of Linux in
embedded systems, making its own embedded system is increasingly easy.
</p><p>
Using such devices instead of regular PCs yields many advantages:
much lower power consumption, no noise (no fans), built with much
fewer materials (small size), and much lower cost (for your purse
and for the environment).

In a nutshell, do not buy a new PC for small applications.
Reuse your old computers or buy a consumer device on which you can run Linux! 
</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ecology-howto-embedded-boards"></a>2. Using Embedded Linux Boards</h2></div></div></div><p>
Instead of using a PC, or even instead reusing a consumer device,
you may also create your own system using dedicated embedded system boards.
Because of lower volumes, such boards may be a bit more expensive,
but they can achieve much reduced size and power consumption.
Both low and higher volumes are available too.
</p><p>
Here are a few noteworthy examples:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

"X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set back a thermostat."
</p><p>
These <a class="ulink" href="http://www.x10.com" target="_top">X10</a> folks make a really cool dongle called the Firecracker.
These allow for the control of X10 devices via a serial-port of your PC.
Programs like <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxha.com/bottlerocket/" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>Bottlerocket</strong></span></a>
and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.miscreation.net/projects/gtkx10/" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>GtkX10</strong></span></a>
allow Linux programs to control X10 devices using the Firecracker device.
You may be able to get the Firecracker, a remote control, a receiver,
and a lamp module for as little as $5.95 U.S. (special promotion).

<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joethielen.com/phantom/home/" target="_top">GNU Phantom.Home</a> is a computer controlled home automation system. The software includes a circuit diagram for building the Phantom.Home.Controller, a simple circuit board that attaches to your PC's parallel port. Using the combination of hardware/software you can control (i.e. flip on or off) nearly any 120V device. And with a little bit of electronics know-how, you can probably control nearly any device at any voltage by modifying the circuit board to meet your needs. The simple circuit included can be created and built for around $25. The modules cost around $10 (basically a heavy duty relay).

</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-ups"></a>Chapter 11. Uninterruptible Power Supply - UPS</h1></div></div></div><p>
You should use a protection against lightening and power surges or a UPS
if you have many thunderstorms in the area.
That will save hardware, software, your time, and money, and help prevent you from throwing out
that old monitor, CPU, or modem when it gets trashed by lightening.
For details consult the <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/UPS-HOWTO.html" target="_top">UPS-HOWTO</a>.
</p><p>
For desktop PCs, in areas prone to lightening or power outages, UPSs could save hours
of work each week, potentially translating into power savings.
However, there is some concern over their additional usage of AC power.
If anyone has any studies or research on this issue, could they please forward it to us?
That would be an interesting question to post to APC, BEST, etc.
</p><p>
UPSs also contain batteries with a high environmental cost.
So, just use a UPS when really needed and when benefits
outweight environmental costs. 
For example, if you are using a notebook, a much cheaper surge protection is enough
thanks to your battery.
</p><p>
People have also reported issues using unreliable power
sources, for example in trains. Make sure you use a surge protection
device then!

   Scientists of 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.reuse-computer.de/" target="_top">ReUse project</a>
   located at the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tu-berlin.de/" target="_top">Technical University of Berlin</a> recently compared the
   energy consumption of different computer types along the life cycle. The
   production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % less than 4
   years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer is used
   for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
   computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the
   stand-bye-mode still 100 Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80
   Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 Watt. Therefore from the
   ecological point of view it is better to buy an old computer
   that didn't need the energy for a new production and which
   consumes less electricity while it is being used.
</p><p>
   LCD displays need less energy than other monitors. For this reason
   laptops are the most ecological types of the compared computers. They
   need the smallest amount of energy when they are used. And 3 year old
   laptops are better than new ones since their processors need less
   energy than new examples. There is also an article in the
   German computer magazine
   <a class="ulink" href="http://heise.de/ct/" target="_top">C't 21/ 2003</a>.

   Quoted from the <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html" target="_top">PCMCIA-HOWTO</a>:
   "Card Services can be compiled with support for APM
   (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured your kernel
   with APM support. ...  The PCMCIA modules will automatically
   be configured for APM if a compatible version is detected on
   your system. Whether or not APM is configured, you can use
   <span class="command"><strong>cardctl suspend</strong></span> before suspending your
   laptop, and <span class="command"><strong>cardctl resume</strong></span> after resuming,
   to cleanly shut down and restart your PCMCIA cards. This will
   not work with a modem that is in use, because the serial
   driver isn't able to save and restore the modem operating
   parameters. APM seems to be unstable on some systems. If you
   experience trouble with APM and PCMCIA on your system, try to
   narrow down the problem to one package or the other before
   reporting a bug. Some drivers, notably the PCMCIA SCSI
   drivers, cannot recover from a suspend/resume cycle.  When
   using a PCMCIA SCSI card, always use <span class="command"><strong>cardctl
   eject</strong></span> prior to suspending the system."
</p><p>
You should use the internal modem in a laptop instead of a PCMCIA modem, if possible (it may be a WinModem).

If you don't need infrared support,
disable it in the BIOS or shutdown the
IrDA device driver. There are also some
IrDA features of the kernel which are
useful for saving power.

In the specifications of my HP
OmniBook 800 it is recommended to turn
off the IR port, if it is not in use,
because it may consume up to 10
percent of the battery time.

If necessary, you may also try to
disable the <span class="command"><strong>Fast RRs</strong></span> feature in the IrDA
section of the kernel. This option
will give you much better latencies
but will consume more power.

Courtesy of Wade Hampton (modifications by wh): Purchase a low-power computer such as a laptop or network computer. These typically don't use as much power as desktop systems. For example, someone on the WWW had a Corel/Rebel Netwinder powered by solar cells. I find it funny that an "Energy Star" desktop still has a 300W power supply and uses far more power than a computer like the Netwinder which uses something like 10 Watts of power, (though this is consistent with the Energy Star goals for computer equipment, since they have targeted unused power consumption).
</p><p>
Maybe there should be a new class of computers called "Energy Miser" (or similar) that use nearly an order of magnitude less power than Energy Star systems?
</p><p>
To save power for the display, one could purchase a LCD monitor instead of a CRT. LCD monitors consume 30-40 Watts of power versus the 100's of Watts used by most monitors.  The price of an LCD is still 2-3 times that of a similar monitor, but as LCDs become more widely used, the price will come down.
</p><p>
Make sure that any new computer purchase includes APM-compliant hardware and low-radiation. Use TCO, DPMS or Energy Star compliant monitors.

R Horn &lt;rjh at world.std.com&gt; wrote: " I personally have found the <a class="ulink" href="http://eande.lbl.gov/" target="_top">Lawrence Berkeley Labs - LBL</a> web site to be the best source for information on energy efficient equipment. They go into considerable details on how to reduce energy consumption from many kinds of equipment, including much more than computers.  They also have a good collection of links to related sites. The Energy Star program is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has a web site on it. So far all of the Energy Star regulations have been defined to reduce energy usage without requireing change or restrictions on regular usage.  There is an amazingly large amount of electricity consumed by idle equipment (computers, televisions, microwave ovens,...) and also large amounts consumed unnecessarily by equipment that must be continuously one (emergency exit signs, traffic lights, ...). Since this energy can be saved without asking users to make any compromises on performance, it is being targeted first.
</p><p>
Somewhere on the LBL web site they have the actual power consumption figures for various PCs. The 300W power supply is quite misleading. Actual power usage varies depending upon what programs you run and whether the disks can be powered down. Genuine usage while in operation is usually in the 50-75W range. When the system is idle, it drops significantly.
</p><p>
The NetWinder is a nice machine, but does force operational compromises. The peak CPU performance is much lower.  The operating system is not Windows.  And there are other limitations. A closer comparison is the typical laptop PC.  These can generally be operated from a modest solar panel because their average power drain is quite low.  With these you can see the cost vs power consumption tradeoff. They achieve the same performance as the desktop units, but the low power consumption has doubled or tripled the cost.
</p><p>
(I personally use a Psion.  A decent slow computer that requires only 200mw of power. It may even run Linux once they deal with some of the ROM issues.)
</p><p>
The big debate in setting the energy star regulations was deciding which would have greater overall benefit: small negligible cost improvements to almost all equipment sold, or greater improvements at much higher cost? Could that cost be invested elsewhere to greater benefit?  How will the purchasers react to the higher cost? So far the consensus has been that improving a large number of machines at negligible cost is wiser than improving a smaller number of machines at high cost."

Courtesy of Wade Hampton and Knut Suebert: New hardware designs that plan
to use Linux should take advantage of environmentally friendly technologies
such as low-power CPUs e.g., the ARM from Intel: 

, environmentally friendly battery design, low-power displays (e.g., non-backlit LCDs), smaller packaging, etc.  Linux supports a WIDE variety of hardware and technologies. These could be leveraged into powerful, flexible, environmentally friendly Linux-based solutions. 
</p><p>
An "Environmental Rating" could be created for new Linux-based hardware and even some Linux-based software such as <span class="command"><strong>bottlerocket</strong></span> (X10). Devices such as the Netwinder or the uCsimm would receive high ratings for their size, power consumption, capabilities, etc.

Generally speaking PPC CPUs consume less power than x86 CPUs.

When computer waste processing channels are not available yet in
your country, or are just not mature enough yet, another idea is too keep
your computer waste a few more years in your attic or in your cellar (provided
you have storage space). Better processing channels and recycling technologies
will become available over the years. 
</p><p>
In some countries like France (and probably in the whole European Union),
local law makes it mandatory for consumer device shops to accept
old devices for free when you buy a new one, to ensure suitable processing
or recycling of waste.
