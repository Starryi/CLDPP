Putting your GNU/Linux PC in suspend or hibernate mode.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm106"></a>1.1. ACPI</h3></div></div></div><p>
Most modern PCs support the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) standard.
The <a class="ulink" href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ACPI4Linux</a> project works on
implementing full ACPI support in the Linux kernel, including fan control, dock/undock detection.
</p><p>
All ACPI related information (such as processor or board temperature) is available through files
in <code class="filename">/proc/acpi</code>. For example, this makes it very easy for desktop environments
(or for your own programs) to display to temperature information somewhere on your screen.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm112"></a>1.1.1. Hibernate to disk</h4></div></div></div><p>
Use hibernate to disk and no longer be afraid
of switching off your system. Booting is much faster
than having to wait for services and graphics
to start up. Actually, most of the time is saved by getting back to your work
as you left it before suspending your computer (open files, terminals, browser windows).
There is no need to re-open everything!
</p><p>
While hibernating is often considered as a power saving solution
for notebook computers, it should also be used for desktop computers,
to save AC power. Use it when you go for lunch, when you leave the office
in the evening or for holidays...
</p><p>
Hibernating also saves a lot of time when you replace a battery of a notebook.
Again, hibernate, install a fresh battery, power up and get back to your
work as you left it off.
</p><p>
Technical details
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Hibernation to disk is implemented by the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.suspend2.net/" target="_top">Suspend 2 for Linux</a> project.
It consists of a kernel driver and a user-space program to control the driver.
Users just need to run the program (usually called <span class="command"><strong>hibernate</strong></span>).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
It works by copying the whole of used RAM to a swap partition.
As a consequence, it requires the swap partition to be at least as
big as the amount of RAM.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Both the patched kernel and the user-space program are very
easy to install through packages.

From the 
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Battery-Powered/index.html" target="_top">Battery Powered Linux Mini-HOWTO</a>
" .. for APM to work on any notebook or energy-conscious desktop, the system BIOS ROM in the machine must support the APM standard. Furthermore, for APM to work with the Linux operating system, the system BIOS ROM must support either the 1.0 or 1.1 version of the APM standard, and it must also support 32-bit protected mode connections. A system that supports APM 1.1 is preferred, as it provides more features that the device driver and supporting utilities can take advantage of."
You may get information about the APM version with the <span class="command"><strong>dmesg</strong></span> command and in the <code class="filename">/proc/apm</code> file. 
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm143"></a>1.2.2. Introduction</h4></div></div></div><p>
When you first install Linux, you will probably have to recompile the kernel. The kernel that came with your distribution probably does not have APM enabled.
</p><p>
APM support consists of two parts: <span class="command"><strong>kernel</strong></span> support and <span class="command"><strong>user-land</strong></span> support.
</p><p>
For <span class="command"><strong>kernel</strong></span> support, enable the parameters in the corresponding kernel section. AFAIK not all features work with laptops. AFAIK the feature <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF</strong></span> works with most laptops.
</p><p>
The utilities for <span class="command"><strong>userland</strong></span> support may be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.worldvisions.ca/~apenwarr/apmd/" target="_top">WorldVisions</a>. APMD is a set of programs that control the Advanced Power Management system found in most modern laptop computers. If you run a 2.2.x kernel and want to experiment, Gabor Kuti &lt;seasons at falcon.sch.bme.hu&gt; has made a kernel patch that allows you to <span class="command"><strong>hibernate</strong></span> any Linux system to disk, even if your computers APM BIOS doesn't support it directly.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm156"></a>1.2.3. Caveats</h4></div></div></div><p>
If you have another operating system preinstalled or use another operating system at the same disk, make sure there is no "hibernation" or "suspend" tool installed, which could severely interfere with Linux, e.g. it might use disk space which is occupied by Linux or vice versa.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm159"></a>1.2.4. Troubleshooting</h4></div></div></div><p>
Sometimes X windows and APM don't work smoothly together, the machine might even hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader: Some Linux systems have their X server hang when doing <span class="command"><strong>apm -s</strong></span>. Folks with this affliction might want switch to the console virtual terminal then suspend <span class="command"><strong>chvt 1; apm -s</strong></span> as root, or, more appropriately, <span class="command"><strong>sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s</strong></span>. I have these commands in a script, say, <span class="command"><strong>my-suspend</strong></span> and then do <span class="command"><strong>xapmload --click-command my-suspend</strong></span> .
</p><p>
On some new machines (for instance HP Omnibook 4150 - 366 MHz model) when accessing <code class="filename">/proc/apm</code>, you may get a kernel fault <span class="command"><strong>general protection fault: f000</strong></span>. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~sfr/" target="_top">Stephen Rothwell</a> explains: "This is your APM BIOS attempting to use a real mode segment while in protected mode, i.e. it is a bug in your BIOS. .. We have seen a few of these recently, except all the others are in the power off code in the BIOS wher we can work around it by returning to real mode before attempting to power off. Here we cannot do this."
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-cpufreq"></a>1.3. Processor frequency scaling</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="command"><strong>cpufreq</strong></span> is a Linux kernel driver to control the CPU frequency.
It is included in all recent kernels and enabled by default by recent distributions.
It supports most recent "mobile" processors. Note that only such
processors support frequency scaling.
</p><p>
This driver lets user programs control cpu frequency
by writing files in
<code class="filename">/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu&lt;n&gt;/cpufreq/</code>.
</p><p>
Actually, frequency scaling is usually handled by
a <span class="emphasis"><em>governor</em></span> program, according 
to system or user specific preferences.
</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://carlthompson.net/Software/CPUSpeed" target="_top">CPUSpeed
</a>is the de-facto governor for Linux.
It allows to control the <span class="command"><strong>cpufreq</strong></span> driver
according to user defined criteria: CPU load, board temperature, battery / plugged in...
It is released by default in recent distributions. 
</p><p>
CPUspeed is usually configured through the <code class="filename">/etc/cpuspeed.conf</code> file
(Fedora Core 4 example):
</p><pre class="programlisting">
VMAJOR=1
VMINOR=1
DRIVER="speedstep-centrino"
OPTS="-i 2
-t /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature 70
-a /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state
-p 10 25
-m 600000 -M 1600000"
</pre><p>
After making changes, you can restart CPUspeed with
<span class="command"><strong>/etc/init.d/cpuspeed restart</strong></span> (Fedora Core example).
</p><p>
Type <span class="command"><strong>/usr/sbin/cpuspeed -h</strong></span> for details and more options.
</p><p>
You can type <span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/cpuinfo</strong></span>
to consult the current processor speed. That's useful
to check that the processor speed is scaled according
to your settings.

<a class="ulink" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsamwel/laptop_mode/" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>Laptop Mode</strong></span></a>
- A feature implemented in the Linux kernel since the 2.6.6 version.
The idea is to spin up the hard disk only when reading uncached data,
to delay and group disk writes, in order to reduce hard disk power consumption
and save battery life. Control scripts are shipped by default by recent
distributions.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>Laptop Mode</strong></span> may not be activated by default by distributions,
as it is not recommended for servers and laptops running on AC power,
because of the risk to loose data in a crash or sudden power off.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://muru.com/linux/dyntick/" target="_top">Dynamic Tick</a>
is available since kernel 2.6.21 and later.
When enabled, this kernel feature allows to disable the
CPU timer interrupts when all processors are idle.
This way, idle systems are not woken up every 4 ms
(default setting in Linux 2.6) just to realize there is nothing to do!
This can save a little bit of power in notebooks
(and CPU cycles in virtual hosting servers). 
Regular timer interrupts are re-enabled when something
really happens, when a real hardware interrupt is received.
In kernel configuration, this feature can be selected
from the <span class="command"><strong>Kernel Features</strong></span>
section (<span class="command"><strong>NO_IDLE_HZ</strong></span> setting).
You can verify whether it is enabled with 
<span class="command"><strong>cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep CONFIG_NO_HZ</strong></span>.

<a class="ulink" href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/linux/tips.html" target="_top">Mobile Update Daemon</a>
 is a drop-in replacement for the standard <span class="command"><strong>update</strong></span> daemon, <span class="command"><strong>mobile-update</strong></span> minimizes disk spin ups and reduces disk uptime. It flushes buffers only when other disk activity is present. To ensure a consistent file system call <span class="command"><strong>sync</strong></span> manually. Otherwise files may be lost on power failure. <span class="command"><strong>mobile-update</strong></span> does not use APM. So it works also on older systems.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The <span class="command"><strong>noatime</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>nodiratime</strong></span>
mount options can be used to reduce disk writings.
In operating systems like Linux which comply with the POSIX standard,
filesystems are supposed to record the last time files are read.
With default kernel settings, even if files are read from the file
cache in RAM, this causes time data to be written to disk every
5 seconds. You may use a line like this 
<span class="command"><strong>/dev/hda3   /data   ext3   defaults,noatime,nodiratime, 1 2</strong></span> for example
in <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>.
</p><p>
To avoid this and reduce disk activity, you can add the <span class="command"><strong>noatime</strong></span>
mount option to lines in the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.
</p><p>
This option doesn't have any known or significant impact on regular programs,
except perhaps for backup / archiving software for which file access time information
is useful.

Even if you don't use hibernate or suspend and 
switch off your system in a standard way, you still
have ways of saving time getting back to your work.
</p><p>
Modern graphical environments (KDE or Gnome)
restart the applications that were open when you logged out.
However, most applications just get back to their initial state
and you will probably need to open your files again.
</p><p>
For people who do not want to loose the HTML pages

command in the <span class="command"><strong>Bookmarks</strong></span> menu.
This is very convenient to restore a set of tabs

Firefox v3 can save the current state of the browser and will
