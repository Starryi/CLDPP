One important way to save paper is to print on both sides of the paper. Depending on the printer capabilities, this can either be done manually (printing odd and even pages in 2 passes), or by instructing the printer to use both sides.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-printing-doublesided-printercontrol"></a>2.1. Printer control</h3></div></div></div><p>
If your GNU/Linux distribution is using the CUPS printing system (as most do nowadays), you can configure double sided printing through the CUPS administration interface. Open the <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost:631" target="_top">http://localhost:631</a> URL with a browser, type your root password if required, and configure any local printier supporting double sided printing. This applies by default to all future print jobs.
</p><p>
Print settings can also be changed on a job by job basis too. In particular, KDE and Gnome let applications select and configure printers for each print job.
</p><p>
If you are printing from the command line, you can use the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/lpr-wrapper/" target="_top">lpr-wrapper</a> to insert printer control instructions to PostScript files at print time. Example:
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>lpr-wrapper -od doc.ps</strong></span>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ecology-howto-printing-doublesided-manual"></a>2.2. Manual printing</h3></div></div></div><p>
If double sided printing is not supported by your printer, you can also achieve this by printing odd/even (or right/left) pages separately. Many graphical applications like OpenOffice.org let you do that.
</p><p>
If you print from the command line, you can also do this with <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage" target="_top">mpage</a>. From the manual page:
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-jfirst[-last][%interval]</strong></span>
</p><p>
Print just the selected sheets, specified  by  number,  starting at 1.  Here last defaults to the end of data, interval to 1.  Thus  -j1-10  selects  the first  10 sheets, while -j 1%2 prints just the odd- numbered sheets and -j 2%2  prints  just  the  even ones.
</p><p>
You can do double-sided printing, in two passes, as follows. If you use 3-hole punched paper, put it in  the  printer such that the holes will appear at the top of the page -- on the right as you pull out the  printer  tray,  in  our  Laser  writer II NTX. Print the odd-numbered sheets with
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-j 1%2 ...</strong></span>
</p><p>
Note the number of pages it  reports.   (Only  half this  many  will really be printed).  When printing finishes, if mpage reported an odd number of pages, remove  the  last  one  from the stack, since there will be no even-numbered sheet to match  it.   Then arrange  the  stack  of  paper  for printing on the other side.  (If it's punched, the holes  will  now be  on  the  left.)  On our II NTX, the paper comes out blank-side up; replace it  in  the  tray  still blank-side  up  but rotated 180 degrees.  For other printers, you figure it out.  Now print  the  even- numbered sheets in reverse order with
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>-r -j 2%2 ...</strong></span>
</p><p>
Hoping no one else reaches the printer before you do.

   <a class="ulink" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/duplexpr/" target="_top">Duplex</a>
   is a set of sh scripts that emulates duplex printing (on
   both sides of the paper) for sheet-fed printers that do not  support
   duplex printing in hardware. It is intended for use on  printers connected
   to workstations. It can operate as a pipe so  that applications can use it
   as a duplex printing driver. Its  unique feature is its ability to print
   to print many duplex print  jobs in one batch, printing the odd sides of
   all jobs and then  the even sides in just two passes.
