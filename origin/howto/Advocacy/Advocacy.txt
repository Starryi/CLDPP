1. About this document

This is the Linux Advocacy mini-HOWTO and is intended to provide guidelines and
ideas to assist with your Linux advocacy efforts.
This mini-HOWTO was inspired by Jon ``maddog'' Hall when he responded to a
request for feedback on guidelines for advocating Linux during NetDay
activities. He responded positively to the guidelines and observed that they
were the basis of a list of ``canons of conduct'' that would benefit the Linux
community.

A personal note: Due to various circumstances, I have not been able to dedicate
as much time to maintaining this mini-HOWTO and interacting with the Linux
community as I would have desired. I apologize for this and if you have
attempted to contact me and I was slow in responding, please forgive me being
so inconsiderate. While I still have many other commitments, I am anticipating
that they will start requiring less time to meet and allow me to catch up on
other parts of my life. I appreciate your patience and would like to extend a
special thanks to all who have taken the time to suggest additions and
corrections.

3. Introduction

The Linux community has known for some time that for many applications, Linux
is a stable, reliable, robust (although not perfect) product. Unfortunately,
there are still many people, including key decision-makers, that are not aware
of the existence of Linux and its capabilities.
If Linux and the many other components that make up a Linux distribution are to
reach their full potential, it is critical that we reach out to prospective
``customers'' and advocate (being careful not to promise too much) the use of
Linux for appropriate applications. The reason that many a company's products
have done well in the marketplace is not so much due to the product's technical
superiority but the company's marketing abilities.
If you enjoy using Linux and would like to contribute something to the Linux
community, please consider acting on one or more of the ideas in this mini-
HOWTO and help others learn more about Linux.

5. Advocating Linux


* Share your personal experiences (good and bad) with Linux. Everyone knows
  that software has bugs and limitations and if we only have glowing comments
  about Linux, we aren't being honest. I love to tell people about having to
  reboot four times (three scheduled) in three years.
* If someone has a problem that Linux may be able to solve, offer to provide
  pointers to appropriate information (Web pages, magazine articles, books,
  consultants, ...). If you haven't actually used the proposed solution, say
  so.
* If you are available for making presentations about Linux, register with the
  Linux_Speakers_Bureau.
* Offer to help someone start using Linux. Follow up to make sure that they are
  able to use their system effectively.
* Some people still believe that Linux and similar systems operate only in
  text-mode. Make sure that they are aware of the availability of graphical
  applications, such as the Gimp.
* Try to respond to one ``newbie'' posting each week. Seek out the tough
  questions, you may be the only one to respond and you may learn something in
  the process. However, if you aren't confident that you can respond with the
  correct answer, find someone that can.
* Seek out small software development firms and offer to make a presentation
  about Linux.
* If the opportunity arises, make a presentation to your employer's Information
  Technology group.
* Participate in community events such as NetDay. While your first priority
  must be to contribute to the success of the event, use the opportunity to let
  others know what Linux can do for them.
* Always consider the viewpoints of the person to whom you are ``selling''
  Linux. Support, reliability, interoperability and cost are all factors that a
  decision-maker must consider. Of the above, cost is often the least important
  portion of the equation.
* Availability of support is often mentioned as a concern when considering the
  adoption of Linux. Companies such as Caldera, Cygnus_Solutions, Red_Hat, and
  S.u.S.E. offer support for some or all components of a typical Linux
  distribution. In addition, the Linux_Consultants_HOWTO provides a listing of
  companies providing commercial Linux related support. Of course, some of the
  best support is found in the comp.os.linux and linux newsgroup hierarchies.
* Point out that the production of open-source_software takes place in an
  environment of open collaboration between system architects, programmers,
  writers, alpha/beta testers and end users which often results in well
  documented, robust products such as Apache, GNU_Emacs, Perl and the Linux
  kernel.
* Stand up and be counted! Register with the Linux_Counter.
* Report successful efforts of promoting Linux to Linux_International
  ( li@li.org) and similar organizations.
* Find a new home for Linux CD-ROMs and books that you no longer need. Give
  them to someone interested in Linux, a public library or a school computer
  club. A book and its CD-ROM would be most appropriate for a library. However,
  please be sure that making the CD-ROM publicly available does not violate a
  licensing agreement or copyright. Also, inform the library staff that the
  material on the CD-ROM is freely distributable. Follow up to make sure it is
  available on the shelves.
* When purchasing books about software distributed with Linux, give preference
  to books written by the author of the software. The royalties that authors
  receive from book sales may be the only monetary compensation received for
  their efforts. <-- Need to fix or change the Powered by Linux text -->
* Encourage Linux-based sites to submit their entry for the Powered_by_Linux
  page and suggest that banners promoting Linux, Apache, GNU, Perl ... be
  displayed on their site.
* Participate! If you have benefited from open-source_software, please consider
  assisting the free software community by:

  o submitting detailed bug reports
  o writing documentation
  o creating artwork
  o supplying management skills
  o suggesting enhancements
  o providing technical support
  o contributing software
  o donating equipment
  o furnishing financial support.

  The Linux_Documentation_Project provides a list of Linux and Linux-related
  projects.
* Finally, keep in mind that we all have infinitely more important issues to
  deal with than the selection of a computing environment.


6. Canons of Conduct


* As a representative of the Linux community, participate in mailing list and
  newsgroup discussions in a professional manner. Refrain from name-calling and
  use of vulgar language. Consider yourself a member of a virtual corporation
  with Mr. Torvalds as your Chief Executive Officer. Your words will either
  enhance or degrade the image the reader has of the Linux community.
* Avoid hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims at all costs. It's unprofessional
  and will result in unproductive discussions.
* A thoughtful, well-reasoned response to a posting will not only provide
  insight for your readers, but will also increase their respect for your
  knowledge and abilities.
* Don't bite if offered flame-bait. Too many threads degenerate into a ``My O/
  S is better than your O/S'' argument. Let's accurately describe the
  capabilities of Linux and leave it at that.
* Always remember that if you insult or are disrespectful to someone, their
  negative experience may be shared with many others. If you do offend someone,
  please try to make amends.
* Focus on what Linux has to offer. There is no need to bash the competition.
  Linux is a good, solid product that stands on its own.
* Respect the use of other operating systems. While Linux is a wonderful
  platform, it does not meet everyone's needs.
* Refer to another product by its proper name. There's nothing to be gained by
  attempting to ridicule a company or its products by using ``creative
  spelling''. If we expect respect for Linux, we must respect other products.
* Give credit where credit is due. Linux is just the kernel. Without the
  efforts of people involved with the GNU_project, MIT, Berkeley and others too
  numerous to mention, the Linux kernel would not be very useful to most
  people.
* Don't insist that Linux is the only answer for a particular application. Just
  as the Linux community cherishes the freedom that Linux provides them, Linux
  only solutions would deprive others of their freedom.
* There will be cases where Linux is not the answer. Be the first to recognize
  this and offer another solution.


7. User Groups


* Participate in a local user group. An index of Linux User Group registries is
  part of the Linux_Documentation_Project. If a user group does not exist in
  your area, start one.
* The Linux_User_Group_HOWTO covers many of the issues involved with starting
  an user group and discusses the importance of Linux advocacy as one of the
  goals of a user group.
* Make speakers available to organizations interested in Linux.
* Issue press_releases about your activities to your local media.
* Volunteer to configure a Linux system to meet the needs of local community
  organizations. Of course, the installation process must include training the
  user community to use the system and adequate documentation for ongoing
  maintenance.
* Discus the Linux Advocacy mini-HOWTO at a meeting. Brainstorm and submit new
  ideas.


8. Vendor Relations


* When contemplating a hardware purchase, ask the vendor about Linux support
  and other user's experiences with the product in a Linux environment.
* Consider supporting vendors that sell Linux based products and services.
  Encourage them to have their product listed in the Linux_Commercial_HOWTO.
* Support vendors that donate a portion of their income to organizations such
  as the Free_Software_Foundation, the Linux_Development_Grant_Fund, the
  XFree86_Project or Software_in_the_Public_Interest. If possible, make a
  personal donation to these or other organizations that support open-source
  software. Don't forget that some employers offer a matching gift program
  program.
* If you need an application that is not supported on Linux, contact the vendor
  and request a native Linux version.


9. Media Relations


* Linux International is collecting press_clippings that mention Linux, GNU and
  other freely redistributable software. When you see such an article, please
  send the following information to clippings@li.org:

  o Name of publication
  o Publisher's contact address
  o Name of author
  o Author's contact address
  o Title of article
  o Page number where the article starts
  o The URL if available online
  o A summary of the article, including your opinion

* If you believe that Linux was not given fair treatment in an article, review
  or news story, send the details, including the above information, to
  li@li.org so that an appropriate response can be sent to the publisher. If
  you contact the publisher directly, be professional and sure of your facts.
* If you involved with a Linux related project, issue press_releases to
  appropriate news services on a regular basis.
