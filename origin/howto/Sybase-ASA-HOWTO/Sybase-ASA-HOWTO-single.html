It has information about the customer (for example, her name, address

the sales representative (for example his name, department, and
office phone number). Let's put all this into a table, with the

>Everything appears nice and ordered, but there's a fair bit
of redundancy. M. Devlin's name appears twice, along with his address
and phone number. E. Peros' details appear three times. If you look
carefully at the employee side of things, you'll notice that M.
Garcia is repeated, as well. </P
><P
>Wouldn't it be nice if you could separate that information
and only store it once, rather than several times? In the long term,
it would certainly save disk space and allow for greater flexibility.
Since redundant data entry is minimized, it would also reduce the
chances of erroneous data entering the database, increasing consistency.
Well, we can see three different entities involved here: the customer,
the order, and the employee. So let's take each of the individuals,
put them into categories, and give them identification numbers so
they can be referenced. </P

>As you can see, each customer's information is stored only
once, and the same goes for each employee. The sales_order table
is a lot smaller, too. Each row, representing a sales order, refers
to a cust_id and an emp_id. </P
><P
>By looking up the customer corresponding to a cust_id (which
is unique), one can find all the needed data on that customer, without
having to repeat it in sales_order. In addition, an id column has
been added. Its purpose will be explained in the next section. </P
><P
>Why do this, you ask? By eliminating redundancy, this kind
of structure reduces the opportunities for inconsistencies to seep
in, in addition to lowering storage requirements. If you had to
change E. Peros' address in the old sales_order table, you'd have
to do it three times, which would take three times as long and give
you three times as many chances to make an error. In the newer table,
all you'd have to do is change her address once, in the customer
table. Also, by carefully separating data, you make access control
simpler. </P

>As described in the previous section, you can separate a table
into interrelated tables. But how do you go about relating tables
to each other? In relational databases, primary keys and foreign
keys help you link tables together. Primary keys are columns that
uniquely identify each row of a table, and foreign keys define the
relationship between the rows of two separate tables. Proper use
of primary and foreign keys will help you efficiently hold information
without excessive redundancy. </P
><P
>Every table should have a primary key to ensure that each
row is uniquely identified. This often takes the form of an ID number
being assigned to each row, as in the previous section's example.
The id column forms the primary key. </P
><P
>As long as you can guarantee the uniqueness of the data in
a particular column, though, that column can be a primary key. For
example, if you only want one entry per day to be put into a particular
table, you could use the date as that table's primary key. </P
><P
>Tables are related to one another by foreign keys. In the
sales_order example, the cust_id and sales_rep columns would be
called foreign keys to the customer and employee tables, respectively.
For terminology's sake, you might want to know that in this case,
the sales_order table is called the <EM
>foreign</EM
> or <EM
>referencing</EM
> table,
while the customer and employee tables are called the <EM
>primary</EM

>referenced</EM

alone. It takes place as part of a cycle that begins with a full
backup, which is then followed by a given number of incremental backups.
Since only the transaction log is copied, an incremental backup
uses less time and resources, making it particularly suited for
large databases. Keep in mind, though, that the more time you leave
between full backups, the greater the risk of losing data in the
event that one of the transaction logs becomes unusable. </P

>6.3.2. Views, procedures, and triggers</A
></H4
><P
>Views are useful when it is appropriate to give a user access
to just one portion of a table. The portion can be defined in terms
of rows or in terms of columns. For example, you may wish to prevent
a group of users from seeing the quantity column of the banana_supply
table, or you may wish to limit a user to see information on a particular
type of banana. </P
><P
>While views restrict access based on the data, procedures
and triggers restrict access based on the actions a user can take.
Procedures and triggers store SQL statements in a database for use by
all applications. They execute under the table permissions of the
associated table's owner, regardless of the permissions of the user
who either executes the procedure or fires the trigger. </P
><P
>Procedures are invoked by a CALL statement, and can take values
as well as return them. Unlike procedures, however, triggers are
can neither take values nor return them, and are invoked by insertions,
updates, or deletions in the table it is associated with. Permissions
are not associated with triggers. They execute when the action defined
to fire them is performed, regardless of the user.</P
><P
>For strict security, you can prevent all access to the tables,
and grant permission to users to execute certain stored procedures
that carry out specific tasks. This approach strictly defines the manner
in which the database can be modified. </P

>6.3.3. Encrypting client/server communications</A
></H4
><P
>Encrypting client/server communications prevents third parties
from reading messages being sent between the client and the server.
It can be enabled from either the server side or the client side.
To enable encryption from the server, use the -e option at server
startup. For example, use the following command to start up the
database server to accept encrypted connections to mydb.db over
TCP/IP: </P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dbsrv7 -e -x tcpip mydb.db </B
></P
><P
>To enable encryption from a particular client, use the ENC
keyword in the connection string. For example, to encrypt a connection
over TCP/IP to mydb.db, your connection string would appear as follows: </P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"uid=mortimer;pwd=monkey;links=tcpip;eng=MyServer;dbf=mydb.db;enc=true"</B
></P
><P
>For more information about client/server communications encryption,
look for the -e command-line option under "The database server"
in the Adaptive Server Anywhere Reference Manual, and for "Encryption
connection parameter" under "Connection parameters" . </P
