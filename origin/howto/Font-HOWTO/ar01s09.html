This can sometimes pose a problem. Typically, the ``Windows fonts'' are fairly easy to handle, because they are packed in a <code class="literal">zip</code> file. The only work to be done is converting the <code class="literal">pfm</code> file to and <code class="literal">afm</code> file (using <code class="literal">pfm2afm</code>).</p><p>Macintosh fonts are more problematic, because they are typically made available in <code class="literal">.sit.bin</code> format -- stuffit archives. Unfortunately, there is no tool for Linux that can unpack stuffit archives created with the newer version of stuffit. The only way to do it is run Executor (Mac emulator), or try running stuffit in dosemu or Wine. Once the <code class="literal">sit.bin</code> file is unpacked, the Macintosh files can be converted using <code class="literal">t1unmac</code> which comes with the <code class="literal">t1utils</code> package.</p><p>Unfortunately, some vendors only ship Type 1 fonts in Macintosh format (stuffit archives). However, according to font expert <a class="ulink" href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/" target="_top">Luc Devroye</a>, all major foundries make Type 1 fonts available for Mac and Windows.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm796"></a>9.2.2. Free Stuff</h4></div></div></div><p>
					<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ctan.org" target="_top">ctan</a> have a number of good fonts, many of which are free. Most of these are in Metafont format, though some are also Type 1 fonts. Also, see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bluesky.com" target="_top">Bluesky</a> who have made available Type 1 versions of the computer modern fonts. (The computer modern fonts are of excellent quality -- to purchase anything of comparable quality and completeness will cost you around $500-. They are comparable to the premium fonts.)</p><p>
					<a class="ulink" href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/originalfonts.html" target="_top">Luc Devroye's webpage</a> has links to several sites with free fonts available. What's unique about these fonts is that a lot of them are really free, they are not ``warez fonts''.</p><p>URW have released the standard PostScript fonts resident in most printers to the public domain. These fonts are quite good.</p><p>The <a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/" target="_top">Walnut Creek Archive</a> has several freely available fonts, and shareware fonts. Some of these are obvious ripoffs (and not very good ones). If a font doesn't come with some kind of license, chances are it's a ripoff. Also <a class="ulink" href="http://www.winsite.com/win3/fonts/atm/" target="_top">Winsite</a> have several Type 1 fonts (in the fonts/atm subsection of their windows 3.x software). Unfortunately, several of these have afm files which have mistakes and are missing all kerning pairs (you can fix the afms by editing the "FontName" section of the afm files. It should match the fontname given in the font shape file. Of course, adding kerning pairs is a topic beyond the scope of this document.)</p><p>
					<a class="ulink" href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/" target="_top">Luc Devroye's webpage</a> includes several free fonts he designed, as well as a lot of links, and fascinating discussion on the topic of typography.

These fonts are the ``standard PostScript fonts'' resident in most PostScript printers. Also the famous Why should I buy the more expensive ones? My take on it is that for a casual user, the value fonts (such as those on the Bitstream CD) are just fine. However, if you're using the fonts for ``real work'', or you're just a hard core font junkie, then the better quality fonts are a must-have -- and most of the quality fonts are either free (for example, Computer Modern), or they are upmarket commercial fonts.</p><p>The advantage of the cheaper fonts is self evident -- they are cheaper. The quality fonts also have their advantages though.

									<span class="emphasis"><em>Ethical issues:</em></span> The cheaper fonts are almost always ripoffs. Type design takes a long time and an experienced designer. Fonts that are sold for less than $1-per font were almost certainly not designed by the vendor. CDs with insane quantities of fonts on the are almost always ripoffs	 (the possible exceptions being collections from major foundries that cost thousands of dollars). Usually, the ripoffs lack the quality of fonts from respectable founries.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
									<span class="emphasis"><em>Completeness:</em></span> The higher quality fonts (notably from Adobe) come in several variants, with some nice supplements to provide the user with a more complete font family. There are often bold, italic, and demibold variants, swash capitals, small caps, old style figures, and extra ligatures to supplement the font. More recently, Adobe have a multiple master technology which gives the user (almost) infinite variation within one font family.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
									<span class="emphasis"><em>Quality:</em></span> A lot of the freely available fonts or the cheap ripoffs lack fairly essential features such as kerning pairs and decent ligatures. They are basically cheap copies. In contrast, reputable designers take a lot of trouble to study the original design, and rework it to the best of their ability.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
									<span class="emphasis"><em>Authenticity:</em></span> The person who designed Adobe Garamond (Robert Slimbach) actually studied the original designs of Claude Garamond. In fact reputable foundries always carefully research their designs, rather than just swiping something off the net, and modifying it with Fontographer.</p></li></ul></div><p>
