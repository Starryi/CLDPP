   Code development consists of mainly Programming languages,
   Debugging tools, Version Management tools, Compiling tools,
   and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) where all
   the above are coupled as a single software application.

    </a>:
     GNU's project to produce a world class optimizing compiler.
     It works on multiple architectures and diverse environments.
     Currently GCC contains front ends for C, C++, Objective C,
     GNU Fortran-95, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these languages
     (libstdc++, libgcj,..).

    <a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/g77/index.html" target="_top">g77
    </a>:
     The GCC front end for FORTRAN 77. It is a very good FORTRAN77
     compiler. It however does not have the -r8 option which compiles
     a program as double precision. This could be a good compiler
     design philosophy but in many cases gives problems when porting
     a code from SUN / DEC / HP workstations onto Linux systems.
     The g77 manual is available at

    I was happy to receive this link by mail. It was 3 years since I had
    migrated to using the GNU C compiler for scientific computing because
    there was no "truly free" FORTRAN-95 compiler available then. I thank
    Paul Thomas for this link.

    fort77 and f2c</a>:
    fort77 is a perl program which invokes the f2c command
     (a Fortran to C translator) transparently, so it can
     be used just like a real Fortran compiler. Fort77 can
     be used to compile Fortran, C and assembler code and
     can link the code with f2c libraries. If you install
     fort77, you'll also need to install the f2c package.
     This does not have the "-r8" problem. You can download
     fort77 and f2c from the above link.

    <a class="ulink" href="http://lush.sourceforge.net" target="_top">lush</a>:
     An object-oriented programming language, which combines the flexibility
     of an interpretive language, with the efficiency of a compiled language.
     It has full interfaces to numerical libraries (GSL, LAPACK, BLAS),
     graphics libraries (OpenGL), which allows creation of graphics and 3D
     animations and many other features that sound too good to be
     true. I have not yet tried this out, but it sounds very promising.

     Scientific Python</a>:
     You may want to explore
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.python.org" target="_top">Python</a> for your
     scientific computing needs. Python is an interpreted,
     interactive, object-oriented programming language.

     It has a number of extensions for numerics, plotting,
     data storage and combined with Tk lets you develop very
     good GUIs for your codes. The most exciting aspect is that
     it simplifies programming because it has modules for almost
     anything (vectors, tensors, transformations, derivatives,
     linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, etc ...) are
     available. You can also wrap C and Fortran libraries from
     Python. Finally if you want to write a numerical scheme of
     your own you may find that it is simpler in Python.
     There are also interfaces to netCDF (portable binary files),
     MPI and BSPlib (parallel programming).

    In this section links are given to mainly debugging tools for GCC and
    FORTRAN. I understand that python has a debugging module built in though I
    have not used it. The purpose of a debugger is to allow you to see what is
    going on inside a program while it executes or what the program was doing
    when/if it crashed.

     A FORTRAN checker designed to detect errors in a Fortran
     program that a compiler usually does not. Therefore it is best
     to run ftnchek on your FORTRAN programs after it has compiled
     without errors. Its purpose is to assist the user in finding
     semantic errors. Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
     language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.
     An on-line <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/~ftnchek/html/" target="_top">

     All programs written in the languages supported by GCC can be

     command line debugger. You can compile your programs using a -g option
     which then compiles your code with debugging information inserted
     into the executable. It can start your programs, stop your programs
     on specified conditions and at specified locations, examine what
     happened when your program stops. In a large code with multiple
     cascading calls to various functions it can back trace the function
     calls. You can also

     CVS is one of the most popular version control systems running on the

     modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Josh MacDonald. PRCS is written and
     maintained by Josh MacDonald.  Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS,

    Integrated development environments (IDEs) can be very useful for
