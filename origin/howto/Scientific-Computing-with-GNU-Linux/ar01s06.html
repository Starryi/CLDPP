  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnuplot.info" target="_top">Gnuplot</a>
 Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting
 utility. It handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces (3
 dimensions). Surfaces can be floating in the 3-d coordinate space,
 or as a contour plot. For 2-d plots, there are also many plot
 styles, including lines, points, lines with points, error bars,
 and impulses. Graphs may be labeled with arbitrary labels and
 arrows, axes labels, a title, date and time, and a key. It has
 multiple plotting capabilities too. It allows saving the graphs in
 various formats which can be included in word processors.
 It can be used to generate publication quality plots.

  <a class="ulink" href="http://ngwww.ucar.edu" target="_top"> NCAR Graphics </a>
 A very popular graphics package which is very well documented and widely
 used. It provides basic ingredients for creating complex plots as
 functions / routines that can be called from Fortran and C. There is
 a contributed programming interface to the NCAR Graphics package:
 NCL (NCAR Command Language). The programming interfaces provide access
 to complex graphics utilities like contouring, world map projections,
 and velocity vectors. For the most part, the C interface is built on
 top of the Fortran interface... It is distributed under the GNU public
 license. Click <a class="ulink" href="http://ngwww.ucar.edu/ngdoc/ng4.2" target="_top">here</a>
 for going to the documentation of all its various components.

  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">OpenDX</a>
  A very good Open Source Data eXplorer. It can handle large amounts of data
  and creates great visualizations. It was the tool I stumbled upon when
  I wanted a free graphics routine to make 3-D plots and zoom-in, rotate,
  and really eXplore the output Data from my codes. The downside is that
  compiling from source is really challenging and getting started is a
  difficult. However it has excellent documentation distributed with it
  and once I started off it was the best tool I have ever used.

 PGPLOT is a Fortran 77 or C callable subroutine package for drawing
 scientific 2D and Simple 3D plots. One can call these routines during
 runtime and redirect the output to a variety of devices at run time.
 It is well documented and the full documentation is available at the
 above site. It is Free for Non-Commercial Use. A user manual is available

 This is a library of scientific plotting functions that can be called from
 C, C++, FORTRAN, TCL, PYTHON. PLplot features as described in the above link
 are, "It can be used to create standard x-y plots, semilog plots,
 log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.
 Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single
 page with multiple lines in each graph. There are almost 2000 characters
 in the extended character set. This includes four different fonts, the
 Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.
 A variety of output devices are supported and new devices can be easily
 added by writing a small number of device dependent routines". To download
