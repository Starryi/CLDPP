   I have not used many of the software applications to which links are provided.
   There are simply too many applications that do the same thing,
   that one cannot be expected to have used all of them. In a book
   on Scientific Computing using GNU/Linux, one would
   mention ones favorite tool to carry out a task and describe it in
   detail. However this is a howto providing links to various
   available free tools for scientific computing and may contain
   links to some software that promises much but delivers little
   and vice versa.
  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="motive"></a>1.3. Motivation</h3></div></div></div><p>
   This howto mainly consists of the links provided at
   http://Scilinux.sourceforge.net which has to be disbanded due to a name
   conflict. The best alternative seems to be to make it a Linux document
   and host it at the LDP site. Another reason is that there seems to be
   many free software applications doing the same things. We hope to provide links to
   the available software thereby making it easy for the scientific community
   to make a choice without spending much time.

  GNU/Linux is probably the platform of choice for scientific
  computing. There exists a wide variety of high level languages,
  debugging tools and other code development tools for
  programming, numerical subroutines for solving various types of
  equations, plotting and visualization packages, word processing
  software which can display equations and figures and in fact parallel
  programming software to construct a supercomputer with off the shelf
  PC parts and some hardware. This document aims to provide a list
  of <span class="emphasis"><em> free software </em></span> for carrying out the above
  tasks and links to tutorials and other documents on how to setup and
  use these software applications.
 </p><p>
  This document does not aim to provide links to subject specific free
  software available for GNU/Linux systems. It aims to show how
  GNU/Linux can be used best to handle scientific computing tasks.
  It is hoped that people or institutions with interest in a
  specific subject list, compile a list of the free software available
  for that subject ... for example see <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux for Astronomy,
  Linux for Biotechnology </em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em> Linux for
  Chemistry </em></span> at
  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.randomfactory.com" target="_top">The Random Factory

   Just installing GNU/Linux on your PC makes it a powerful workstation.
   The various popular distributions however do not have all the tools
   needed to make it the ideal scientific computing machine. This HOWTO
   aims to fill in this gap by creating a list of free software useful
   for scientific computing. It is assumed that people reading this
   document already have a PC with Linux and the GNU utilities installed.
   For those who do not have such a setup and want to install GNU-Linux
   can check out <a class="ulink" href="./GNULinuxWS.html" target="_top">GNU/Linux Systems</a>
   for links to documents on installing GNU/Linux, and also on how to get
   started using GNU/Linux. Recently there has been an effort by Dirk
   Eddelbuettel to create a scientific computing environment
   <a class="ulink" href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html" target="_top">Quantian</a>
   which probably is the first GNU-Linux distribution tailored for
   Scientists. I checked out the latest release and it has almost
   all the packages mentioned in this document and many packages
   not mentioned. It is fair to say that if you have any linux distribution
   in which the packages are managed by rpms or any debian based system,
   you will find pre-compiled binaries of these packages and will not
   have to waste much time installing them.

     compiler. It however does not have the -r8 option which compiles
     a program as double precision. This could be a good compiler
     design philosophy but in many cases gives problems when porting

     be used to compile Fortran, C and assembler code and
     can link the code with f2c libraries. If you install

     It has a number of extensions for numerics, plotting,
     data storage and combined with Tk lets you develop very
     good GUIs for your codes. The most exciting aspect is that
     it simplifies programming because it has modules for almost
     anything (vectors, tensors, transformations, derivatives,
     linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, etc ...) are
     available. You can also wrap C and Fortran libraries from
     Python. Finally if you want to write a numerical scheme of
     your own you may find that it is simpler in Python.
     There are also interfaces to netCDF (portable binary files),

        Supercomputing</h3></div></div></div><p>
  It is possible to get large volume number crunching without
  spending millions of rupees on a supercomputer. You only need
  to link together (by some high speed network) the requisite
  number of CPUs, with GNU/LINUX as the underlying OS. Add
  some freely available message passing software and a effective
  parallel processing number crunching machine is made. Such
  clusters are called "Beowulf clusters". The other advantages
  of such a cluster other than building costs is, up-gradation
  costs are minimal. The two best resources for Linux cluster
  builders are

   Now after reading the above documents, you have an idea of parallel
   processing. Parallel program libraries are the core of parallel processing
   on a Linux cluster. There are various free implementations of parallel
   processing libraries. Since parallel processing is all about performance,
   these libraries have some very nice functional tools to analyze your parallel
   program performance. Given below is a set of links to these parallel
   program libraries and tools.

     KPresenter</a>:
     KPresenter is the presentation tool of the KOffice suite of office

     is used to seeing in costly presentation tools. It also allows honest,
     real scientific presentations where one does not have to impress the
     audience with non subject specific stuff :-). The best thing about it
     is the possibility of saving the presentation as a html file. It makes
     portable network graphics files with each presentation slide. With a
     smattering of knowledge of html files one could put in a animated image
     as a image link thereby allowing one to show movies too when necessary.

    <a class="ulink" href="http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/" target="_top">Xfig </a>:
     Though the man page claims that it is a facility for the
     interactive generation of figures ...., It in fact much more than that.
     Other than generating figures for elucidating what you want to say in
     a poster, it helps you import and export figures in a variety of formats,
     write text in various fonts and sizes, generate Greek symbols and color
     text, Save as latex picture file or any other format supported by your
     word processor for inclusion in your publications, generate GIFs of each
     page of the poster to put on your web site, and finally it generates
     *.fig files which are small in size. The only thing on my wish list for
     xfig is the capability to edit the imported pictures which are not in
     *.fig format. Therefore for a computer screen projected poster
     presentation you need a frames capable browser with contents in one frame
     and the xfig generated posters (exported as *.png or *.jpg from Xfig) on
     the other.
