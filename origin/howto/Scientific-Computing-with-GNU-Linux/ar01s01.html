   I have not used many of the software applications to which links are provided.
   There are simply too many applications that do the same thing,
   that one cannot be expected to have used all of them. In a book
   on Scientific Computing using GNU/Linux, one would
   mention ones favorite tool to carry out a task and describe it in
   detail. However this is a howto providing links to various
   available free tools for scientific computing and may contain
   links to some software that promises much but delivers little
   and vice versa.
  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="motive"></a>1.3. Motivation</h3></div></div></div><p>
   This howto mainly consists of the links provided at
   http://Scilinux.sourceforge.net which has to be disbanded due to a name
   conflict. The best alternative seems to be to make it a Linux document
   and host it at the LDP site. Another reason is that there seems to be
   many free software applications doing the same things. We hope to provide links to
   the available software thereby making it easy for the scientific community
   to make a choice without spending much time.

   Shishir and Ashoka are co-authors of this document because such a
   collection of links was Shishir's idea and Ashoka is always
   contributing by providing links, suggestions and a second point
   of view. They will be helping me maintain this HOWTO too.
