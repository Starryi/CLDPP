It may also help the interested developer in explaining the basics of 
speech recognition programming.   </P
><P
>I started this document when I began researching what speech 
recognition software and development libraries were available for Linux.
Automated Speech Recognition (ASR or just SR) on Linux is just starting 
to come into its own, and I hope this document gives it a push in the 
right direction - by supporting both users and developers of ASR 
technology.</P
><P
>I have left a variety of SR techniques out of this document, and 
instead I have focused on the "HOWTO" aspect (since this is a howto...).
I have included a Publications section so the interested reader can 
find books and articles on anything not covered here.  This is not
meant to be a definitive statement of ASR on Linux.</P

Speech recognition is the process by which a computer (or 
other type of machine) identifies spoken words.  Basically, it means
talking to your computer, AND having it correctly recognize what you 
are saying.</P
><P
>The following definitions are the basics needed for understanding
speech recognition technology.</P
><P
>    <P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Utterance</DT
><DD
><P
>  An utterance is the vocalization (speaking) of a word or words that
  represent a single meaning to the computer.  Utterances can be a 
  single word, a few words, a sentence, or even multiple sentences.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Speaker Dependance</DT
><DD
><P
>  Speaker dependent systems are designed around a specific speaker. 
  They generally are more accurate for the correct speaker, but much 
  less accurate for other speakers.  They assume the speaker will
  speak in a consistent voice and tempo.  Speaker independent systems
  are designed for a variety of speakers.  Adaptive systems usually start
  as speaker independent systems and utilize training techniques to 
  adapt to the speaker to increase their recognition accuracy.  
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Vocabularies</DT
><DD
><P
>  Vocabularies (or dictionaries) are lists of words or utterances that
  can be recognized by the SR system.  Generally, smaller vocabularies 
  are easier for a computer to recognize, while larger vocabularies 
  are more difficult.  Unlike normal dictionaries, each entry doesn't 
  have to be a single word.  They can be as long as a sentence or two.
  Smaller vocabularies can have as few as 1 or 2 recognized utterances
  (e.g."Wake Up"), while very large vocabularies can have a hundred 
  thousand or more!  
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Accuract</DT
><DD
><P
>  The ability of a recognizer can be examined by measuring its 
  accuracy - or how well it recognizes utterances.  This includes not 
  only correctly identifying an utterance but also identifying if the
  spoken utterance is not in its vocabulary.  Good ASR systems have an
  accuracy of 98% or more!  The acceptable accuracy of a system 
  really depends on the application.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Training</DT
><DD
><P
>  Some speech recognizers have the ability to adapt to a speaker.  
  When the system has this ability, it may allow training to take 
  place.  An ASR system is trained by having the speaker repeat
  standard or common phrases and adjusting its comparison algorithms
  to match that particular speaker.  Training a recognizer usually 
  improves its accuracy.
            </P
><P
>  Training can also be used by speakers that have difficulty 
  speaking, or pronouncing certain words.  As long as the speaker
  can consistently repeat an utterance, ASR systems with training
  should be able to adapt.

NAME="TYPES"
>3.2. Types of Speech Recognition</A
></H3
><P
> 
Speech recognition systems can be separated in several different
classes by describing what types of utterances they have the ability
to recognize.  These classes are based on the fact that one of the 
difficulties of ASR is the ability to determine when a speaker starts
and finishes an utterance. Most packages can fit into more than one 
class, depending on which mode they're using.</P
><P
>    <P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Isolated Words</DT
><DD
><P
>  Isolated word recognizers usually require each utterance to have
  quiet (lack of an audio signal) on BOTH sides of the sample window.
  It doesn't mean that it accepts single words, but does require
  a single utterance at a time.  Often, these systems have 
  "Listen/Not-Listen" states, where they require the speaker to wait
  between utterances (usually doing processing during the pauses).
  Isolated Utterance might be a better name for this class.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Connected Words</DT
><DD
><P
>  Connect word systems (or more correctly 'connected utterances')
  are similar to Isolated words, but allow separate utterances to be
  'run-together' with a minimal pause between them.
              </P
></DD
><DT
>Continuous Speech</DT
><DD
><P
>  Continuous recognition is the next step.  Recognizers with continuous
  speech capabilities are some of the most difficult to create because
  they must utilize special methods to determine utterance boundaries.
  Continuous speech recognizers allow users to speak almost naturally, 
  while the computer determines the content.  Basically, it's computer 
  dictation.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Spontaneous Speech</DT
><DD
><P
>  There appears to be a variety of definitions for what spontaneous 
  speech actually is.   At a basic level, it can be thought of as 
  speech that is natural sounding and not rehearsed.  An ASR system
  with spontaneous speech ability should be able to handle a variety
  of natural speech features such as words being run together, "ums"
  and "ahs", and even slight stutters.
            </P

Although any task that involves interfacing with a computer can
potentially use ASR, the following applications are the most 
common right now.</P

>Dictation</DT
><DD
><P
>  Dictation is the most common use for ASR systems today.  This 
  includes medical transcriptions, legal and business dictation, as
  well as general word processing.  In some cases special vocabularies
  are used to increase the accuracy of the system.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Command and Control</DT
><DD
><P
>  ASR systems that are designed to perform functions and actions on the
  system are defined as Command and Control systems.  Utterances like
  "Open Netscape" and "Start a new xterm" will do just that.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Telephony</DT
><DD
><P
>  Some PBX/Voice Mail systems allow callers to speak commands instead of
  pressing buttons to send specific tones.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Wearables</DT
><DD
><P
>  Because inputs are limited for wearable devices, speaking is a 
  natural possibility.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Medical/Disabilities</DT
><DD
><P
>  Many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such
  as repetitive strain injuries (RSI), muscular dystrophy, and
  many others.  For example, people with difficulty hearing could use
  a system connected to their telephone to convert the caller's speech
  to text.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Embedded Applications</DT
><DD
><P
>  Some newer cellular phones include C&#38;C speech recognition that allow
  utterances such as "Call Home".  This could be a major factor in the
  future of ASR and Linux.   Why can't I talk to my television yet?

><P
> 
Because speech requires a relatively low bandwidth, just about any
medium-high quality 16 bit sound card will get the job done.  You must
have sound enabled in your kernel, and you must have correct drivers 
installed.  For more information on sound cards, please see "The Linux
Sound HOWTO" available at: http://www.LinuxDoc.org/.  Sound card 
quality often starts a heated discussion about their impact on accuracy
and noise.  </P
><P
>Sound cards with the 'cleanest' A/D (analog to digital) conversions 
are recommended, but most often the clarity of the digital sample is 
more dependent on the microphone quality and even more dependent on the
environmental noise.  Electrical "noise" from monitors, pci slots,
hard-drives, etc. are usually nothing compared to audible noise
from the computer fans, squeaking chairs, or heavy breathing.</P
><P
>Some ASR software packages may require a specific sound card.  It's
usually a good idea to stay away from specific hardware requirements,
because it limits many of your possible future options and decisions.
You'll have to weigh the benefits and costs if you are considering
packages that require specific hardware to function properly.</P

><P
>A quality microphone is key when utilizing ASR.  In most cases, a 
desktop microphone just won't do the job.  They tend to pick up more
ambient noise that gives ASR programs a hard time.</P
><P
>Hand held microphones are also not the best choice as they can be 
cumbersome to pick up all the time.  While they do limit the amount
of ambient noise, they are most useful in applications that require
changing speakers often, or when speaking to the recognizer isn't
done frequently (when wearing a headset isn't an option).</P
><P
>  
The best choice, and by far the most common is the headset style.  
It allows the ambient noise to be minimized, while allowing you to 
have the microphone at the tip of your tongue all the time.  Headsets
are available without earphones and with earphones (mono or stereo). 
I recommend the stereo headphones, but it's just a matter of personal
taste.</P
><P
>You can get excellent quality microphone headsets for between $25
$100.  A good place to start looking is http://www.headphones.com or 
http://www.speechcontrol.com.</P
><P
>  
  A quick note about levels:  Don't forget to turn up your microphone
volume.  This can be done with a program such as XMixer or OSS Mixer
and care should be used to avoid feedback noise.  If the ASR software
includes auto-adjustment programs, use them instead, as they are 
optimized for their particular recognition system.</P

>ASR applications can be heavily dependent on processing speed.  This
is because a large amount of digital filtering and signal processing 
can take place in ASR.</P
><P
>As with just about any cpu intensive software, the faster the better.
Also, the more memory the better.  It's possible to do some SR with 100MHz
and 16M RAM, but for fast processing (large dictionaries, complex
recognition schemes, or high sample rates), you should shoot for a 
minimum of a 400MHz and 128M RAM.  Because of the processing required,
most software packages list their minimum requirements.</P

efforts hasn't yet been undertaken.  If you know of any project underway,

>6.1. How Recognizers Work</A
></H3
><P
> 
Recognition systems can be broken down into two main types.  Pattern
Recognition systems compare patterns to known/trained patterns to
determine a match.  Acoustic Phonetic systems use knowledge of the
human body (speech production, and hearing) to compare speech features
(phonetics such as vowel sounds).  Most modern systems focus on the
pattern recognition approach because it combines nicely with current
computing techniques and tends to have higher accuracy.</P

        </P

><P

Although each step seems simple, each one can involve a multitude of
different (and sometimes completely opposite) techniques. </P
><P
>(1) Audio/Utterance Recording: can be accomplished in a number of ways.  
Starting points can be found by comparing ambient audio levels (acoustic
energy in some cases) with the sample just recorded.  Endpoint detection
is harder because speakers tend to leave "artifacts" including 
breathing/sighing,teeth chatters, and echoes. </P
><P
>(2) Pre-Filtering: is accomplished in a variety of ways, depending on 
other features of the recognition system.  The most common methods are 
the "Bank-of-Filters" method which utilizes a series of audio filters to
prepare the sample, and the Linear Predictive Coding method which uses 
a prediction function to calculate differences (errors).  Different
forms of spectral analysis are also used.</P
><P
>(3) Framing/Windowing involves separating the sample data into 
specific sizes.  This is often rolled into step 2 or step 4.  This step
also involves preparing the sample boundaries for analysis (removing 
edge clicks, etc.)</P
><P
>(4) Additional Filtering is not always present.  It is the final 
preparation for each window before comparison and matching.  Often this
consists of time alignment and normalization.</P
><P
>There are a huge number of techniques available for (5), Comparison 
and Matching.  Most involve comparing the current window with known 
samples.  There are methods that use Hidden Markov Models (HMM), 
frequency analysis, differential analysis, linear algebra 
techniques/shortcuts, spectral distortion,  and time distortion methods.
All these methods are used to generate a probability and accuracy match.</P
><P
>(6) Actions can be just about anything the developer wants. *GRIN*</P

NAME="DIGITALAUDIO"
>6.2. Digital Audio Basics</A
></H3
><P
>Audio is inherently an analog phenomenon.  Recording a digital sample
is done by converting the analog signal from the microphone to an 
digital signal through the A/D converter in the sound card.  When a
microphone is operating, sound waves vibrate the magnetic element in
the microphone, causing an electrical current to the sound card (think 
of a speaker working in reverse).  Basically, the A/D converter records
the value of the electrical voltage at specific intervals.</P
><P
>There are two important factors during this process.  First is the
"sample rate", or how often to record the voltage values.  Second, is
the "bits per sample", or how accurate the value is recorded.  A third
item is the number of channels (mono or stereo), but for most ASR 
applications mono is sufficient.  Most applications use pre-set values
for these parameters and user's shouldn't change them unless the 
documentation suggests it.  Developers should experiment with different
values to determine what works best with their algorithms.</P
><P
>So what is a good sample rate for ASR?  Because speech is relatively
low bandwidth (mostly between 100Hz-8kHz), 8000 samples/sec (8kHz) is 
sufficient for most basic ASR.  But, some people prefer 16000 
samples/sec (16kHz) because it provides more accurate high frequency
information.  If you have the processing power, use 16kHz.  For most
ASR applications, sampling rates higher than about 22kHz is a waste.</P
><P
>And what is a good value for "bits per sample"?  8 bits per sample
will record values between 0 and 255, which means that the position
of the microphone element is in one of 256 positions.  16 bits per
sample divides the element position into 65536 possible values.
Similar to sample rate, if you have enough processing power and
memory, go with 16 bits per sample.  For comparison, an audio
Compact Disc is encoded with 16 bits per sample at about 44kHz.</P
><P
>The encoding format used should be simple - linear signed or 
unsigned.  Using a U-Law/A-Law algorithm or some other compression 
scheme is usually not worth it, as it will cost you in computing power,
and not gain you much.</P
