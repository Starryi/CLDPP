The traditional means of troubleshooting computer-related problems 
involves consulting user's manuals, books, friends - probably enticed 
with goodies - and, when all the former do not yield a solution, calling 
the technical support service of the vendor of the product in question. 
And, we all know pleasant and reliably efficacious the latter stratagem 
is. Unfortunately, this is the norm in the sphere of commercial 
proprietary products.

</p><p>

In contradistinction, Linux, and related distributions, utilities and 
applications software, have largely been developed according to the 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source</a> model, 
wherein developers have used electronic communication over the Internet 
- typically in the form of publicly-accessible Mailing Lists - to 
collaborate with their peers in the refinement of the associated source 
code. Such collaboration has also traditionally involved the online 
publication of user's manuals, lists of Frequently-Asked-Questions 
(FAQ's), knowledge bases, release notes, formal guides such as this 
document (HOWTO's) and tutorials. In addition, users often assist others 
through the forum of Usenet and other newsgroups and the posted messages 
are readily accessible in the form of searchable archives. These 
Linux-related newsgroups are renowned for their high level of user 
participation. In significant measure, Linux may be considered a product 
of the Internet.

</p><p>

Considered together, these resources enable access to a large, 
ever-expanding factual database, and my intent is to encourage and 
direct the reader to utilize these repositories when faced with an issue 
not addressed in the documentation that is included with each 
distribution of Linux. Linux veterans who assist newcomers through the 
forum of Usenet soon become aware of the frequency with which certain 
technical questions are repeatedly posted - questions the answers to 
which are readily available in one or more of the existent online 
repositories. So, to diminish the likelihood of being "flamed" in 
response to your posted question on Usenet or irc, read further!

Armed with a browser, Linux users may rapidly become adept at 
troubleshooting their systems. The key is knowing how and where to look. 
My objective is to guide the user - particularly the Linux newbie - in 
this quest.
