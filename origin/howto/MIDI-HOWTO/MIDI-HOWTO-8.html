<P>Interest in Linux based MIDI is growing and this list will probably not reflect the true amount of MIDI software available, but should provide a reasonable selection of applications.</P>
<P>If you are developing, or know of, any other MIDI apps not listed here please drop me a note.</P>

</H2>



<H3>Alsa Driver</H3>


<P>The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture is composed of several parts. The first is a fully modularized sound driver which supports module autoloading, devfs, isapnp autoconfiguration, and gives complete access to analog audio, digital audio, control, mixer, synthesizer, DSP, MIDI, and timer components of audio hardware. It also includes a fully-featured kernel-level sequencer, a full compatibility layer for OSS/Free applications, an object-oriented C library which covers and enhances the ALSA kernel driver functionality for applications (client/server, plugins, PCM sharing/multiplexing, PCM metering, etc.), an interactive configuration program for the driver, and some simple utilities for basic management. </P>

<H3>OSS</H3>


<P>OSS provides sound card drivers for most popular sound cards under Linux and FreeBSD. These drivers support digital audio, MIDI, synthesizers, and mixers found on sound cards. These sound drivers comply with the Open Sound System API specification. OSS provides a user-friendly GUI which makes the installation of sound drivers and configuration of sound cards very simple. It supports over 200 brand name sound cards, and provides automatic sound card detection, Plug-n-Play support, support for PCI audio soundcards, and support for full duplex audio. </P>

of limitations that other software &amp; hardware synthesizers have. There are no limits to the amount
of oscillators or filters one can use. Csound is also completely modular, so that any function in
Csound can be used in an array of ways.</P>

<H3>sfront</H3>


<P>Sfront compiles MPEG 4 Structured Audio (MP4-SA) bitstreams into efficient C programs that generate audio when executed. MP4-SA is a standard for normative algorithmic sound, that combines an audio signal processing language (SAOL) with score languages (SASL, and the legacy MIDI File Format). Under Linux, sfront supports real-time, low-latency audio input/output, local MIDI input from soundcards, and networked MIDI input using RTP and SIP. A SIP server hosted on the Berkeley campus manages sessions. The website includes an online book about MP4-SA. </P>

<H3>jMax</H3>


<P>jMax allows one to interactively design dataflow circuits. The basic data types that can go through are integers, symbols, lists, etc. It is an event-driven system and has been used for MIDI processing. A second part of the system (DSP) allows a continuous signal to flow through a circuit, which is most useful for PCM sound (ie. microphone, sound files, etc). The system is extensible by using shared libraries, you may add data processor types, data types, GUI elements, device types, and more. Data processors may also be designed as circuits and reused. </P>

<H3>TSE3</H3>


<P>TSE3 is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. It is a 'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of a sequencer but provides no form of user interface.  Sequencer applications or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://TSE3.sourceforge.net/">http://TSE3.sourceforge.net/</A></P>

<H3>KeyKit</H3>


<P>KeyKit is a multi-tasking interpreted programming language (inspired by awk) designed exclusively for realtime and algorithmic MIDI manipulation. KeyKit's GUI provides several dozen tools for algorithmic music experimentation, including a multi-track sequencer and drum pattern editor. The GUI and all tools are completely written in the KeyKit language itself. This allows users to add new tools and operations to the existing tools, even while the system is running.</P>
