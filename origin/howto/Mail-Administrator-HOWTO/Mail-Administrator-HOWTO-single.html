<HR>
<EM>This document describes the setup, care and feeding of Electronic Mail (e-mail)
under Linux.
It is primarily intended for administrators, rather than users.  (See
the Mail-User's-HOWTO for information on user issues and user agents.)
You need to read this if you plan to communicate locally or to remote
sites via electronic mail.
You probably do <EM>*not*</EM> need to read this document if don't
exchange electronic mail with other users on your system or with other
sites.</EM>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Email and spamming </A>
</H2>


<P>To send mail to anyone mentioned in this document, convert "at" in
email addresses to "@".</P>
<P>This conversion is simple for humans, but not spammers' address
harvesters; therefore it's useful to protect generous contributors
from being spammed!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Goals </A>
</H2>


<P>The intent of this document is to answer some of the questions and comments
that appear to meet the definition of "frequently asked questions" about e-mail
software under Linux in general and the version in the Linux Debian and
RedHat distributions in particular.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 New versions </A>
</H2>


<P>New versions of this document will be periodically posted to
comp.os.linux.announce, comp.answers and mail.answers.  They will
also be added to the various anonymous ftp sites who archive such
information including <EM>sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO</EM>.</P>
<P>In addition, you should be generally able to find this document on the
Linux WorldWideWeb home page at <EM>http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html</EM>.</P>

of this document via e-mail.  Definitely contact me if you find errors or
obvious omissions.</P>
<P>I read, but do not necessarily respond to, all e-mail I receive.  Requests for
enhancements will be considered and acted upon based on that day's combination
of available time, merit of the request and daily blood pressure :-)</P>
<P>Flames will quietly go to /dev/null so don't bother.</P>

<P>There is nothing special about configuring and running mail software under
Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do <EM>NOT</EM> want
to be posting generic mail-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*

<P>Don't post in comp.os.linux hierarchy unless it's really linux specific, for
example : "Which options was Debian 1.2 sendmail compiled with ?" or "RedHat
5.0 smail crashes when I run it".</P>
<P>Let me repeat that.</P>
<P>There is virtually no reason to post anything mail-related in the
comp.os.linux hierarchy any more.  There are existing newsgroups in the
comp.mail.* hierarchy to handle *ALL* your questions.</P>
<P><EM>IF YOU POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.* FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, YOU ARE
LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR HELP.  THE MAIL EXPERTS HANG OUT IN THE PLACES

<P>The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"<CODE>Managing UUCP and USENET</CODE>" from O'Reilly and Associates is in my
opinion the best book out there for figuring out the programs and protocols
involved in being a USENET site.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>Unix Communications</CODE>" from The Waite Group contains a nice
description of all the pieces (and more) and how they fit together.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>Sendmail</CODE>" from O'Reilly and Associates looks to be the
definitive reference on sendmail-v8 and sendmail+IDA.  It's a "must have" for
anybody hoping to make sense out of sendmail without bleeding in the process.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>The Internet Complete Reference</CODE>" from Osborne is a fine
reference book that explains the various services available on Internet and is
a great source for information on news, mail and various other Internet
resources.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>The Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</CODE>" from Olaf
Kirch of the Linux Documentation Project is available on the net and is
also published by (at least) O'Reilly and SSC.

It makes a fine one-stop shop to learn about everything you ever
imagined you'd need to know about Unix networking.

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. How Electronic Mail Works</A></H2>

<P>Now we'll explain the flow of information that typically takes place when
two people to communicate by email.  Let us suppose that 
Alice, on her machine <CODE>wonderland.com</CODE>, wants to send mail to
Bob, on his machine <CODE>dobbs.com</CODE>.  Both machines are connected
to the Internet.</P>
<P>It helps to know that an Internet mail message consists of two parts;
mail headers and a mail body, separated by a blank
line.  The mail headers contain the source and destination of the
mail, a user-supplied subject line, the date it was sent, and various
other kinds of useful information.  The body is the actual content
of the message.  Here's an example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
From: "Alice" &lt;alice@wonderland.com>
Message-Id: &lt;199711131704.MAA18447@wonderland.com>
Subject: Have you seen my white rabbit?
To: bob@dobbs.org (Bob)
Date: Thu, 13 Nov 1997 12:04:05 -0500 (EST)

I'm most concerned.  I fear he may have fallen down a hole.

</P>
<P>To send mail, Alice will invoke a program called a mail user agent
(or MUA for short).  The MUA is what users think of as `the
mailer'; it helps her compose the message, usually by calling out to a
text editor of her choice.  When she hits the MUA `send' button, her
part of the process is done.  Later in this HOWTO we will survey
popular MUAs.</P>
<P>The MUA she uses immediately hands her message to a program called a
mail transport agent (or MTA). Usually this
program will be <CODE>sendmail</CODE>, though some alternative MTAs are
gaining popularity and may appear in future Linux distributions.  Later
in this HOWTO we will also survey MTAs.</P>
<P>The MTA's job is to pass the mail to an MTA on Bob's machine.  It
determines Bob's machine by analyzing the To header and seeing the
<CODE>dobbs.com</CODE> on the right-hand side of Bob's address.  It uses
that address to open an Internet connection to Bob's machine.  The
mechanics of making that connection are a whole other topic; for this 
explanation, it's enough to know that the connection is a way for
Alice's MTA to send text commands to Bob's machine and receive replies
to those commands.</P>
<P>The MTA's commands don't go to a shell.  Instead they go to a service port on Alice's machine.  A service port is a sort of
rendezvous, a known place where Internet service programs listen for
incoming requests.  Service ports are numbered, and Alice's MTA knows
that it needs to talk to port 25 on Bob's machine to pass mail.</P>
<P>On port 25, Bob's machine has its own MTA listening for commands
(probably another copy of sendmail).  Alice's MTA will go through
a dialogue with Bob's using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(or SMTP).  Here is what an SMTP dialogue looks like.
Lines sent by Alice's machine are shown with S:, responses from
Bob's machine are shown with R:.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
      S: MAIL FROM:&lt;alice@wonderland.com>
      R: 250 OK
      S: RCPT TO:&lt;bob@dobbs.com>
      R: 250 OK
      S: DATA
      R: 354 Start mail input; end with &lt;CRLF>.&lt;CRLF>
      S: From: "Alice" &lt;alice@wonderland.com>
      S: Message-Id: &lt;199711131704.MAA18447@wonderland.com>
      S: Subject: Have you seen my white rabbit?
      S: To: bob@dobbs.org (Bob)
      S: Date: Thu, 13 Nov 1997 12:04:05 -0500 (EST)
      S: Content-Type: text
      S: 
      S: I'm most concerned.  I fear he may have fallen down a hole.
      S: -- 
      S:                                                 >>alice>>
      S: .
      R: 250 OK
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Usually an SMTP command is a single text line and so is its response.
The DATA command is an exception; after seeing that, the SMTP listener
accepts message lines until it sees a period on a line by itself.
(SMTP is defined by the Internet standard 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc821.txt">RFC821</A>.)</P>
<P>Now Bob's MTA has Alice's message.  It will add a header to the
message that looks something like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
Received: (from alice@wonderland.com)
        by mail.dobbs.com (8.8.5/8.8.5) id MAA18447
        for bob@dobbs.com; Thu, 13 Nov 1997 12:04:05 -0500
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This is for tracking purposes in case of mail errors (sometimes a
message has to be relayed through more than one machine and will have
several of these).  Bob's MTA will pass the modified message to a
local delivery agent or LDA.  On Linux systems
the LDA is usually a program called <CODE>procmail</CODE>, though others
exist.</P>
<P>The LDA's job is to append the message to Bob's mailbox.  It's
separate from the MTA so that both programs can be simpler, and
so the MTA can concentrate on doing Internet things without
worrying about local details like where the user mailboxes live.</P>
<P>Bob's mailbox will normally be a file called /usr/spool/mail/bob
or /var/mail/bob.  When he reads mail, he runs his own MUA (mail
user agent) to look at and edit that file.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Notifiers</A>
</H2>

<P>There's yet another kind of program that is important in the mail
chain, though it does not itself read or transmit mail.  It's 
a <EM>mail notifier</EM>, a program that watches your email in-box
for activity and signals you when new mail is present.</P>
<P>The original notifier was a pair of Unix programs called biff(1) and
comsat(8). The biff program is a front end that enables you to turn on the
comsat service.  When this service is on, the header of new 
mail will be dumped to your terminal as it arrived.  This facility
was designed for people using line-oriented programs on CRTs; it's
not really a good idea in today's environment.</P>
<P>Most Unix shells have built-in mailcheck facilities that allow them to
function as notifiers in a rather less intrusive way (by emitting a
message just before the prompt when new mail is detected).  Typically
you can enable this by setting environment variables documented on the
shell's manual page.  For shells in the sh/ksh/bash family, see the
MAIL and MAILPATH variables</P>
<P>Systems supporting X come with one of several little desktop gadgets
that check for new mail periodically and give you both visible and
audible indication of new mail.  The oldest and most widely used of
these is called <EM>xbiff</EM>; if your Linux has a preconfigured X desktop
setup, xbiff is probably on it.  See the xbiff(1) manual page for
details.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Mail to part-time Internet machines</A>
</H2>

<P>If you were reading carefully, you may have noticed that the
information flow we described above depends on Alice's machine 
being able to talk to Bob's machine immediately.  What happens
if Bob's machine is down, or is up but not connected to the
Internet?</P>
<P>If Alice's MTA can't reach Bob's immediately, it will stash Alice's
message in a mail queue on <CODE>wonderland.com</CODE>.  It will
then retry sending the mail at intervals until an expiration time is
reached, at which point a bounce message notifying Alice
of the failure will be sent back to her.  In the default configuration
of the most popular MTA (sendmail), the retry interval is 15 minutes and the 
expiration time is 4 days.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Remote mail and remote-mail protocols</A>
</H2>

<P>Many Linux users nowadays are connected to the Internet via ISPs
(Internet Service Providers) and don't have their own Internet
domains.  Instead they have accounts on an ISP machine.
Their mail gets delivered to a mailbox on that ISP machine.  But
typically these users want to read and reply to their mail using their
own machines, which connect to the ISP intermittently using
SLIP or PPP.  Linux supports remote mail
protocols to support this.</P>
<P>Note how this is different from the scenario we discussed in the
last section.  Mail sitting in a queue awaiting retransmission is not
the same as mail dispatched to a server mailbox; mail in a queue is
not considered to have been delivered and is subject to expiration,
but mail delivered to an ISP server mailbox <EM>is</EM> considered
`delivered' and can sit there indefinitely.</P>
<P>A remote-mail protocol allows mail on a server to be pulled across a
network link by a client program (this is the opposite of normal
delivery in which an MTA pushes mail to a receiving MTA).  There are
two remote-mail protocols in common use; POP3 (defined by the Internet
standard 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1939.txt">RFC1939</A>)
and IMAP (defined by the Internet
standard 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2060.txt">RFC2060</A>).
Effectively all ISPs support POP3; a growing number support IMAP (which
is more powerful).</P>
<P>Here is what an example POP3 session looks like:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
      S: &lt;client connects to service port 110>
      R:    +OK POP3 server ready &lt;1896.697170952@mailgate.dobbs.org>
      S:    USER bob
      R:    +OK bob
      S:    PASS redqueen
      R:    +OK bob's maildrop has 2 messages (320 octets)
      S:    STAT
      R:    +OK 2 320
      S:    LIST
      R:    +OK 2 messages (320 octets)
      R:    1 120
      R:    2 200
      R:    .
      S:    RETR 1
      R:    +OK 120 octets
      R:    &lt;the POP3 server sends message 1>
      R:    .
      S:    DELE 1
      R:    +OK message 1 deleted
      S:    RETR 2
      R:    +OK 200 octets
      R:    &lt;the POP3 server sends message 2>
      R:    .
      S:    DELE 2
      R:    +OK message 2 deleted
      S:    QUIT
      R:    +OK dewey POP3 server signing off (maildrop empty)
      S:  &lt;client hangs up>
</PRE>
</P>
<P>An IMAP session uses different commands and responses, but is
logically very similar.</P>

<P>To take advantage of POP3 or IMAP, you need a remote mail
client program to pull your mail.  Some mail user agents have
client capabilities built in (which one supports which is noted
below), and the Netscape browser's mail facility supports both POP and
IMAP natively.</P>
<P>The main drawback of POP client facilities built into MUAs is that you
have to explicitly tell your mailer to poll the server; you don't get
notified by xbiff(1) or equivalent, as you would for mail that is
either local or delivered by a conventional SMTP `push' connection.
Also, of course, not all MUAs can do POP/IMAP, so you may find
yourself compromising on other features.</P>
<P>Your Linux probably comes with a program called 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/fetchmail">fetchmail</A> that is designed
specifically to talk to remote-mail servers, fetch mail, and feed it
into your normal mail delivery path by speaking SMTP to your listener.</P>
<P>Unless you need to keep your mail on the server (for example, because
you move around between client machines a lot) fetchmail is probably a
better solution than whatever POP/IMAP features your user agent has.
Fetchmail can be told to run in background and poll your server
periodically, so your xbiff(1) or other mail-notifier program will
work as it would for SMTP mail.  Also, fetchmail is rather more
tolerant of various idiosyncracies and nonstandard server quirks than
the clients in MUAs, and has better error recovery.</P>
<P>Here's a diagram showing how both cases (with and without fetchmail) work:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Mailbox formats</A>
</H2>

<P>When incoming mail gets appended to a mailbox, it's up to the MTA 
to provide some kind of delimiters that tell where one message stops
and the next begins. </P>
<P>Under Unix, the convention almost all mailers use is that each line
beginning with ``From '' (the space is significant) begins a new
message.  If ``From '' occurs at the beginning of a line in text, a
Unix MTA will generally prefix it with a greater-than sign, so it looks
like ``>From ''.  RFC822 headers follow this From line (which usually
continues with the sender name and receipt date).</P>
<P>This convention originated with Unix Version 7, so this kind of
mailbox is referred to as a ``V7 mailbox''; it is also sometimes
called ``mbox format''.  Unless otherwise noted, all programs
mentioned in this HOWTO expect this format.  It is not, however, quite
universal, and tools expecting and generating different formats can
confuse each other badly.</P>
<P>The four other formats to know about (and beware of!) are BABYL, 
MMDF, MH, and qmail maildir.  Of these, MMDF is the simplest; 
it uses a delimiter line consisting four control-As (ASCII 001) 
characters followed by CR-LF.  MMDF was an early and rather 
crude Internet mail transport; a descendant is still in use on
SCO systems.</P>
<P>BABYL is another survival, from an early mail system at MIT.  It is
still used by Emacs's mail-reader mode.</P>
<P>MH and qmail maildir are `mailbox' formats which actually burst 
each mailbox into a directory of files, one per message.  Running
grep on such a `mailbox' will get you nowhere, since all grep will
see are the directory bits.</P>
<P>Microsoft Outlook Express .mbx mailboxes can be converted to 
RFC822 format with mbx2mbox app.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Requirements</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Hardware </A>
</H2>


<P>There are no specific hardware requirements for mail under Linux.</P>
<P>You'll need some sort of 'transport' software to connect to remote systems,
which means either TCP/IP or uucp.</P>
<P>This could mean that you need a modem or ethernet card, depending on your setup. 
In most cases, you'll want the fastest modem you can afford, i.e. V90 57 600
bps currently.  In general, you want to have a 16550 UART on your serial board
or built into your modem to handle speeds of above 9600 baud.</P>
<P>If you don't know what that last sentence means, please consult the
<CODE>comp.dcom.modems</CODE> group or the various fine modem and serial
communications FAQs and periodic postings on USENET.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Choosing a Mail Transport Agent</A></H2>

<P>Mail transport agents are the software that transfers mail from your
local system to remote systems.  It is very seldom necessary to mess
with or replace your MTA on a modern Linux, and you're better off not
fixing what isn't broken.  Nevertheless, here's a survey to get you
started on understanding what the tradeoffs are if you decide you need
more security or performance than your system's default can offer.</P>
<P>(There are other Unix MTAs besides these, but you are quite unlikely
to encounter them on a Linux box.)</P>
<P>Each has its own unique features, but the best compromise is qmail. It
features high security (even if vmail is more secure), high speed
(even if smail is faster for local uses) and ease of configuration.
Of course, feel free to choose any mail software. The information
provided here is intended to help you choose well.</P>
<P>Sendmail can be nice for many sites with complicated options, but I think its
configuration is too hard for beginners while it is not very secure or very
fast, so there is only a <B>really</B> outdated sendmail section in this HOWTO.</P>
<P>If you know what you're doing, choose sendmail (and you shouldn't be
reading this HOWTO!); otherwise I generally recommend qmail.</P>
<P>Detailed descriptions of these programs follow.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 sendmail</A>
</H2>

<P>BSD sendmail is the grandaddy of Internet MTAs.  It has outlasted a few
would-be successors.  Most Linux distributions now use it and have it
preinstalled.</P>

<P>Sendmail has a long-standing reputation for being an administrator's
nightmare -- hard to understand, tricky to configure, rife with
security holes.  As Internet technology and standards have stabilized,
however, many of the sendmail options and configurable rules that gave
rise to this reputation have ceased to require per-site tweaking
(the effective demise of non-TCP/IP network layers like UUCP has
helped a lot).  Also, recent sendmail versions have an improved
configuration system that insulates you from the legendary hideousness
of the sendmail.cf configuration file.  Most importantly, sendmail now
normally comes preconfigured, and you should never need to touch it
unless you have unusual requirements (such as needing to route mail
over a non-TCP/IP network).</P>

<P>There is a sendmail home page at 
<A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org">http://www.sendmail.org</A>.
It includes references to extensive documentation of sendmail, should
you actually need to wrestle with custom-configuring it.</P>

<P>Other MTAs, if called as `sendmail', may mimic the semantics of
sendmail's command-line options.  This is convenient for mail user
agents, which often assume they are talking to sendmail.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 smail v3.2</A>
</H2>

<P>Smail was the first serious attempt to replace sendmail.  It has a
simpler and much more comprehensible configuration system than
sendmail's, and it's fairly secure.  Some Linux distributions
preinstall it rather than sendmail.</P>

<P>At one time smail's excellent support for mixed TCP/IP and UUCP sites
was a major selling point for it, but as UUCP has declined, so has
smail.  Also, smail is less efficient than sendmail on high-volume
connections.</P>

<P>As with sendmail, it is unlikely that you will need to tweak a
preinstalled smail configuration.</P>

<P>(Very occasionally you might run across references to an `smail 2.5'.
This program has been obsolete for a long time.  Don't bother with it.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 qmail</A>
</H2>

<P>The qmail program is a sendmail-compatible MTA designed specifically
for high security.  The author has a standing reward of $500 for
publication of the first verifiable security hole; this reward has gone
unclaimed since March 1997.</P>
<P>The qmail home page is at 
<A HREF=" http://pobox.com/~djb/qmail.html"> http://pobox.com/~djb/qmail.html</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 exim</A>
</H2>

<P>The exim program is similar to smail3, but with more features.  It
advertises particular strengths in spam-blocking and support of several
virtual hosts (virtual DNS domains) on the same host.</P>
<P>The exim home page is at 
<A HREF=" http://www.exim.org/"> http://www.exim.org/</A>.</P>
<P>I tried it on my own computer, it looks like a nice merge between
smail configuration system and qmail security, moreover it has the
advantage of being GPL.</P>
<P>A section explaining how to replace your current MTA by exim will be
added soon.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Installing Transport Software</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Qmail v1.03</A>
</H2>


<P>Secured, fast and easy to use, this is my preferred MTA (mail transport agent).</P>
<P>Currently, no distribution comes with qmail preinstalled.  We will
focus on compiling and installing qmail, since this is the only tricky
part: configuration is really straightforward.</P>

<H3>Getting qmail </H3>


<P>Go to www.qmail.org to download the latest version.</P>

<H3>Uncompressing sources </H3>


<P>Then decompress it by running:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mv qmail.tar.gz /usr/local/src
cd /usr/local/src ; tar -zxvf qmail.tar.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you find a bz2 version (new and better compression format), just
replace tar with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
bunzip2 qmail.tar.bz2
tar -xvf qmail.tar
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>Preparing for compilation </H3>


<P>Now enter the qmail directory to examine the configuration defaults:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd qmail; more conf-*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You shouldn't need to change any defaults, but you could (for example)
specify an alternate installation directory or better compilation
flags.</P>
<P>Now run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mkdir /var/qmail
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to create target dir.</P>
<P>If you haven't installed a Debian distribution, you'll need to add several user
IDs for qmail's use: qmail's high security depends on that.</P>
<P>The fact that qmail is divided into modules running each under their
own UID makes it much harder for an intruder to break your whole mail
system or gain root access by abusing it.</P>
<P>So run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   # groupadd nofiles
   # useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail/alias alias
   # useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail qmaild
   # useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail qmaill
   # useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail qmailp
   # groupadd qmail
   # useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail qmailq
   # useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail qmailr
   # useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail qmails
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>or hand-edit <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/group</CODE> to add these users
by yourself.</P>
<P>Evan E. reported he had to use "-g groupid" parameter for a vanilla
groupadd (Caldera 1.2), else groupadd reported this error :
"A group with that name already exists."</P>
<P>For example you can respectively add:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        qmail:*:2107:
        nofiles:*:2108:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>&amp;</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        alias:*:7790:2108::/var/qmail/alias:/bin/true
        qmaild:*:7791:2108::/var/qmail:/bin/true
        qmaill:*:7792:2108::/var/qmail:/bin/true
        qmailp:*:7793:2108::/var/qmail:/bin/true
        qmailq:*:7794:2107::/var/qmail:/bin/true
        qmailr:*:7795:2107::/var/qmail:/bin/true
        qmails:*:7796:2107::/var/qmail:/bin/true
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Now you can run 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make setup check
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to check your configuration, then :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
./config
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to configure qmail.</P>
<P>Attention, your server has to be resolvable by DNS or ./config will get
confused.</P>
<P>If you don't have DNS access, you can give your server name
directly via :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
./config-fast foo.bar.com
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now you must install some aliases, since /etc/alias is not used by qmail unless
you compile and install an optional package.</P>
<P>Here's my setup :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
File : ".qmail-MAILER-DAEMON"
&amp;postmaster
File : ".qmail-bin"
&amp;root
File : ".qmail-daemon"
&amp;root
File : ".qmail-decode"

|preline -dr /usr/bin/uux - -r -gC -a"${SENDER:-MAILER-DAEMON}" lm!rmail "($DEFAULT@$HOST)"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You need to create each of these file in <CODE>~alias</CODE>, replacing
<CODE>&amp;guylhem</CODE> in <CODE>.qmail-root</CODE> by your own login to get root mail.</P>
<P>ATTENTION UUCP USERS !</P>
<P>DO NOT TRUST THE QMAIL FAQ FOR UUCP, USE MY .qmail-uucp-default INSTEAD!
ELSE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND ANY MAIL BY YOUR UUCP CONNEXION!</P>
<P>Now you'll need to decide in which format your users will get their mail.</P>
<P>Here's my suggestion :
<UL>
<LI> For NFS mounted home dirs, use MAILDIR format with a patch for local
mail readers (patchs are available on www.qmail.org)</LI>
<LI> If no patch is available, prefer MAILFILE format : any mail reader can
read a file containing mail, people will only need to create an alias (for
bash) or a setenv (for csh) for their mail reader</LI>
<LI> Avoid /var/spool/mail/$USER format, too insecure</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>To fix the default format, read each file in <CODE>/var/qmail/boot</CODE>
then copy the one you best like to <CODE>/var/qmail/rc</CODE>.</P>
<P><CODE>home</CODE> or <CODE>proc</CODE> are safe choices, but prefer <CODE>home</CODE> for security
reasons.</P>

<H3>Configuring qmail </H3>


<P>In /var/qmail/control, edit:</P>

<H3>defaultdomain, me, plusdomain </H3>


<P>
<UL>
<LI> me is you local FQDN (full qualified domain name), for example on
my machine it is <CODE>barberouge.linux.lmm.com</CODE>
</LI>
<LI> defaultdomain will be added to any host name without dots, including
defaulthost, for example you can set it to <CODE>localnetwork</CODE> so any mail sent
to joe@hisbox will be completed to be sent to joe@hisbox.localnetwork instead
</LI>
<LI>plusdomain is the exception: it is added to any host name that ends
with a plus sign, including defaulthost (set in <CODE>me</CODE>) if it ends with a
plus sign.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>These 3 examples show you the power and ease of configuration of qmail!</P>

<H3>locals, rcpthosts </H3>


<P>If you want to support virtual domain names, just put additional names in these
files. Any mail you receive for these names will be handled locally.</P>
<P>The difference between <CODE>locals</CODE> and <CODE>rcpthosts</CODE> is the latter isn't
considered as a local alias, which is useful if you receive mail from some
free email address like yahoo.com or lemel.fr while you also send mail to other
users of these non local services, i.e. you don't want to handle locally mail
send to someone@yahoo.com!</P>

<H3>virtualdomains </H3>


<P>There can you specify default outgoing mode, for example :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#:alias-uucp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>if you don't want to send outgoing mail by uucp but by smtp (default) or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
:alias-ucp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>if you send your outgoing mail by uucp.</P>

<H3>Testing qmail </H3>


<P>Now it is configured, try:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &amp;'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to launch qmail (it won't interfere with your local MTA), then:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
echo to: mylogin | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You should receive this mail in the format you've chosen in
<CODE>/var/qmail/boot/</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Removing your other MTA </H3>


<P>If this test was successful, just kill your previous MTA:</P>
<P>killall -STOP daemon_name ; if any children are running, you should
killall -CONT their_name, wait, killall -STOP again, and repeat ad nauseam.</P>
<P>If there aren't any children, killall -TERM and then killall -CONT.</P>
<P>Remove it (how you can do this depends on the distribution you installed, for
example rpm -e --nodeps on RedHat, Caldera and Suse, or dpkg -r --force-depends
on Debian) then run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
# ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now set up qmail-smtpd in /etc/inetd.conf (all on one line):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
smtp stream tcp nowait qmaild /var/qmail/bin/tcp-env tcp-env /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you are using a old non-SYSV-init distribution like redhat, just add to your
boot scripts:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &amp;' 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Usually this should be /etc/rc.local but your mileage may vary.</P>
<P>For actual SYSV-init compliant distributions (RedHat, Caldera, Suse, Debian),
add this script to /etc/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/init.d/ :</P>

<P>Smail3.1 seems to be a de-facto standard transport agent for uucp-only
sites and for some smtp sites. It's easy to configure, it compiles
without patching from the sources and it's fairly secure.</P>

<H3>Configuring smail </H3>


<P>Install the smail binary from your distribution (I recommend you choose
this) or get the smail sources and build smail. If you're building smail
from sources, you need to have the following in your os/linux file so
that 'sed' gives you shell scripts that work properly.</P>

<P>Once it's installed, config. files will certainly go in /etc/smail (but your
mileage may vary if you use old distributions); let's start editing them!</P>

<P>Well, first, who is feeding you? I'm fed by "polux" via uucp (i.e.
uux transport); naturally you need to change this file according to
your own situation. For example, you could by fed by
"bargw.bar.foobar.com" via "smtp", in that case you don't need a
transport file and can define "-transport_file " to indicate you don't
need one.</P>
<P>You can also use "postmaster_address = yourname", hide the network
topology in outgoing addresses (if you're a gateway) using
"visible_name", set which aliases address can also be used for the
email you receive, using "more_hostnames".</P>
<P>See smail documentation for more details or the examples in
/usr/doc/smail/examples to see if any match your situation.</P>

# aliasinclude - expand ":include:filename" addresses produced by alias files

# aliases - search for alias expansions stored in a database
# This is the standard aliases file.  It is used for generic things,

<H3>Restarting inetd </H3>

<PRE>
         smtp stream tcp nowait  root  /usr/bin/smtpd smtpd

or:

<P>Outgoing mail gets sent automatically, when using elm.</P>

<H3>Smail with smtp </H3>


<P>Generally, ISPs use smtp, therefore you shouldn't have any problems
sending your mail. If your internet link is down when you send mail,
then the mail sits in "<CODE>/var/spool/smail/input</CODE>". When the link
next comes up, "<CODE>runq</CODE>" is run which causes the mail to be
sent. However, receiving mail is <B>the</B> problem since your
provider has many clients to look after, not only you!</P>
<P>Usually, you can retrieve your mail via the POP protocol, see POP
section below.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 OUTDATED SECTION: Sendmail+IDA</A>
</H2>


<P>For big sites, sendmail is worth choosing, due to the "incredible ease of use",
(very relative feeling when you know qmail) but you must decide which you want
between sendmail+IDA and sendmail 8.x:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> If you use an old kernel (1.0): sendmail+IDA</LI>
<LI> If you use a not so old kernel (1.2): sendmail+IDA and source code editing</LI>
<LI> Recent kernel (2.0) will choose sendmail 8.x</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Remember, linux newbies or people concerned by security / ease of
configuration should rather try using smail or qmail, which are easier
to use and safer.</P>

<H3>Source installation </H3>


<P>If your distribution doesn't provide you with a ready-to-install sendmail
package (.rpm for RedHat, Caldera and Suse, .deb for Debian) just download the
sources and run:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>cd / ; tar -zxvf sendmail5.67b+IDA1.5.tgz</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>cd to /usr/local/lib/mail/CF and copy the sample.m4 local.m4 file to
"yourhostname.m4".</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Edit out the distributed hostname, aliases, smarthost and put in the
correct one for your site. The default file is for a uucp-only site (no
longer in 8.x) who has domainized headers and who talks to a smart host.
Then "make yourhostname.cf" and move the resulting file to
/etc/sendmail.cf</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>if you are uucp-only, you do *NOT* need to create any of the tables
mentioned in the README.linux file.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You'll just have to touch the files so that the Makefile works. Just
edit the .m4 file, make sendmail.cf and start testing it.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>if you're uucp-only and you talk to sites in addition to your
"smart-host", you'll need to add uucpxtable entries for each (or mail to them
will also go through the smart host) and run dbm against the revised
uucpxtable.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you run Rich Braun's original binary distribution of 5.67a, you'll
need to freeze the configuration if you change your .cf file with
"/usr/lib/sendmail -bz" to make the changes take effect.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You should also update your version to at least 5.67b since there is a
nasty security hole in 5.67a and earlier. Another nice thing is that
if you have mail.debug set and you run syslogd, your incoming and
outgoing mail messages will get logged. See the "/etc/syslog.conf"
file for details.</P>
<P>The sources for sendmail+IDA can be found at vixen.cso.uiuc.edu ; they require
no patching to run under Linux if you're running something like a kernel of
1.00.</P>
<P>If you're running a kernel > 1.1.50, you get the fun of reversing most of the
Linux-specific patches that are now in the vanilla sources.
(I *did* told you this sendmail was only for old kernels:-)</P>
<P>It's extremely obvious where this needs to be done: just type "make"
and when it blows up, go to that line in the sources and comment out the
Linux-specific code that's in there.</P>
<P>If you're going to run sendmail+IDA, I strongly recommend you go to the
sendmail5.67b+IDA1.5 version since all required Linux-specific patches are now
in the vanilla sources and several security holes have been plugged that WERE
(!!!) in the older version you may have grabbed or built before about
December 1st, 1993.</P>
<P>Now linux kernel is 2.0, you should use sendmail 8.x instead of sendmail+IDA,
but I already told you'd better choose sendmail 8.x:-)</P>

<H3>The sendmail.m4 file </H3>


<P>Sendmail+IDA requires you to set up a <CODE>sendmail.m4</CODE> file rather than
editing the <CODE>sendmail.cf</CODE>file directly.  The nice thing about this is
that it is simple to set up mail configurations that are extremely difficult
(if not totally impossible for most people to set up correctly) in smail or
traditional sendmail.</P>
<P>The sendmail.m4 file that corresponds to the above smail example looks like
the following:</P>

<H3>Defining a local mailer</H3>

<P>Unlike most Unix distributions, Linux did not come with a local
mail delivery agent by default.</P>
<P>Slackware did!  Well at least it is offered by the
easy-to-use-but-longwinded installation script.  It uses procmail. </P>
<P>Now, deliver or procmail is generally installed, with a default sendmail
setup to handle local mail, so no complexity will be added to this
already very complex setup. I recommend using the commonly available
<CODE>deliver</CODE> or <CODE>procmail</CODE> programs, which can be optional
packages in a some Linux distributions.</P>
<P>In order to do so, you need to define a <CODE>LOCAL_MAILER_DEF</CODE> in the
<CODE>sendmail.m4</CODE> file that points to a file that looks like:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  # -- /usr/local/lib/mail/mailers.linux --
  #     (local mailers for use on Linux )
  Mlocal, P=/usr/bin/deliver, F=SlsmFDMP, S=10, R=25/10, A=deliver $u
  Mprog,  P=/bin/sh,       F=lsDFMeuP,   S=10, R=10, A=sh -c $u
</PRE>
</P>
<P>There is a also built-in default for <CODE>deliver</CODE> in the
<CODE>Sendmail.mc</CODE> file that gets included into the
<CODE>sendmail.cf</CODE> file. To specify it, you would not use the
<CODE>mailers.linux</CODE> file but would instead define the following in
your sendmail.m4 file:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   dnl --- (in sendmail.m4) ---
   define(LOCAL_MAILER_DEF, DELIVER)dnl       # mailer for local delivery
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Sendmail.mc assumes deliver is installed in /bin, which
is not the case with Slackware1.1.1 (which installs it in /usr/bin).
In that case you'd need to either fake it with a link or rebuild
deliver from sources so that it resides in /bin. Please note procmail
is generally better than deliver, for example for mail filtering.</P>

<H3>The sendmail+IDA dbm tables </H3>


<P>Setting up special behavior for sites or domains is done through a number of
optional <CODE>dbm</CODE> tables rather than editing the <CODE>sendmail.cf</CODE> file
directly.</P>
<P>Refer to the July-1994 issue of <CODE>Linux Journal</CODE> (if you can still find
it:-), to the docs in the sources, or to the sendmail chapter in the newest
version of the Linux Documentation Project <CODE>Networking Administration Guide</CODE> which
will be available real-soon-now for more details.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>mailertable   - defines special behavior for remote hosts or domains.</LI>
<LI>uucpxtable    - forces UUCP delivery of mail to hosts that are in DNS format.</LI>
<LI>pathtable     - defines UUCP bang-paths to remote hosts or domains.</LI>
<LI>uucprelays    - short-circuits the pathalias path to well-known remote hosts.</LI>
<LI>genericfrom   - converts internal addresses into generic ones visible to the outside world.</LI>
<LI>xaliases      - converts generic addresses to/from valid internal ones.</LI>
<LI>decnetxtable  - converts RFC-822 addresses to DECnet-style addresses.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>So which entries are really required?</H3>

<P> When not using any of the optional dbm tables, sendmail delivers
mail via the <CODE>RELAY_HOST</CODE> and <CODE>RELAY_MAILER)</CODE>
defined in the sendmail.m4 file used to generate sendmail.cf. It
is easily possible to override this behavior through entries in
the domaintable or uucpxtable.</P>
<P>A generic site that is on Internet and speaks Domain Name Service, or one that
is UUCP-only and forwards all mail via UUCP through a smart
<CODE>RELAY_HOST</CODE>, probably does not need any specific table entries at all.</P>
<P>Virtually all systems should set the <CODE>DEFAULT_HOST</CODE> and
<CODE>PSEUDONYMS</CODE> macros, which define the canonical site name and aliases
it is known by.</P>
<P>If all you have is a relay host and relay mailer, you don't need to
set these defaults since it works automagically. UUCP hosts will
probably also need to set <CODE>UUCPNAME</CODE> to their official UUCP
name.</P>
<P>They will also probably set <CODE>RELAY_MAILER</CODE> and <CODE>RELAY_HOST</CODE>
which enable smart-host routing through a mail relay.</P>
<P>The mail transport to be used is defined in <CODE>RELAY_MAILER</CODE> and
should usually be UUCP-A for UUCP sites. If your site is SMTP-only and
talks `Domain Name Service', you would change the
<CODE>RELAY_MAILER</CODE>.</P>
<P>If you're a SLIP site, you might want to take the easy way out and just
forward all outgoing mail to your service provider to do the right thing with.
To do so, you'd want to define ISOLATED_DOMAINS and VALIDATION_DOMAINS to be
your domain, you'd also want to define RELAY_HOST to be your service provider
and RELAY_MAILER to be TCP. Of course, you want to ask permission before you
set any system up as your general purpose relay.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Sendmail 8.x</A>
</H2>


<P>Sendmail 8.7.x from Berkeley was the latest major revision after
sendmail5. It had wonderful built-in support for building under Linux
: just "make linux" and all was set.</P>
<P>You'll probably be best served by grabbing one of the various binary
distributions off of the usual Linux archive sites rather than fighting things
like Berkeley dbm yourself.</P>
<P>There's a nice distribution of sendmail 8.6.12 from Jason Haar - <CODE>j.haar at lazerjem.demon.co.uk </CODE> on sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/system/Mail/delivery/sendmail-8.6.12-bin.tgz that has the source
documentation and a very nice quickie description of how to run sendmail v8 for
common configurations.</P>
<P>The bottom line with sendmail v8 is that you want to configure the

<H3>A sample 8.7.x mc file </H3>


<P>Much like sendmail+IDA, sendmail v8 uses m4 to process a config file into
a full sendmail.cf that sendmail uses.  The following is my current mc file
for my site (ppp to Internet for outgoing mail, uucp for incoming mail).</P>

        #       - connected via UUCP for incoming mail
        #       - domainized headers

        #       - all non-local outbound mail goes to the RELAY_HOST over smtp
        #           (we run ppp and let our service provider do the work)

<H3>Sendmail v8 tidbits </H3>


<P>There are a few differences I suppose to the 'IDA bigots' among us.
So far, I've found the following:</P>

<P> Instead of 'runq', you type 'sendmail -q' to run the queue! </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Local Delivery Agents </A>
</H2>


<P>Unlike most operating systems, Linux did not have mail "built-in": you needed
a program to deliver the local mail, like "lmail", "procmail" or "deliver".</P>
<P>However, every recent distribution includes a local mailer now!</P>
<P>Documentation for how to use either for local delivery is in the
sendmail5.67b+IDA1.5 binary release (on sunsite) mentioned above.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. User Agent Administration </A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Mutt </A>
</H2>


<P>You should have no problem compiling, installing, or running mutt.
Users of qmail can either get the patch or run it with -f flag to read
their local mail folder.</P>
<P>If mutt bothers you with an "unknown terminal error" after a distribution
upgrading, just recompile it.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Elm </A>
</H2>


<P>Elm compiles, installs and runs flawlessly under Linux. For more
information, see the elm sources and installation instructions. Elm
and filter need to be mode 2755 (group mail) with /var/spool/mail mode
775 and group mail.</P>
<P>Qmail users can get a patch to use nifty qmail features, or will run elm with
the -f flag to point to their local mail folder.</P>
<P>One thing you want to be aware of is that if you have Elm compiled to
be MIME-able, you need metamail installed and in the standard path or
Elm will not be able to read MIME mail you've received.  Metamail is
available on <CODE>thumper.bellcore.com</CODE> and of course via "archie".</P>
<P>If you use a binary distribution, you'll need to create a
"/usr/local/lib/elm/elm.rc" file to override the compiled-in hostname and
domain information:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>replace "subdomain.domain" with your domain name replace
</LI>
<LI>"myhostname" with you un-domainized hostname replace
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        #---------- /usr/local/lib/elm/elm.rc ------------------
        #
        # this is the unqualified hostname
        hostname = myhostname
        #
        # this is the local domain
        hostdomain = subdomain.domain
        #
        # this is the fully qualified hostname
        hostfullname = myhostname.subdomain.domain
        #
        #--------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
</P>
<P>One thing you want to be aware of is that if you have Elm compiled to
be MIME enabled, you need metamail installed and in your path or Elm
will not be able to read MIME mail you've received. Metamail is
available on <CODE>thumper.bellcore.com</CODE> and of course via "archie".</P>
<P>In the "too cool to be true" category, there is a distribution of
Elm-2.4.24 that is "PGP-aware". To try it, grab the file
<CODE>ftp://ftp.viewlogic.com/pub/elm-2.4pl24pgp3.tar.gz</CODE>, which is
elm2.4.24 with PGP hooks added. You configure and build it the same
way you do normal Elm, which means you probably need to add the
patches mentioned above. For what it's worth, I run it here and like
it a lot. Of course, there must be more recent versions available,
including elm-ME+.</P>
<P>While this item is not Linux-specific, it's perceived (wrongly) to be
a nagging Elm bug nevertheless.  We've heard that Elm sometimes fails with a
message that it's unable to malloc() some massive number of bytes.
The identified workaround is to remove the post-processed global mail aliases
(aliases.dir and aliases.pag).</P>
<P><CODE>THIS IS NOT A BUG IN ELM</CODE>, it's an error in configuration of Elm by
whomever you got your binary distribution of Elm from.</P>
<P>Elm has an enhanced and non-compatible, format for aliases ; you need
to ensure that the path Elm uses for aliases is different from the
path sendmail/smail uses. From the volume of reports of this problem,
it's apparent that at least one major distribution 'on the street' has
in the past been misconfigured. (from <CODE> scot at catzen.gun.de (Scot
W. Stevenson) </CODE>)</P>
<P>The current metamail package requires csh for some of its scripts.
Failure to have csh (or tcsh) will cause most interesting errors...</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Mailx </A>
</H2>


<P>If you don't have a local <CODE>mailx</CODE> program, save yourself the pain -- just go
and grab the mailx kit from Slackware 2.1.0 or later, which has a nice
implementation of mailx5.5. If you're into building from sources, mailx v5.5
compiles without patching under Linux if you have <CODE>"pmake"</CODE> installed.</P>
<P>If anybody is still using it, I strongly recommend removing the old "edmail"
stuff from SLS1.00 and replacing it with mailx.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Handling remote mail</A></H2>


<P>This section describes using POP or IMAP to handle remote mail.</P>
<P>Other options include nfs-mounting the spool partition on client
machines (Danger Will Robinson! Is everyone using the same lock
method?) or using a mail-to-web gateway (quite popular now).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 History </A>
</H2>


<P>On a workstation network, mail has always been a problem:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Either you use "user@computer.foo.com" with problems when "computer" is
down, making your network known to the people outside, having different
addresses for a same person switching to another computer, ... 
</LI>
<LI>Or you take a mail hub, "mailhost.foo.com" with rules for rewriting,
so every user seems to post from the same address, even if they are on
different computers.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>But in that case, how can users read their mail?</P>
<P>Using a rsh with elm? :-)</P>
<P>It would overload our mail hub!
One method was forwarding or UUCP, smtp, etc. but it's too complicated.</P>
<P>Then came POP/IMAP, both with security problems at the beginning, (now
fixed using ssh on new versions): a mail program has sometimes to be set
locally (like qmail, smail or vmail if, for example, you use elm, but
mozilla will avoid that!) however, getting and sending Email is simpler.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Getting mail </A>
</H2>


<P>Here come POP's main drawbacks:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the password is sent as a clear text on the network,</LI>
<LI>you must choose a POP-aware mailer; many do now (like Pine,
Emacs, Mozilla, Netscape, Mutt, IE, Pegasus, Eudora, Claris...),</LI>
<LI>when a user may roam (read mail from different machines) having
e-mail popped on the computer used yesterday can be a nuisance,</LI>
<LI>some POP servers (e.g. qpopper, ipop3d) on high-use servers can
load the machine significantly. Consider controlling options (such as
not leaving mail on the server) and/or changing the pop server
(e.g. cucipop), as well as avoiding running it from inetd.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The password problem can be solved creating a crypted "channel" to have
POP on it or using APOP or RPOP extensions. The mail reader problem can
be solved either by changing mail reader (don't underestimate the effort
required to re-educate users!) or by using a POP "mail sucker" with a
local mail program.</P>
<P>IMAP can be preferable to POP in various situations like remote (and
especially roaming) access, while you restrict POP to a LAN where
snooping of passwords isn't so much of a concern.  Mark Aitchison
reported a solution here is to use hosts.deny and hosts.allow files
(please see Net-3 HOWTO ; this assumes you are starting pop from
inet).</P>
<P>The policy of leaving mail on the server or not has implications for
server disk space and easier backup/security of the mail, as well as
allowing roaming, so the best solution depends on the type of
organization. Of course, this will not ensure your mail can't be read,
but nobody will be able to delete it ; if all your mail is pgp
encrypted this is a better solution.</P>
<P>Here are some pop programs worth trying:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> gwpop (a Good Way to POP) is very protected since it creates a crypted
"channel" and puts mail directly in the "spool" ; however, it depends on Perl.</LI>
<LI> popclient, simple to use:

For example if your login is john and your password
PrettySecret, you will run:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ popclient -3 -v mail.acme.net -u john -p "PrettySecret" -k -o JOHN-INET-MAIL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


It is strongly discouraged in case of multi-user machine;
other user can see your password by, for example with "ps auxw"
</LI>
<LI> fetchmail, which is actively supported and incredibly simple to use:
it is configured in <CODE>~/.fetchmailrc</CODE>, so you only need to run
<CODE>fetchmail</CODE> when you want to retrive your mail.

Here's my .fetchmailrc:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
poll mail.server protocol pop3:
        forcecr
        password PrettySecret;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Don't forget to "chmod 600 &nbsp;/.fetchmailrc" or fetchmail will ask for it.

Please note that the forcecr option is needed to use fetchmail with
qmail, which strictly respects RFCs.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Sending mail </A>
</H2>


<P>For this, you must use smtp-aware mail software, like qmail, smail, vmail
or mozilla (this one does everything: mail reader, POP receive, smtp send!)</P>
<P>Go to one of the previous sections to install and configure the one
you like best. Then, when you will reach "Testing", try to send some
mail to a local account on the mail hub.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Reading mail </A>
</H2>


<P>If your program doesn't do everything itself, you can install elm, pgp, mush,
pine ... many good programs are freely available for linux platforms!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Testing </A>
</H2>


<P>To check whether your mail server has pop, try:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ telnet mailhost 110
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If it works, you will get something like "OK Pop server (...) starting": type
"quit"!</P>
<P>To install a ssh crypted "channel", first test your mail server typing:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ssh mailhost date
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you get the date, you should be OK. Please note ssh will not ask
for a password, therefore you must create a ".shosts" file on the mail
server, containing client's name. To test ssh port redirection (which
gwpop uses), type:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ssh -n -f -L 12314:localhost:110 mailhost sleep 30

then

$ telnet localhost 12314
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Then will you hopefully see mail hub's pop banner. If you don't use
ssh, don't forget to comment out $ssh on gwpop script. To check
whether procmail is running, try "procmail -v"</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Using </A>
</H2>


<P>Now you can edit gwpop Perl script to check everything is ok, then run gwpop:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gwpop -v your-username
POP password on mailhost: yoursecretpasword
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If gwpop "error messages" are normal, the mail from mail hub will be downloaded
to your local machine wherever you told gwpop to put it.
(please test with some mail!).</P>
<P>You can also use gwpop as a daemon:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gwpop -d $HOME/tmp your-username
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>gwpop messages are then sent to syslog and gwpop will run endlessly ; a "HUP"
signal will force gwpop to get your mail.</P>
<P>You can get POP software here used on:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.unina.it/pub/Unix/pkgs/network/mail/gwpop
ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail
http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/
