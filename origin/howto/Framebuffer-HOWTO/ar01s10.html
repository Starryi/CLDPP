			a lovely British processor), there are two versions of
			the Cyber2000 framebuffer driver - one for 2.0.x
			kernels and one for 2.2.x kernels. It is quite
			straightforward to enable and use this driver on both
			kernels, however, the older version is hardcoded for
			depth and resolution (blech), but the good news is that
			the newer version in the 2.2.x kernels is much more
			flexible, but currently in a state of flux as it is
			still in development. To get this up and running, your
			best bet is to read the documentation that comes with
			the ARM port of the kernel sources.</p><p>The Netwinders uses a VGA compatible chipset, but
			unfortunately noone has ported vgafb to it yet. That
			might happen if someone has some time on their
			hands. [I would do it if someone would give me a
			NetWinder to play with]</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1004"></a>10.2. Acorn Archimedes</h3></div></div></div><p>Acorns have always had framebuffer support since
				the Linux 1.9.x days. However the Acornfb
				driver in 2.2.x is totally new since the
				generic framebuffer interface changed during
				the development of 2.1.x kernels (which, of
				course, became 2.2.x). As previously, it is a
				simple matter to activate the driver and
				set depths and resolutions.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1007"></a>10.3. Other ARM ports (SA7710s et. al.)</h3></div></div></div><p>Surprisingly, there is even a framebuffer driver
				for the Psion 5 and the Geofox!  I have been
				told that it displays the Penguin quite well.
