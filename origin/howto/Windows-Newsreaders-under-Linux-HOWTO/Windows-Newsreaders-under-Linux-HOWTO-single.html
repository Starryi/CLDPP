One of the problems with Linux today is the lack of variety and choice in 
newsreader software, where Windows has several newsreader programs with better
features and better stability. Under Windows, three of the most popular 
newsreaders are Xnews, Dialog, and Free Agent.
</p><p>
Xnews, created by Luu Tran, is a freeware newsreader for Windows,
available from the website
<a class="ulink" href="http://xnews.newsguy.com/" target="_top">http://xnews.newsguy.com</a>. Here 
is a list of Xnews' features listed on the website:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
     100% GNKSA 2.0 (Good Net Keeping Seal of Approval) compliant.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Plonk file (aka bozo bin).
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Quick filter (type in a regex and only articles whose
     subject/author match it will be shown).
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Score file for advanced filtering.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Support for multiple servers/identities.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Subscribed groups can be organized into categories.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Remappable keyboard.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Binaries handling (mime, base64, uuencode, what have you).
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Optional header and article caching; plus: folders for permanent
     archival.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     more...
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
Unfortunately, Luu Tran has decided neither to make his newsreader
open-source nor to release a Linux version. However, there is a way to get
Xnews to work under Linux, although it takes a bit of work.
</p><p>
Dialog is a newsreader by 40tude. It is available at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.40tude.com/dialog/" target="_top">http://www.40tude.com/dialog/</a>.
According to the website, "it supports multiple servers and identities, has
filtering/scoring support, integrated email functionality and binary support
including support for multiparts." The newsreader is "shareware for
commercial users and freeware for private users." It works excellently
under Linux. 
</p><p>
Free Agent is the feature-slimmed freeware version of Forte's commercial 
e-mail and Usenet client Agent. It is available at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.forteinc.com/agent" target="_top">http://www.forteinc.com/agent/</a>.
According to the Features section of the website, the program has basic
newsreader functions, message threading, multi-part binaries, translations,
internal multi-tasking, and URL detection. It also has partial support for
offline data storage, group properties, UI configuration, searching, and
sorting. It runs with few problems under Linux after almost no extra 
configuration, except under Wine versions later than 20030813. 
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="prereqs"></a>1.1. Prerequisites</h3></div></div></div><p>
This HOWTO assumes that:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
The InfoZIP utilities are installed on the Linux machine. These are available
at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/" target="_top">InfoZIP's web site.</a>
The unzip program is required if the reader wants to install Xnews or Dialog 
without copying from an existing installation. This is a standard part 
of most Linux distributions, but may not be automatically installed.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The Wine "emulator" is installed properly on the Linux machine. To
download Wine, visit 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.winehq.com/" target="_top">http://www.winehq.com</a>. 
The version used at the
time of this writing was 20031212.
UPDATE (version 2.01): Wine versions later than 20030813 will not work. 
UPDATE (version 2.2): Wine version 20031212 may be required under more modern 
Linux setups. There are more problems with this version, and Dialog will not
work, but older Wine versions will not "emulate" properly without it 
and will cause a crash upon trying to access NNTP servers. Try 20030813 first,
and then try version 20031212 if you have problems.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The reader of this document has access to a Windows machine. Certain files are 
needed from the Windows operating system. Access to Windows 98SE is preferred. 
This HOWTO covers Windows 98SE and Windows XP. Windows ME files will also work
when running Xnews if a Windows 98SE configuration is used.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Xnews stable version 5.04.25 is used (the beta version was not
tested at the time of this writing). The website for Xnews is

Wine is capable of "emulating" many different versions of Windows. 
Wine is not perfect, however; it runs slower than a normal Windows installation
and it is not a stable product. Certain problems occur when running Xnews; 
these are discussed in the 
"<a class="link" href="#x-problems" title="2.3. Problems and Issues">Problems and Issues</a>" section of 
the document.
</p><p>
Before Xnews can run under Linux, certain files from a Windows installation 
need to be copied to the Xnews root directory. Depending on which version of 
Windows you have access to, there will be different files to copy and different
instructions for configuring Wine. This document currently covers a Windows 
98SE/Windows ME and a Windows XP configuration. A Windows 98SE/Windows ME 
configuration is preferred, since there are some more problems with a Windows 
XP configuration. Below are the instructions describing how to configure Wine 
for Xnews.
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm157"></a>2.1.1.1. Windows 98SE / Windows ME</h5></div></div></div><p>
If you have access to a Windows 98SE or Windows ME machine, you must set up 
the Wine configuration file (found at <code class="filename">$HOME/.wine/config</code>) 
according to these instructions.
</p><p>
First, find the section "<code class="literal">[Version]</code>" in the 
<code class="filename">.wine/config</code> file, and make sure that
"<code class="literal">win98</code>" is the version Wine will imitate:
</p><pre class="screen">
     [Version]
     ; Windows version to imitate (win95,win98,winme,nt351,nt40,win2k,winxp,win20,win30,win31)
     "Windows" = "win98"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Second, update the "<code class="literal">DllOverrides</code>" section
which will tell Wine to use certain files from Windows rather than Wine.
</p><pre class="screen">
     [DllOverrides]
     ; some dlls you may want to change
     "shell"        = "native, builtin"
     "shell32"      = "native, builtin"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Third, add an entry to the "<code class="literal">AppDefaults</code>" 
section which will also tell Wine to use certain files from Windows rather 
than Wine.
</p><pre class="screen">
    ;; sample AppDefaults entries

    [AppDefaults\\Xnews.exe\\DllOverrides]
    "commctrl.dll" = "native"
    "comctl32.dll" = "native"
    "riched32.dll" = "native"
    "shell.dll" = "native"
    "shell32.dll" = "native"
    "comdlg32.dll" = "native"
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm172"></a>2.1.1.2. Windows XP</h5></div></div></div><p>
If you have access to a Windows XP machine, you must set up the Wine 
configuration file (found at <code class="filename">$HOME/.wine/config</code>) according
to these instructions.
</p><p>
First, find the section "<code class="literal">[Version]</code>" in the 
<code class="filename">.wine/config</code> file, and make sure that
"<code class="literal">win98</code>" is the version Wine will imitate:
</p><pre class="screen">
     [Version]
     ; Windows version to imitate (win95,win98,winme,nt351,nt40,win2k,winxp,win20,win30,win31)
     "Windows" = "win98"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Second, add an entry to the "<code class="literal">AppDefaults</code>" 
section which will tell Wine to use certain files from Windows rather 
than Wine.
</p><pre class="screen">
    ;; sample AppDefaults entries

    [AppDefaults\\Xnews.exe\\DllOverrides]
    "comctl32.dll" = "native"
    "riched32.dll" = "native"
    "riched20.dll" = "native"
</pre><p>
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm184"></a>2.1.2. Copying and/or Extracting Required Files</h4></div></div></div><p>
Several DLL files must first be copied to the root Xnews directory from
an existing Windows installation.
</p><p>
If Xnews lies on a Windows partition on the same machine, you must copy the DLL
files to the Xnews root directory. Xnews will be run from this directory 
on the Windows partition.
</p><p>
If Xnews is being run on a Linux-only machine, you must download Xnews to
your fake C drive (usually <code class="filename">$HOME/c</code>) and extract it
into a directory there. Open up a terminal window, navigate to your fake C
drive, and type the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
     mkdir Xnews
     mv xnews.zip Xnews
     cd Xnews
     unzip xnews.zip
</pre><p>
Alternatively, you may copy an existing Xnews folder to your fake C drive. The
root Xnews directory must include the DLL files mentioned in the following 
subsections.
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm191"></a>2.1.2.1. Windows 98SE</h5></div></div></div><p>
If you have access to a Windows 98SE machine, copy the files 
<code class="filename">commctrl.dll</code>, <code class="filename">comctl32.dll</code>,
<code class="filename">riched32.dll</code>, <code class="filename">comdlg32.dll</code>,
<code class="filename">shell.dll</code>, and <code class="filename">shell32.dll</code> 
(usually in <code class="filename">C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM</code>) to the root Xnews directory.
</p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm201"></a>2.1.2.2. Windows XP</h5></div></div></div><p>
If you have access to a Windows XP machine, copy the files 
<code class="filename">comctl32.dll</code>, <code class="filename">riched20.dll</code>,
and <code class="filename">riched32.dll</code> (usually in 
<code class="filename">C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32</code>) to the root Xnews directory.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="run_xnews"></a>2.2. Running Xnews</h3></div></div></div><p>
Using a terminal window, navigate to the root Xnews directory and type:
</p><pre class="screen">
     wine Xnews.exe
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Use Xnews normally, noting the exceptions in the next section, entitled
"<a class="link" href="#x-problems" title="2.3. Problems and Issues">Problems and Issues</a>" 
Note that these are problems with Wine's "emulation," not
Xnews.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="x-problems"></a>2.3. Problems and Issues</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm216"></a>2.3.1. Fixed-width fonts and alt.ascii-art</h4></div></div></div><p>
ASCII art requires fixed-width fonts to view. Clicking the fixed font button 
above the message headers will simply lock the message so that the vertical 
scrollbar will not work.
</p><p>
The easiest way to deal with this is to go into
"Special -&gt; Setup Xnews -&gt; Fonts and Colors"
and select a fixed font for all types
of text. The default "Fixed" will not work; 
use "Misc Fixed", size 12.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm220"></a>2.3.2. Erasing sections of text</h4></div></div></div><p>
Selecting sections of text with the mouse and pressing Backspace or Delete
will delete the text from the screen, but for some reason it might still look 
like it's there when the message is sent or posted.
</p><p>
To solve this problem, press the "Rewrap" button below the message headers.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm224"></a>2.3.3. Window sizing problems</h4></div></div></div><p>
There are several problems relating to the sizing of the windows. When the
CatchUp button is clicked, the main groups list window shrinks and must be
maximized. These are mostly minor annoyances, except...
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm227"></a>2.3.3.1. Closing Xnews</h5></div></div></div><p>
Depending on the window manager (Sawfish has problems with this), it may be 
impossible to close the Xnews window, and there is no "Exit" option 
in the main menu. To get around this, make sure that the window is sized so 
that the terminal used to launch Xnews is accessible, and close that
terminal.  Do not press 
<span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>C</strong></span>, 
etc as this will cause problems. Be
sure to click the Save button to save the newsrc first.

</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm233"></a>2.3.4. Binary newsgroups</h4></div></div></div><p>
The posting of binaries to newsgroups does not currently work. An attempted
post will lock at 1% completion and give an error message when the post is
aborted, posting only the text portion of the message. However, the combining
and decoding of binaries works with no problems at all.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm236"></a>2.3.5. Text on some tabs are indented</h4></div></div></div><p>
If Windows XP is "emulated," certain tabs will have text indented,
leaving some of it out of visibility. The solution is to use Windows 98SE files
instead of XP files. It isn't that important. UPDATED: Version 2.0 of this
document includes new instructions which solve this problem when Windows XP
files are used.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm239"></a>2.3.6. No sample text in font selection dialog</h4></div></div></div><p>
If Windows XP is "emulated," the font selection dialog will not show
sample text. According to a
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.winehq.com/hypermail/wine-devel/2003/07/0476.html" target="_top">Wine
mailing list message</a>, there are certain un-"emulated" 
functions in Windows XP "emulation." Version 1.1 of this document was
updated with new files to copy and configure when using Windows 98SE 
"emulation" in order to solve this problem. Until the Wine developers
implement these Windows XP functions, use a Windows 98SE configuration to get 
around this issue. If a Windows 98SE computer is not available, just apply 
changes and look at the main window.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm243"></a>2.3.7. Web links can not be executed</h4></div></div></div><p>
Web links can not be executed from within the Xnews message window. This is
pretty obvious as there is no integrated Web browser in Wine. However, Wine's
clipboard works with no problem. Select the link and copy and paste into an open
web browser window.
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm246"></a>2.3.7.1. Web link doesn't always copy</h5></div></div></div><p>
When you try and copy a Web link to the clipboard, it may not copy. This
occurs when the link as a whole is copied rather than selected text. The
solution to this is to make sure that as you are selecting the text, the rest
of the link is not automatically selected. If this continues, select the blank
space before the link and copy with the preceding blank space.
</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm249"></a>2.3.8. Sound does not work</h4></div></div></div><p>
Event sounds in Xnews do not currently work. Updated instructions for this may 
be included in future versions of this document. 
</p><p>
UPDATED (version 2.11): Event sounds work properly. If you run KDE, you first 
need to turn off the aRts soundserver by going into Settings -&gt; Control 
Center -&gt; Sounds &amp; Multimedia -&gt; Sound System and unchecking 
"Start aRts soundserver on KDE Startup" (instructions were tested on 
version 3.1.3; may be different for other versions). Note that this will 
disable event sounds for KDE applications which depend on the aRts soundserver.
Xnews sounds work properly under the Gnome sound server.

In some cases, the message body of a Compose window does not automatically
wrap. Simply clicking "Rewrap Text" as this happens will fix the
problem.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm256"></a>2.3.10. XFaces are not visible</h4></div></div></div><p>
When a Wine version greater than 20030813 is being used, the XFace is not
visible when a message is being composed or read, and the box where the XFace 
would be is colored black. Ignore this, since the correct XFace is being posted
anyway. Try to use Wine version 20030813 if you can.

Wine is capable of "emulating" many different versions of Windows.
Wine is not perfect, however; it runs slower than a normal Windows installation
and it is not a stable product. Certain problems occur when running Dialog;
these are discussed in the
"<a class="link" href="#d-problems" title="3.3. Problems and Issues">Problems and Issues</a>" section of 
the document. Note that Wine versions greater than 20030813 will not
"emulate" Dialog properly. 
</p><p>
Before Dialog or its installer can run under Linux, certain files from a 
Windows installation need to be copied to the directory containing Dialog's
installer, and after installation, Dialog's root directory. Depending 
on which version of Windows the reader of this document has access to, there 
will be different files to copy and different instructions for configuring 
Wine. This document currently covers a Windows 98SE and a Windows XP 
configuration. Below are the instructions describing how to configure Wine for 
Dialog.
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm268"></a>3.1.1.1. Windows 98SE</h5></div></div></div><p>
If you have access to a Windows 98SE machine, the Wine configuration file 
(found at <code class="filename">$HOME/.wine/config</code>) must be set up
according to these instructions.
</p><p>
First, find the section "<code class="literal">[Version]</code>" in the
<code class="filename">.wine/config</code> file, and make sure that
"<code class="literal">win98</code>" is the version Wine will imitate:
</p><pre class="screen">
     [Version]
     ; Windows version to imitate (win95,win98,winme,nt351,nt40,win2k,winxp,win20,win30,win31)
     "Windows" = "win98"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Next, add an entry to the "<code class="literal">AppDefaults</code>"
section which will also tell Wine to use certain files from Windows rather
than Wine.
</p><pre class="screen">
    ;; sample AppDefaults entries

    [AppDefaults\\dialog.exe\\DllOverrides]
    "commctrl.dll" = "native"
    "comctl32.dll" = "native"
    "riched32.dll" = "native"
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm280"></a>3.1.1.2. Windows XP</h5></div></div></div><p>
If you have access to a Windows XP machine, you must set up the Wine
configuration file (found at <code class="filename">$HOME/.wine/config</code>) according
to these instructions.
</p><p>
First, find the section "<code class="literal">[Version]</code>" in the
<code class="filename">.wine/config</code> file, and make sure that
"<code class="literal">win98</code>" is the version Wine will imitate:
</p><pre class="screen">
     [Version]
     ; Windows version to imitate (win95,win98,winme,nt351,nt40,win2k,winxp,win20,win30,win31)
     "Windows" = "win98"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Second, add an entry to the "<code class="literal">AppDefaults</code>"
section which will tell Wine to use certain files from Windows rather
than Wine.
</p><pre class="screen">
    ;; sample AppDefaults entries

    [AppDefaults\\dialog.exe\\DllOverrides]
    "comctl32.dll" = "native"
    "riched32.dll" = "native"
    "riched20.dll" = "native"
</pre><p>

Several DLL files must first be copied to the root Dialog directory from
an existing Windows installation.
</p><p>
If Dialog lies on a Windows partition on the same machine, you must copy the DLL
files to the Dialog root directory. Dialog will be run from this directory
on the Windows partition.
</p><p>
If Dialog is being run on a Linux-only machine, you must download Dialog to
your fake C drive (usually <code class="filename">$HOME/c</code>). You must then use 
the supplied installer according to the instructions in the subsection below 
entitled "<a class="link" href="#d-installer" title="3.1.2.1. Using the Installer">Using the Installer</a>."
Alternatively, you may copy an existing Dialog folder to your fake
C drive. The root Dialog directory must include the DLL files mentioned in the 
following subsections.
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d-installer"></a>3.1.2.1. Using the Installer</h5></div></div></div><p>
To extract the archive which contains the Dialog installer, open up a terminal
window, navigate to your fake C drive (where Dialog was downloaded to) and type:
</p><pre class="screen">
     unzip 40td2b28.zip
</pre><p>
The name of the file may be different depending on the version of Dialog 
downloaded.
</p><p>
In order for the installer to work correctly, certain DLL files from Windows
need to be copied to the directory where the installer is located. If you
have access to a Windows 98SE machine, copy the file 
<code class="filename">riched32.dll</code> to your fake C drive. If you have access to
a Windows XP machine, copy the files <code class="filename">riched20.dll</code> and
<code class="filename">riched32.dll</code> to your fake C drive. 
</p><p>
Finally, to install Dialog, open up a terminal window, navigate to your fake
C drive, and type:
</p><pre class="screen">
     wine SETUP.EXE
</pre><p>
Installation of Dialog should work fine from here. Be sure to copy the DLL
files mentioned in the rest of this section to your Dialog root directory
before running the program.

<code class="filename">commctrl.dll</code>, <code class="filename">comctl32.dll</code>,
and <code class="filename">riched32.dll</code> (usually in

</pre><p>
</p><p>
Use Dialog normally, noting the exceptions in the next section, entitled
"<a class="link" href="#d-problems" title="3.3. Problems and Issues">Problems and Issues</a>"
Note that these are problems with Wine's "emulation," not
Dialog.
