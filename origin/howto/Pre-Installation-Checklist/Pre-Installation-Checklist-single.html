>        	Are you a Linux newbie ? Are you a Linux guru ? In both cases, you will find
                this checklist of great help to you. How many times have you found yourself
                fumbling in the middle of a Linux installation process, because some vital
                information about the target hardware is not known ?
               	</P
><P
>        	Have you ever crossed your fingers when you were asked by the installation
                procedure, a simple question, like: to which COM port is the mouse
                connected ?
        	</P
><P
>                Let's face it, all of us have, at one time or another, felt we should have
                been better prepared before starting to install Linux. Here is a simple
                solution, brought to you by Algologic Research &#38; Solutions

        during the course of installation of Linux on your machine or on anybody
        else's machine. Sometimes, it is very inconvenient and even impossible
        to find out some details in the middle of an installation procedure. This
        becomes all the more difficult when you are installing Linux on somebody
        else's machine, and in somebody else's office.

        Linux on your PC will begin by answering a few simple
        questions about your hardware.
        </P
><P
>        This checklist will make it easy for you and us to go through
        the  installation, painlessly and without  surprises.  Please
        take  your  own  time and fill up  the  following  checklist.
        Wherever   possible,  and  necessary,  we  have  given   some
        suggestions and hints, for your convenience.
        </P
><P
>        If you don't know all the details, you should be able to find
        them  in  your  computer's manuals.  Or,  ask  your  hardware
        vendor, or your local hardware "guru."
        </P

>        If  you still have problems finding answers, don't  worry  --
        you   can  just  ignore any areas you don't know.  Bring   in
        your   machine  and  ALL manuals you have.  The  installation
        may succeed with some trials and  a lot of luck.
        </P
><P
>        Remember,  Linux,  like many other software  products,  is  a
        growing  product.  Some  of your hardware may  still  not  be
