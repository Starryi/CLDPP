1. Introduction


1.1. Purpose of this document

This document lists what I consider to be the essential book-length references
for learning Unix (especially Linux) and how to program under it.

1.2. New versions of this document

New versions of the Linux Reading List HOWTO will be periodically posted to
comp.os.linux.answers. They will also be uploaded to various Linux WWW and FTP
sites, including the LDP home page.
You can also view the latest version of this on the World Wide Web via the URL
http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html.

1.3. Feedback and Corrections

If you have questions or comments about this document (or just want to suggest
a book that you think should be on it), please feel free to mail Eric S.
Raymond, at <esr@thyrsus.com>. I welcome any suggestions or criticisms.

1.4.  Related Resources

For on-line HOWTOs, magazines, and other non-book material, see the Linux
Documentation_Project_home_page.
Some years ago I wrote a less Linux-focused Unix bibliography that may still be
of some interest and retains a certain amusement value. You can find the
Loginataka here.
SAGE, the System Administrator's Guild, maintains an excellent list_of_relevant
books.

1.5.  Conventions Used In This Document

Comments not in quotes below are either mine, or I have seen no reason to
change them from those of Jim Haynes (previous maintainer of this document).
Comments sent in by others are in quotes, and have the name of the commentator
before them (JH is Jim Haynes).
"See" URLs attached to publishing information point directly into the
publisher's web catalog and typically take you to a page containing a cover
shot, blurbs, and ordering information. Books that don't have these lack them
because the publisher is using frames and the catalog pages can't be
bookmarked.
Topic listings go roughly from the outside in (culture to user-land programming
to kernel programming to hardware). Within sections I have tried to list the
most useful books first insofar as I am familiar with them. It's just an
embarrassing coincidence that this lists one of my books first, honest!
(Suggestions for a better organization cheerfully accepted.)

This document is copyright 1999 by Eric S. Raymond. You may use, disseminate,
and reproduce it freely, provided you:

* Do not omit or alter this copyright notice.
* Do not omit or alter or omit the version number and date.
* Do not omit or alter the document's pointer to the current WWW version.

2. History

This was originally a mini-HOWTO maintained by Jim Haynes. I have changed the
emphasis somewhat, trying to make it more a standalone document and less
reliant on the various USENET bibliographic postings. The unattributed mini-
reviews are mine rather than his.
