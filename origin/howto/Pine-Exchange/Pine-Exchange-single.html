>This HOWTO will provide you the required information on setting up Pine to
connect seamlessly to an Exchange Server. The services include the following:

>    Seamless configuration meaning that you can switch between
    Exchange/Outlook/Pine clients without any problems. (Pine will not mess up
    your existing configuration if you wish to revert back to Outlook)

><LI
><P
>    Have a working knowledge of the Pine email client (There is little to no
    documentation in this HOWTO on using Pine). If you need more information
    on using Pine, check out their main website. (see Resources) 
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    A username/password in order to log into the Exchange Server (Exchange
    servers run in a Microsoft domain, so your Exchange logon will be the same  
    as your domain logon).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Befriend the SysAdmin of your Exchange Server (You may or may not need the
    help of this person depending on which services are running).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    The Exchange Server must be version 5.5 or greater (Exchange did not
    support IMAP until 5.5).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Pine started supporting IMAP with v2.0 and LDAP with v4.0. I would
    recommend upgrading to the newest version, at the release of this document
    v4.44 or at least v4.0 or greater.

      access to all your messages and folders on the Exchange Server.

      outgoing Internet email.

>4. Exchange Server Configuration</A
></H2
><P
>Before starting to work on your Pine configuration, you must make sure that the
Exchange Server is configured correctly. This is where your SysAdmin comes in to
play. You need to make sure the IMAP, SMTP, and LDAP services are all running.
These services could potentially be running on separate servers, so you need to
consult your SysAdmin.</P
><P
>On Exchange Server 5.5, IMAP and LDAP are installed and running in the default
installation. SMTP has to be installed separately, and comes in an add-on package
called Microsoft Exchange Connector, specifically for sending mail on the
Internet.</P
><P
>NOTE: You can manually check to see if these services are running by telneting
to their respective ports. (ie. IMAP:143, SMTP:25, and LDAP:389)</P

NAME="PINE"
>5. Pine Configuration</A
></H2
><P
>Pine has three types of configuration files we will concern ourselves with. Each
of them can contain all the same settings, but with varied syntax. The decreasing
order of precedence for each setting is as follows: /etc/pine.conf.fixed,
~/.pinerc, and /etc/pine.conf. Basically this means if Pine is looking for a
specific setting it first checks pine.conf.fixed, if it does not exist it checks
~/.pinerc, if it does not exist it finally checks /etc/pine.conf.

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>    ~/.pinerc -- This is the local user copy of the configuration file. It is
    located in the root of the users home directory it only affects that user.
    You should use this configuration if you do not have superusers/root access
    on the computer on which you are using Pine. To generate a new configuration
    file of this type, you issue the command 'pine -pinerc .pinerc.new'.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    /etc/pine.conf -- This is the site-wide Pine configuration file, so it
    affects all the users running Pine on that machine (It can only be installed
    by the superuser/root account). The syntax is slightly different than the
    ~/.pinerc file since it has to represent all the users on the system, not
    just one. To generate a new configuration file of this type, you issue the
    command 'pine -conf &#62; pine.conf.new'.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    /etc/pine.conf.fixed -- This has exactly the same purpose and syntax as the
    /etc/pine.conf file, except for one property. This file is not overridden
    by the users ~/.pinerc file. Basically all the settings in this file are
    enforced, and cannot be changed by the user. Initially this file should be
    empty. You should add settings to it as needed.
    </P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>Each of these files contain settings in the form of "key=value" pairings. You
can change these settings with your favorite editor (ex. vi). For the ~/.pinerc
file the user can change the settings directly from Pine, by going into (S)etup
then (C)onfig. For LDAP settings go into (S)etup then (D)irectory.</P
><P
>Here are the important settings for communicating with the Exchange Server:</P
><P
>NOTE: The syntax of each setting will be shown in the Example configuration.

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>    user-domain -- The domain name portion of your email address (So if your
      email address is user@yourcompany.com, then yourcompany.com would be
      your user-domain).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    customized-hdrs -- This is the actually "From:" header that will appear in
    the message that you compose before you send it out. If you don't specify 
    this header, the user and full name are taken from the system
    /etc/passwd file. There are other variations to setting up the "From:"
    header (see Resources).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    smtp-server -- The hostname of your SMTP server. This may or may not be the
      same as your Exchange Server. (With SMTP Authentication you will need to
      specify a "/user" parameter on the end of this setting).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    inbox-path -- This contains the default path to your INBOX. (This should
      point to the remote INBOX on your Exchange/IMAP server).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    folder-collections -- This contains points to other folder collections you
      wish to view. There are only two sets you should concern yourself with.
      The first is your INBOX folders (personal folders you create in your
      INBOX), and the second is your Mailbox folders, which are default folders 
      (ie.  Sent Items, Deleted Items, Drafts, Outbox, Public Folders, etc.)
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    default-fcc -- This folder contains a carbon copy of all messages that you
      sent out. (This should point to the "Sent Items" folder on the Exchange
      server)
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    postponed-folder -- This folder contains postponed messages, that you wish
      to finish later. (If you are using Outlook, this should point to the
      "Drafts" folder on the Exchange server, otherwise you can create your own
      on the server)
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    ldap-server -- This is the hostname of your LDAP server. There are many
      parameters available for which you should consult your Pine documentation.
      (This will be used to access the Global Address List on the Exchange
      Server).
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    rsh-open-timeout -- Pine will use rsh to connect to IMAP by default.
      This is an Integer value which represents the timeout period. (Since
      Exchange servers don't run rsh, we are going to want to disable this
      feature by setting this value to 0).
    </P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>One potential problem that you may run into is SMTP Authentication. Basically,
this means that you need to provide a username and password to use SMTP to send
email. I have found no official documentation which states that Pine supports
SMTP Authentication (more so on the contrary). The closest thing I've found is
the possibility of a /user Parameter to the smtp-server setting, which was
mentioned briefly in the change log from version 4.20 to 4.21. It was also
brought up a couple of times on the listserv. (see Resources)</P
><P
>If you still have problems with it, here is an alternative which I ended up
using. You can have your SysAdmin add your IP address to the Exchange
Server to allow you to bypass the SMTP authentication.</P

on how much control you need to give to the users. If your company only
uses Exchange, maybe all the settings should go in fixed, but then users couldn't
use Pine for anything else. Remember, if you put a setting in pine.conf.fixed,
the user does not have the option to change it.</P

automatically try to connect to your Exchange/IMAP Server. After establishing a

new message, and type in a name in the "To:" box. Pine will first check your
local addressbook for the nickname. If it doesn't find it, it will then run an
LDAP query by default, using the default name you typed as the search string.
Depending on the speed of the LDAP server, you should get a response
relatively quickly. From the results you can choose the entry you were looking
for, and continue writing your email.</P

search or any other addressbook search (ie. user@smtp.email.org).</P

can go directly to your addressbook, select the LDAP server, and type the
search string from there (ie (M)ain, (A)ddressbook).</P

compose a new message, you can change the parameter "/impl=1" in the
