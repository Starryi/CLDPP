attention by Eric S Raymond, <span class="emphasis"><em>esr@thyrsus.com</em></span>,
and Geoff Mackenzie, <span class="emphasis"><em>freon@dialstart.net</em></span>, there
is an humourously illustrative definition of BogoMips as ''the
number of million times per second a processor can do absolutely
nothing.''</p><p>On a more precise basis, from mail from Lars Wirzenius,
<span class="emphasis"><em>wirzeniu@kruuna.Helsinki.FI</em></span>, dated 9 September
1993, explaining BogoMips, with additional detailed information by
Alessandro Rubini, <span class="emphasis"><em>rubini@morgana.systemy.it</em></span>,
and by howto-author Wim van Dorst:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>`MIPS is short for Millions of Instructions
Per Second.  It is a measure for the computation speed of a program.
Like most such measures, it is more often abused than used properly
(it is very difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds
of computers).</p><p>BogoMips are Linus's own invention. The linux kernel version
0.99.11 (dated 11 July 1993) needed a timing loop (the time is
too short and/or needs to be too exact for a non-busy-loop method
of waiting), which must be calibrated to the processor speed of the
machine. Hence, the kernel measures at boot time how fast a certain
kind of busy loop runs on a computer. "Bogo" comes from "bogus",
i.e, something which is a fake. Hence, the BogoMips value gives some
indication of the processor speed, but it is way too unscientific to
be called anything but BogoMips.</p><p>The reasons (there are two) it is printed during boot-up is
that a) it is slightly useful for debugging and for checking that
the computers caches and turbo button work, and b) Linus loves to
chuckle when he sees confused people on the 
news.'</p></blockquote></div><p>BogoMips are being determined in
<code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/init/main.c</code> (simple C
algorithm, with a nice example of floating point arithmetic
within the fully integer kernel), and the pertaining
kernel variable <span class="emphasis"><em>loops_per_sec</em></span> is
used in several drivers for more serious purpose. The
actual delay function <code class="filename">udelay()</code> is in
assembler, and therefore each port has its own definition
in <code class="filename">/include/asm/delay.h</code>. The
<span class="emphasis"><em>loops_per_sec</em></span> variable and the
<code class="filename">udelay()</code> function are used in numerous drivers,
see:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="screen">
cd /usr/src/linux #or where else source is located
find . -name '*.[hcS]' -exec fgrep loops_per_sec {} /dev/null \;
find . -name '*.[hcS]' -exec fgrep udelay {} /dev/null \;
</pre></blockquote></div><p>The BogoMips calculation loop for the non Intel CPUs is similar
but not the same, because it is programmed in another assembler
language. BogoMips is however the only portable way over the various
CPUs (Intel-type and non Intel-type) for getting an indication of the
CPU speed. Even CPU clock speed is not available on all CPUs. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm149"></a>3.2. How to estimate what the proper BogoMips rating should be</h3></div></div></div><p>From a initiative by Ian Jackson,

applicable for non-Linux systems such as Crays, Palm PDAs,
DOS, and similar, may be a standalone BogoMips program. Some
versions are currently available, viz., by Darrick Wong,
<span class="emphasis"><em>djwong@thibs.menloschool.org</em></span>, and by Philip
Snowdon, <span class="emphasis"><em>philips@users.sf.net</em></span>. Jeff Tranter,
<span class="emphasis"><em>jeff_tranter@mitel.com</em></span> was the original
author. From his readme file:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>`Tired of rebooting your system so you can
see how many BogoMips it's running at today?  [...] "Bogomips" is a
standalone program that displays your system performance using one
of the world's most recognized benchmarks.  It uses the same code
that is used in the Linux kernel while booting, but runs as a user
program. [...] Version 1.3 of BogoMips is now portable and should run
on any system that supports an ANSI C compiler and 
library.'</p></blockquote></div><p>Note that due to system load values calculated with a standalone
program on Linux systems may be quite different from registered
in the list below. Intrinsically a standalone program cannot give
precisely similar information to the boot sequence BogoMips, since
system load will compete with the program run by an ordinary user.
Therefore only boot sequence BogoMips ratings are listed below.</p><p>Be aware that Jeff's original file on
<code class="filename">sunsite.unc.edu</code>, named
<code class="filename">/pub/Linux/system/status/bogo-1.2.tar.gz</code>,
internally designated version 1.3,
is rather outdated. Therefore, check out Darrick's program on
<code class="filename">http://thibs.menloschool.org/~djwong/programs/bogomips/</code>,
if still reachable. He even has a MSW*nd*ws binary version. And
very interestingly, Phil Snowdon has developed the PalmOS version,
to be found at <code class="filename">http://bogomips.sourceforge.net</code>.

variation one may see in the BogoMips rating, in c.o.l.development,
at 28 April 1994</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>`The BogoMips calculation loop is
"quantizised", so you're most likely to get the exact same number
all the time.  You usually will get different numbers only if the
speed is just on the "edge", when small variations (different time
for interrupt ticks etc) will make it jump from one value to the
other.'</p></blockquote></div><p>If a kernel is not compiled specifically for the pertaining CPU,
also some (even large) variations of the BogoMips ratings can occur,
mainly due to erroneous alignment. This problem apparently only occurs
on the various x86 CPUs (Intel and clones). Fortunately it can easily
be solved: recompile the kernel specifically for your CPU.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm192"></a>3.5. New BogoMips algorithm?</h3></div></div></div><p>No, the BogoMips algorithm, contrarily to popular believe, did
NOT change over the various kernel versions. Furthermore, it is
intrinsically the same for all CPUs of all makes.</p><p>What did change from kernel version 2.2.13 to 2.2.14 is the CPU state
setting just before the BogoMips calculation. This affects the
BogoMips rating for all Intel and AMD Pentium variations, resulting
in approximately 2*clock, if they were not 2*clock already.</p><p>The entries based on these upgraded kernel versions for CPUs
where this change was actually relevant for (Pentium II/III,

e.g., by Lily, <span class="emphasis"><em>lbliao@alumni.caltech.edu</em></span>, and by 
Pierre Frenkiel, <span class="emphasis"><em>frenkiel@cdfap2.in2p3.fr</em></span>. In 
March 1995 they asked:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>`When I boot Linux I get the message:
</p><pre class="screen">
      Calibrating delay loop.. ok - 23.96 BogoMips

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="screen">
      Calibrating delay loop.. failed

may not have in your machine. Just after calculating the BogoMips
rating all device drivers are initiated.  First the SCSI devices,
then Net devices, etc.  Any failure is duly reported. Noteworthy
is the AHA152x driver. Other effects of failing drivers (and not of
failing BogoMips calculations) are systems crashes, long waits, and
complete system locks, somewhere close to (just before or just after)
outputting the ok - xx.xx BogoMips text.</p><p>Since Linux 1.2 many error messages have improved, so upgrade
to at least that version to find out which particular driver it is
that is failing. Also recompile the kernel to only include the drivers
that are actually needed for your hardware configuration.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm211"></a>3.7. What about clone CPUs (Cyrix, NexGen, AMD, etc)</h3></div></div></div><p>Cyrix 486-like CPUs need cache enabling software, sometimes
referred to as BogoBoost software. Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 CPUs may
have their BogoMips improved drastically by branch-prediction (BIOS
option). Note that the performance improvement may be marginal. There
are several packages available for adjusting Cyrix CPUs, such as the
BogoBoost patch, cx5x86mod, and set6x86, all from the normal archives,
in obvious places. It is reported the Cyrix 6x86 CPUs may give
better performance when the kernel is compiled with 486-optimization,
instead Pentium-optimization.</p><p>NexGen 386-enhanced CPUs, marked as Nx586, are listed as
386-like, since the fact that they are performing like Pentium machines
is not relevant to BogoMips.</p><p>AMD 5x86, also denoted as AMD 486DX5, are quadrupled 486/33
machines. They are fully in line with other 486 CPUs. The AMD
K5 and the K6 are Pentium-like CPUs, with their own BogoMips
multipliers.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm216"></a>3.8. Why to pay attention to BogoMips</h3></div></div></div><p>Let me add that there are only two reasons for paying attention

  using benchmarks, has it? :-) </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note of the author: this remark was made somewhere in 
  the mid nineties when comparing high BogoMips rates for some 
  low-capacity CPUs with high clockrates (e.g., 486) to rates for
