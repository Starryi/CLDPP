>OK - your PPP connection is up and running and you can ping the PPP
server by IP number (the second or "remote" IP number shown by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ifconfig
ppp0</TT
>), but you can't reach anything beyond this.</P
><P
>First of all, try pinging the IP numbers you have specified in
/etc/resolv.conf as name servers. If this works, you <EM
>can</EM
> see beyond your
PPP server (unless this has the same IP number as the "remote" IP number
of your connection). So now try pinging the full Internet name of your
service provider - eg</P

>If this does NOT work, you have a problem with the name resolution. This
is probably because of a typo in your /etc/resolv.conf file. Check this
carefully against the information you acquired by ringing your service
provider. If all looks OK, ring your service provider and check that you
wrote down the IP numbers correctly.</P
><P
>If it STILL doesn't work (and your service provider confirms that his
name servers are up and running), you have a problem somewhere else -
and I suggest you check carefully through your Linux installation
(looking particularly for file permissions).</P
><P
>If you STILL can't ping your service provider's IP name servers by IP number,
either they are down (give them a voice call and check) or there is a
routing problem at your service provider's end. Again, ring them and
check this out.</P
><P
>One possibility is that the "remote end" is a Linux PPP server where the
IP forwarding option has not been specified in the kernel!</P
><P
>A good general test is to try connecting to your service provider using
the software that most supply for (gulp) Microsoft Windows. If
everything works from another operating system to exactly the same
account, then the problem is with your Linux system and NOT your service
provider.</P
