standard PC set up is to have com1 and com3 share IRQ4 and com2 and com4
share IRQ3.</P

>If you have devices on standard serial ports that share an IRQ with your
modem you are going to have problems. You need to make sure that your
modem serial port is on its own, unique IRQ. Many modern serial cards
(and better quality motherboard serial ports) allow you to move the IRQ
of the serial ports around.</P

>If you are running Linux kernel 2, you can check the in-use IRQs using

>This shows a serial port on IRQ4 (a mouse) and a serial port
on IRQ15 (the permanent modem based PPP link to the Internet. (There is
also a serial port on com2, IRQ3 and com4 is on IRQ14, but as they are
not in use, they do not show up).</P

>Be warned - you need to know what you are doing if you are going to play
with your IRQs! Not only do you have to open up you computer, pull out
cards and play with jumpers, but you need to know what is on which IRQ.
In my case, this is a totally SCSI based PC, and so I can disable the "on
motherboard" IDE interfaces that normally use IRQ14 and 15!</P
><P
>You should also remember that if your PC boots other operating systems,
moving IRQs around may well mean that OS cannot boot properly - or at all!</P
><P
>If you do move your serial ports to non-standard IRQs, then you need to
tell Linux which IRQ each port is using. This is done using "
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>setserial</TT
>" and is best done as part of the boot process in
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc.local</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc.serial</TT
> which is called from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc.local</TT
> or as
part of the SysV initialization. For the machine illustrated above, the
commands used are...

>However, if you are using serial modules dynamically loaded, when
required by the <TT

(etc.) once at boot time. This is because if the serial module is unloaded,
Linux forgets the special settings.</P

reconfigure the IRQs, (etc.) each time the module is loaded.</P
