></H1
><P
>PPP is strictly a <EM
>peer to peer</EM
> protocol; there is (technically) no
difference between the machine that dials in and the machine that is
dialed into. However, for clarity's sake, it is useful to think in terms
of <EM
>servers</EM
> and <EM
>clients</EM
>.</P
><P
>When you dial into a site to establish a PPP connection, you are a
<EM
>client</EM
>. The machine to which you connect is the <EM
>server</EM
>.</P
><P
>When you are setting up a Linux box to receive and handle dial-in PPP
connections, you are setting up a PPP <EM
>server</EM
>.</P
><P
>Any Linux PC can be both a PPP server and client - even
simultaneously if you have more than one serial port (and modem if
necessary). As stated above, there is no real difference between clients
and servers as far as PPP is concerned, once the connection is made.</P
><P
>This document refers to the machine that initiates the call (that dials
in) as the <EM
>CLIENT</EM
>, whilst the machine that answers the telephone,
checks the authentication of the dial in request (using user names,
passwords and possibly other mechanisms) is referred to as the
<EM
>SERVER</EM
>.</P
><P
>The use of PPP as a client to link one or more machines at a location
into the Internet is, probably, the one in which  most people are
interested - that is using their Linux PC as a client.</P
><P
>The procedure described in this document will allow you to
establish and automate your Internet connection.</P
><P
>This document will also give you guidance in setting up your Linux PC as
a PPP <EM
>server</EM
> and in linking two LANs together (with full routing)
using PPP (this is frequently characterized as establishing a WAN - wide
area network - link).</P
