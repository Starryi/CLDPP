>Even for dynamic IP numbers, you can certainly configure sendmail on your
machine to send out any email that you compose locally. Configuration of
sendmail can be obscure and difficult - so this document does not
attempt to tell you how to do this. However, you should probably
configure sendmail so that your Internet service provider is designated
as your "smart relay" host (the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sendmail.cf</TT
> <EM
>DS</EM
> option). (For more
sendmail configuration info, see the sendmail documents - and look at the
m4 configurations that come with sendmail. There is almost certain to be
one there that will meet your needs).</P
><P
>There are also excellent books on Sendmail (notably the 'bible' from
O'Reilly and Associates), but these are almost certainly overkill for
most users!</P
><P
>Once you have sendmail configured, you will probably want to have
sendmail dispatch any messages that have been sitting in the outbound
mail queue as soon as the PPP connection comes up. To do this, add the
command</P

If you can, you should also set your FROM address to be your email
