>This section lists the CD-ROM drivers and interfaces that are
currently supported under Linux. The information here is based on the
latest stable Linux kernel, which at time of writing was version
2.4.4.</P

>This information is valid for Linux on the Intel x86 platform. Much
of it is applicable to Linux on other processor architectures as
well.</P

>3.1. ATAPI CD-ROM Drives</A
></H2
><P
>ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) is a protocol for
controlling mass storage devices. It builds on the ATA (AT Attachment)
interface, the official ANSI standard name for the IDE interface
developed for hard disk drives. ATAPI is commonly used for hard disks,
CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and other devices. Currently the most
popular type of interface, it offers most of the functionality of
SCSI, without the need for an expensive controller or cables.</P
><P
>The Linux kernel has a device driver that should work with any ATAPI
compliant CD-ROM drive. Vendors shipping compatible drives include
Aztech, Mitsumi, NEC, Sony, Creative Labs, and Vertos. If you have
recently purchased a CD-ROM drive, especially if it is quad speed or
faster, it is almost guaranteed to be IDE/ATAPI.</P
><P
>Linux also has an IDE SCSI emulation kernel driver that
makes an IDE/ATAPI device appear in software to be a SCSI device,
allowing the use of a SCSI device driver instead of the native ATAPI
driver. This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD or CDR drive);
you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI
device driver.</P

>3.2. SCSI CD-ROM Drives</A
></H2
><P
>SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) is a popular format
for CD-ROM drives. Its chief advantages are a reasonably fast transfer
rate, multi-device capability, and support on a variety of computer
platforms. Some disadvantages of SCSI are the need for a relatively
expensive controller card and cables.</P
><P
>Any SCSI CD-ROM drive with a block size of 512 or 2048
bytes should work under Linux; this includes the vast majority of
CD-ROM drives on the market.</P
><P
>You will also need a supported SCSI controller card; see the
<A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/SCSI-HOWTO"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux SCSI HOWTO</A
>
for more information on interface hardware.</P
><P
>Note that some older CD-ROM drives use a proprietary controller with a
modified interface that is not fully SCSI compatible (e.g. it may not
support adding other SCSI devices on the bus). These will most likely
<EM
>not</EM
> work under Linux.</P

>3.3. Proprietary CD-ROM Drives</A
></H2
><P
>Several CD-ROM drives using proprietary interfaces are
available; the interface is often provided on a sound card. Simple
interface cards equivalent to that provided on the sound card are also
available. These drives generally tend to be lower in cost and
smaller than SCSI drives. Their disadvantages are the lack of
standardization and expandability.</P
><P
>Note that proprietary interfaces are sometimes erroneously referred to
as IDE interfaces, because like IDE hard disks, they use a simple
interface based on the PC/AT bus. To add to the confusion, some
vendors, most notably Creative Labs, have shipped many different types
of CD-ROM drives and have offered proprietary, SCSI, and ATAPI
interfaces on their sound cards.</P
><P
>The table below lists the proprietary CD-ROM drives that are known to
be supported under Linux. Drivers for additional devices may be
available in the latest development kernels or as kernel patches. The
latter can most often be found at
<A
HREF="ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/cdrom/"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/cdrom/</A
>.
Also check the documentation files included with the kernel distribution,
usually installed in <TT

common error among Linux CD-ROM users is to assume that any drive
connected to a SoundBlaster card should use the SBPCD
driver</EM

selling proprietary interface drives, they are following the standard
ATAPI/IDE interface.</P
