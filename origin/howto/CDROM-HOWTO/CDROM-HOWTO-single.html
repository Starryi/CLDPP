>Don't Panic! The world of CD-ROM technology is not as
confusing as your instruction manual.</P
><P
>CD-ROM stands for <EM
>Compact Disc Read-Only Memory</EM
>, a mass
storage medium utilizing an optical laser to read microscopic pits on
the aluminized layer of a polycarbonate disc. The same format is used
for audio Compact Discs. Because of its high storage capacity,
reliability, and low cost, CD-ROM has become an increasingly popular
storage media.</P
><P
>The storage capacity of a CD-ROM disc is approximately 650 megabytes,
equivalent to over 500 high density 3.5" floppy disks or roughly
250,000 typed pages.</P
><P
>First generation drives (known as <EM
>single speed</EM
>), provided a
transfer rate of approximately 150 kilobytes per second. Hardware
manufacturers then introduced double speed (300 kB/sec), quad speed
(600 kB/sec), and higher. Current drives operate at up to 40 times
speed, although the maximum rate is only achievable over certain
portions of the disc surface.</P
><P
>Most CD-ROM drives use either the Small Computer Systems Interface
(SCSI), ATAPI enhanced IDE interface, or a vendor proprietary
interface. They also typically support playing audio CDs via an
external headphone jack or line level output. Most drives also allow
reading the frames of data from audio CDs in digital form.</P
><P
>CD-ROMs are usually formatted with an ISO-9660 (formerly
called <EM
>High Sierra</EM
>) file system. This format
restricts filenames to the MS-DOS style (8+3 characters). The
<EM
>Rock Ridge Extensions</EM
> use undefined fields in the
ISO-9660 standard to support longer filenames and additional Unix
style information (e.g. file ownership, symbolic links, etc.).
Microsoft has defined a proprietary ISO file system extension called
Joliet which supports long filenames using the 16-bit UNICODE
character encoding.</P
><P
><EM
>PhotoCD</EM
> is a standard developed by Kodak for
storing photographic images as digital data on a CD-ROM. With
appropriate software, you can view the images on a computer,
manipulate them, or send them to a printer. Information can be added
to a PhotoCD at a later date; this is known as
<EM
>multi-session</EM
> capability.</P
><P
>CD recordable (CD-R) drives allow writing onto a special "gold" CD which can
then be read by any CD-ROM drive. Data can only be written once,
although using multi-session new data can be appended to a disc.</P
><P
>CD-RW (rewritable) drives can be erased and rewritten with new data.
They use special discs which can be read by most recent CD-ROM
drives (but not older ones or most audio CD players).</P
><P
>DVD-ROM expands the storage of a CD to as much as 17 gigabytes. They
are commonly used as a medium for distributing full length motion
pictures encoded using the MPEG-2 format. The MPEG video decoding is
performed using specialized decoder software and/or hardware. DVD-RAM
is a writable version of DVD.</P

>3.1. ATAPI CD-ROM Drives</A
></H3
><P
>ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) is a protocol for
controlling mass storage devices. It builds on the ATA (AT Attachment)
interface, the official ANSI standard name for the IDE interface
developed for hard disk drives. ATAPI is commonly used for hard disks,
CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and other devices. Currently the most
popular type of interface, it offers most of the functionality of
SCSI, without the need for an expensive controller or cables.</P
><P
>The Linux kernel has a device driver that should work with any ATAPI
compliant CD-ROM drive. Vendors shipping compatible drives include
Aztech, Mitsumi, NEC, Sony, Creative Labs, and Vertos. If you have
recently purchased a CD-ROM drive, especially if it is quad speed or
faster, it is almost guaranteed to be IDE/ATAPI.</P
><P
>Linux also has an IDE SCSI emulation kernel driver that
makes an IDE/ATAPI device appear in software to be a SCSI device,
allowing the use of a SCSI device driver instead of the native ATAPI
driver. This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD or CDR drive);
you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI
device driver.</P

>3.2. SCSI CD-ROM Drives</A
></H3
><P
>SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) is a popular format
for CD-ROM drives. Its chief advantages are a reasonably fast transfer
rate, multi-device capability, and support on a variety of computer
platforms. Some disadvantages of SCSI are the need for a relatively
expensive controller card and cables.</P
><P
>Any SCSI CD-ROM drive with a block size of 512 or 2048
bytes should work under Linux; this includes the vast majority of
CD-ROM drives on the market.</P
><P
>You will also need a supported SCSI controller card; see the
<A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/SCSI-HOWTO"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux SCSI HOWTO</A
>
for more information on interface hardware.</P
><P
>Note that some older CD-ROM drives use a proprietary controller with a
modified interface that is not fully SCSI compatible (e.g. it may not
support adding other SCSI devices on the bus). These will most likely
<EM
>not</EM
> work under Linux.</P

>3.3. Proprietary CD-ROM Drives</A
></H3
><P
>Several CD-ROM drives using proprietary interfaces are
available; the interface is often provided on a sound card. Simple
interface cards equivalent to that provided on the sound card are also
available. These drives generally tend to be lower in cost and
smaller than SCSI drives. Their disadvantages are the lack of
standardization and expandability.</P
><P
>Note that proprietary interfaces are sometimes erroneously referred to
as IDE interfaces, because like IDE hard disks, they use a simple
interface based on the PC/AT bus. To add to the confusion, some
vendors, most notably Creative Labs, have shipped many different types
of CD-ROM drives and have offered proprietary, SCSI, and ATAPI
interfaces on their sound cards.</P
><P
>The table below lists the proprietary CD-ROM drives that are known to
be supported under Linux. Drivers for additional devices may be
available in the latest development kernels or as kernel patches. The
latter can most often be found at

The
<A

has more information on installing
Linux. If you purchased Linux on CD-ROM, it likely also came with some
installation instructions (that little booklet inside the jewel case,
and/or files on the CD).</P

>Once Linux has initially been installed, most users will want to
compile their own kernel, usually for one of these reasons:

<P

><UL
><LI
><P
>to support a CD-ROM drive or other hardware</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>to upgrade to a newer kernel release</P
></LI

></UL
>

The
<A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Kernel HOWTO</A
>
should be consulted for the details of
building a kernel. I will just mention here some issues
that are specific to CD-ROM drives.</P
><P
>Obviously, you need to compile in support for your CD-ROM drive when
you configure the kernel.</P
><P
>If you have an ATAPI CD-ROM drive, you need to enable
<EM
>Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape support</EM
> and
<EM
>Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support</EM
>.</P
><P
>For SCSI CD-ROM drives, enable the options <EM
>SCSI
support</EM
> and <EM
>SCSI CDROM support</EM
>. Also
enable support for your SCSI host adapter when prompted, e.g.
<EM
>Adaptec AHA152X/2825 support</EM
>.</P
><P
>For proprietary interface CD-ROM drives, enable the appropriate
driver. You can use the table listed previously to determine the
driver to use for your model.</P
><P
>Virtually all CD-ROMs use the ISO-9660 file system, so you must
also enable <EM
>ISO 9660 CDROM filesystem support</EM
>.</P
><P
>Although not needed for CD-ROM operation, if you have a sound card
that is supported under Linux you might want to enable and configure
the kernel sound driver at this time as well. The
<A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/LDP/HOWTO/Sound-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Sound HOWTO</A
>
can be a useful reference here.</P
><P
>You should then follow the usual procedure for building the kernel and
installing it. Don't boot with the new kernel until you create the
device files and set up any boot time parameters as described in the
next section.</P
><P
>The ISO-9660 filesystem and almost all of the CD-ROM drivers can be
built as loadable kernel modules. This scheme allows the
kernel drivers to be loaded and unloaded without rebooting the kernel,
freeing up memory. I recommend you get your CD-ROM installation
running using compiled-in drivers first. How to use modules is
described in the modules documentation and the
<A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Kernel HOWTO</A
>.</P
><P
>If a drive type listed here is not supported by your kernel, you
likely need to upgrade to a newer version.</P
><P
>It is possible that you need to use a driver that is distributed
separately from the kernel source code. This usually involves patching
the kernel. Again, the
<A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Kernel HOWTO</A
>
explains how to do this.</P
><P
>Note that you can configure the kernel using the text-based program
using "make config", a menu-based kernel configuration program invoked
by "make menuconfig" and an X11-based graphical configuration invoked
as "make xconfig". All three configuration methods offer on-line help.</P

>4.3. Creating Device Files and Setting Boot Time Parameters</A
></H3
><P
>The kernel uses device files to identify which device driver to use.
If you are running a standard Linux distribution you may have created
the necessary device files during installation. Under Slackware
Linux, for example, there is a menu-based <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>setup</TT
> tool that
includes CD-ROM setup, and most systems have a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/MAKEDEV</TT
>
script. If you don't use these methods, you can use the more manual
procedure listed in this section. Even if you use either of these
methods, it is recommended that you at least verify the device files
against the information in this section.</P
><P
>If you are using the new devfs file system in the 2.4 kernels, the
device files are created dynamically by the kernel rather than
residing on disk, and follow a different naming convention. The
examples in this document assume that devfs is not being used, and may
need to be adjusted accordingly if you are.</P
><P
>You create the device file by running the shell commands indicated for
your drive type. This should be done as user <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root</TT
>. Note that
some Linux distributions may use slightly different CD-ROM device
names from those listed here.</P
><P
>I recommended that you also create a symbolic link to the CD-ROM
device to make it easier to remember. For example, for an IDE CD-ROM
drive that is the second device on the secondary interface, the link
would be created using</P

>Some Linux distributions use group permissions to control access to
devices such as CD-ROMs. A common convention is to only allow members
of a group called cdrom to have access. In this case you should add
the appropriate users to the group rather than changing file
permissions on the device file.</P
><P
>When booting Linux, the device drivers attempt to determine whether
the appropriate devices are present, typically by probing specific
addresses. Many of the drivers auto-probe at several addresses, but
because of differences in configuration, possible device conflicts,
and hardware limitations, the drivers sometimes need help identifying
the addresses and other parameters. Most drivers support an option on
the kernel command line to pass this information to the device
driver. This can be done interactively, or more commonly, configured
into your boot loader. With LILO, for example, you would
add an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>append</TT
> command such as the following to your
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT

jumpers for addressing, check that they are set correctly (e.g. drive
0 if you have only one drive). ATAPI CD-ROMS must be jumpered as
"single" or "master", and not "slave" when only one IDE device is
attached to an interface. If the drive works under DOS then you can be
reasonably confident that the hardware is working.</P

you to enter the parameters manually when booting.</P
