This document is to serve as a comprehensive HOWTO and <acronym class="acronym">FAQ</acronym> 
collection regarding the <span class="productname">Sun JavaStation <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>
</span>&#8482; and enabling the <span class="application"><acronym class="acronym">GNU</acronym>/Linux 
<acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> </span> on it.
</p><p>
The intended audience of this document is anyone who has an interest
in enabling <span class="application">Linux</span> on the <span class="productname">Sun 
JavaStations</span>&#8482;.  The document structure is laid out to 
serve as either a top-to-bottom read for a newcomer, or as quick 
reference on a single topic for advanced users.  Pointers
to sample files submitted by users are included for 
extremely hurried readers.
</p><p>
The author of this document is Robert Dubinski 
<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:rsd@dubinski-family.org">rsd@dubinski-family.org</a>&gt;</code>.  Robert is the former 
computer technician and UNIX systems administrator for 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.marquette.edu" target="_top">Marquette University's</a> 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mscs.mu.edu" target="_top"> Math, Statistics and Computer 
Science Department</a>, where he had 
125 <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; running 
<span class="application">Linux</span>.  These machines were 
all configured using the information, techniques and files 
presented in this document.
</p><p>
In early 1999, Eric Brower  <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:ebrower@usa.net">ebrower@usa.net</a>&gt;</code> wrote the 
first informal HOWTO for the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;.  Parts 
of this document are inspired by his work, and all unique information 
presented there have since been merged into this document.  Eric's 
original mini-HOWTO is saved for posterity at:

Pete got me going with <span class="application">Linux</span> on the 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; in December 1998, has 
been the main kernel programmer adding in support for the 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; line, and despite his busy 
work schedule was nice enough to find time to answer all my email 
queries for help over the last 15 months. 
</p><p>
Eric worked on bringing <span class="application">X</span> support to the 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; when it had none.
He had been working on a dedicated server for the <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482; in early 1999, and kept me informed of 
his progress.  In mid-1999, he switched tactics and sent a working 
framebuffer example to test out.  He also wrote the first comprehensive 
mini-HOWTO for the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;, 
answered my email questions, and got me interested in the embedded
solution which I employ here at Marquette.
</p><p>
Thank-you Pete and Eric!

This chapter explains to the reader what the <span class="productname">JavaStation

</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> is a 
model line of network computers built and sold by 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sun.com" target="_top">Sun Microsystems</a> between 
November 1996 and March 2000.  The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
line was Sun's low-cost terminal option during that timeframe.   It
was the marketed successor to the Xterminal 1 and is succeeeded by the
SunRay, although all three machines are fundamentally different.
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; hardware ran Sun's 
own <span class="application">JavaOS</span> and either Sun's <span class="application">
Hotjava</span> web browser, Sun's <span class="application">HotJava Views
</span> task-manager software, or custom <span class="application">Java
</span> applications of the customer's choice. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; was originally billed in 
November 1996 sneak previews as a low-cost desktop terminal, 
providing customers access to hot new <span class="application">Java</span> 
applications, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="application">X</span> applications, 
and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="application">MS Windows</span> apps.  
During its lifetime, The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;'s marketed 
functionality was changed twice from <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop terminal</span>&#8221;</span> to 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">single-app desktop device</span>&#8221;</span> to finally a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">browser-based 
kiosk device</span>&#8221;</span>.
</p><p>
At no time did Sun market the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; as 
capable of running its flagship 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sun.com/solaris" target="_top">Solaris</a> operating system 
the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux.com" target="_top">Linux OS</a>, or any other
OS than Sun's JavaOS.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="WhatIsNCSection"></a>2.2. Definition of an <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> including the Differentiation 
from <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s</h3></div></div></div><p>
A network computer, or <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>, was hailed as 
"the next big thing" in computing from late 1995 to early 1998.  
Conventional <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s, called "fat clients", were 
expected to be minimized in businesses by thin-client 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s. 
</p><p>
Thin-clients get their <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym>, applications, and data 
files entirely through the network.  They are different from 
dumb-terminals;  they run full-scale graphical applications.  
Thin-clients are also different than graphical X-terminals.  
X-terminals typically run an X server and display the client programs of 
a remote server.  Thin clients generally run full-scale graphical 
programs locally, such as a web browser, a <span class="application">Java</span> 
application, or a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy-connectivity program</span>&#8221;</span>, which enables 
the thin-client to display <span class="application">X</span> apps or 
<span class="application">MS Windows</span> apps which run on more
powerful servers. 
</p><p>
Advantages of <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s include: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Zero-Administration</span>&#8221;</span>.  (Add a new <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> and 
it will get <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> it needs off the network, 
without an admin ever needing to visit it.)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Lower Total-Cost-of-Ownership (<acronym class="acronym">TCO</acronym>) (No internal 
hard drives, floppy drives or <acronym class="acronym">CD</acronym> players reduces 
form-factor, repair expenses, selling price and thus total-cost-of-ownership.)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Access to all web-based apps as well as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="application">X
</span> and <span class="application">MS Windows</span> apps.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Quick upgrades (just upgrade your server and the changes propogate throughout)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Longer lifespan (just upgrade the software, growing hard disk and memory 
requirements is not an issue)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Smaller <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> footprint (when running brower-based apps)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Disadvantages of <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
No local access to data files (all your files stored on a remote server)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Requires fast, stable networks
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
NC's generally have a low maximum amount of memory.  Though not as bad
as with fat-clients, this does eventually become a liability for the 
thin-client.

Line including Hardware Specs</h3></div></div></div><p>
Depending on who you talk to, the number of <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; models that were created is anywhere from one to six.  
The descriptions below will explain why. 
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="MrCoffeeDescSection"></a>2.3.1. 
<span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; [ <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8221;</span>] 
[<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">the brick</span>&#8221;</span>] [Sun Option No. JJ-xx]
</h4></div></div></div><p>
This model is the most prevalent <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; model 
you are likely to find, although it wasn't the one and only 
<span class="emphasis"><em><span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;</em></span> model Sun wished 
to sell to the public.  The <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; was the 
first generation <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;, released in 
November 1996 to pilot deployments as Sun's <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">proof of concept</span>&#8221;</span> 
of the Java <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> design.  
</p><p>
Hardware-wise, the <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; is a 
Sun4M architecture machine.  It is based on the <span class="productname">SPARCStation-4
</span>&#8482; design, with some deletions and <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>-like 
modifications.  It is powered by a <span class="hardware">110 Mhz MicroSPARC IIe 
CPU</span> and has no <span class="hardware">SCSI</span>, <span class="hardware">internal disks
</span>, <span class="hardware">floppy</span>, <span class="hardware">CD</span> or 
<span class="hardware">expansion slots</span>.  The <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee
</span>&#8482; <span class="hardware">motherboard</span> is Sun Part 
No. <span class="productnumber">501-3141</span>. 
</p><p>
Instead of using the Sun-type <span class="hardware">keyboard</span> and 
<span class="hardware">mice</span>, <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; 
uses <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>-like <span class="hardware">PS2</span> parts instead.  
One of the original marketing highlights of the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; was that it would use standard <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym> parts 
wherever possible to keep overall price down. 
</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">brick</span>&#8221;</span> has four <span class="hardware">PC-like SIMM</span> 
slots.  The <span class="hardware">SIMMs</span> taken are industry-standard 
60ns, 32-bit, 72-pin, 5V fast page <span class="hardware">SIMMs</span>, 
installed in pairs.  Each slot is capable of holding up to a 
<span class="hardware">16MB SIMM</span>, bringing the maximum total capacity 
of the unit to 64MB.  The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xx</span>&#8221;</span> in the Sun Option# of the 
unit indicated how much memory the unit shipped with.
</p><p>
For video display, the <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; utilizes 
the <span class="hardware">Sun TCX framebuffer</span>, capable of 1024x768@70Hz in 
8-bit color.  The port connector however, is a <span class="hardware">standard VGA jack
</span>, enabling the user to use standard <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym> 
<span class="hardware">monitors</span> if desired (again, low cost in mind).  
The <span class="hardware">on-board audio</span> is a <span class="hardware">Crystal CS4231 chip
</span>, and the network interface is the <span class="hardware">Sun Lance</span> 
10Mbps interface.  In addition, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">brick</span>&#8221;</span> also came with 
a <span class="hardware">9-pin serial port</span> and <span class="hardware">1/8" audio out jack
</span> on its back.  
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; was fitted into the Sun 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unidisk</span>&#8221;</span> form factor case, and has been seen in a number 
of color schemes.  <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; have been 
fitted with casings in the white with light blue trim scheme used in 
<span class="hardware">Sun workstations</span>, as well as the dark blue-grey 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">new desktop</span>&#8221;</span> scheme.  Some say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>
and have the Java coffee cup logo written on it, others do not.  
Collectors may wish to collect all case variations.
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; was used in early 
Sun demos, and sold to pilot sites.  When first brought out, the 
cost to pilot sites was $699US.   This was at a time when <acronym class="acronym">PC
</acronym>'s were still higher than $1000US.  By the end of the pilot
run, Sun was selling any remaining or used units for $299-$399US, in
anticipation for its <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">real</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="productname">JavaStation

</h4></div></div></div><p>
This model is the second most prevalent <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
model you are likely to find.  When you talk to industry people about the 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>, this is typically the model remembered first.  
Delayed numerous times, the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; model 
officially went on sale to the general public Mar. 26, 1998 at the annual 
JavaOne conference. 
</p><p>
Though generation two of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; line, the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; model was <span class="emphasis"><em>the JavaStation</em></span>
.  Sporting a completely different board design than <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;, <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; establishes what was to be 
the characteristic <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; architecture. 
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; is powered by a 
<span class="hardware">100Mhz MicroSPARC IIep</span> chip, (note the 'p'). 
Its mainboard had the internal addition of a <span class="hardware">PCI bus</span>, 
about a year before this standard bus made its well-publicized 
appearance on the <span class="productname">Sun Ultra</span>&#8482; workstation 
line. The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; <span class="hardware">motherboard</span> 
is Sun Part no. <span class="productnumber">501-4267</span>.
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; keeps the <span class="hardware">PS2 keyboard</span> 
and <span class="hardware">PS2 mouse ports</span> from <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;, keeping in mind the low-cost, interoperable goal of 
generation 1. 
</p><p>
With the new board design, came new memory chip sockets.  Instead of
<span class="hardware">SIMMs</span>, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower</span>&#8221;</span> moved to <span class="hardware">
168-pin DIMMs</span>.  <span class="hardware">DIMMs</span> had begun to make 
their way from the workstation realm to <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s in the 
time between generations one and two of the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; line, so it was fitting for Sun to switch to
it in anticipation of their status low-cost commodity memory chips. The
<span class="hardware">DIMMs</span> accepted by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower</span>&#8221;</span> are 
<span class="hardware">168pin, 3.3V unbuffered EDO DIMMs (not SDRAM)</span>.  With 
two sockets capable of holding a <span class="hardware">32MB DIMM</span> each, the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; has a maximum capacity of 64<acronym class="acronym">MB
</acronym> <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>. As with the <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;, the number <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xx</span>&#8221;</span> in the Sun option number 
refers to the amount of memory shipped with the unit. 
</p><p>
For video display, the <span class="productname">JavaStation-NC</span>&#8482; utilizes 
the <span class="hardware">PCI-based IGS C1682 framebuffer</span>, 
capable of 1280x1024@80Hz in 24-bit <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">true color</span>&#8221;</span>.  This 
is a step up from the 8-bit display on <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;.  The port connector remained a <span class="hardware">standard VGA jack
</span> like <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;, enabling the 
user to use standard <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym> monitors if desired.
The on-board audio remains a <span class="hardware">Crystal 
CS4231 chip</span> like <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;. 
The network interface on <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; is the 
<span class="hardware">Sun HappyMeal</span> 10/100 Mbps interface, another step 
up from the original offering of <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;.
</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower</span>&#8221;</span> came with the <span class="hardware">9-pin serial port
</span> and <span class="hardware">1/8" audio out jack</span> as 
<span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;, but it also added a 
<span class="hardware">1/8" audio-in jack</span>, to do sound recording with. 
</p><p>
Another addition in the <span class="productname">JavaStation-NC</span>&#8482; is a 
<span class="hardware">flash memory SIMM</span>.  This allows one to load the 
current revision of the <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> onboard, increasing 
boot-speed tremendously. 
</p><p>
Perhaps the thing most memorable about the <span class="productname">JavaStation-NC
</span>&#8482; is its case design.  The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; 
comes in an aesthetically appealing casing.  The <span class="hardware">mainboard</span> 
is mounted vertically, and the shell entraps it, giving it the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower
</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">percolator</span>&#8221;</span> shape referred to.  With the 
streamlined case, the <span class="hardware">power supply</span> is moved outside 
to small transformer.  The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; unit gives 
off so little heat that there are no onboard cooling fans, making the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; a <span class="emphasis"><em>dead-silent</em></span> 
machine.  Imagine the difference in noise when replacing a lab of 
traditional desktops with the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;!  
This case design earned <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; a<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
1998 Industrial Design Excellence Award</span>&#8221;</span> from the Industrial 
Designers Society of America.  This award announcement is still available

The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; had an initial base price of $599US, 
$100US cheaper than <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;'s rollout price.  
Due to it being the only model formally sold by Sun to the general public, 
this is how <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; is sometimes referred to as 
the only <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;, and not one model of a 
product line.

[Sun Option No. JE-xx]
</h4></div></div></div><p>
This model is extremely rare to find.  It was never available for
sale in quantities to either the general public or the initial 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; deployments, limiting the
model's production quantity.  To call this <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Generation 
Three</span>&#8221;</span> of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
may be improper, as <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; is nothing like 
the generation three <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; written about 
in early Sun marketing literature. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; was designed as an extension of 
the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;.   It was geared to sites that 
wanted a little bit more functionality and expansion capability from 
their <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;: a cross between an 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> and a workstation.
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; is powered by the same 
<span class="hardware">110Mhz MicroSPARC IIep chip</span> as <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482;.  It's mainboard is similar to <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;,
with the addition of <span class="hardware">PCI slots</span> and an <span class="hardware">IDE 
channel</span> for local hard disks.  The <span class="hardware">IDE</span> on 
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; was not enabled in the demo units.
Those who have tried to make it work have concluded the wiring is incorrect,
and it requires a hardware rework to get going.
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; continues with the <span class="hardware">PS2 keyboard
</span> and <span class="hardware">PS2 mouse ports</span> from <span class="productname">
Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;. 
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; uses the same <span class="hardware">168-pin, 
3.3V unbuffered EDO DIMMs</span> as <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;.  
The maximum amount of memory for Espresso is reported to be 96MB. 
As with the <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482;, the number <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xx</span>&#8221;</span> in the Sun option number 
refers to the amount of memory shipped with the unit. 
</p><p>
For video display, the <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; uses the 
<span class="hardware">PCI-based IGS C2000 framebuffer</span>, along with the same 
standard <span class="hardware">VGA port connector</span> as <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;.  The 
on-board audio remains a <span class="hardware">Crystal CS4231 chip</span> like 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;, and the network interface remains a 
<span class="hardware">Sun HappyMeal</span> 10/100 Mbps interface like 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; as well.   
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; came with the <span class="hardware">9-pin serial 
port</span> and <span class="hardware">1/8" audio out</span> and 
<span class="hardware">1/8" audio in</span> jacks of <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;, 
and a new addition of a  <span class="hardware">parallel port</span>, and a second
9-pin serial port.  <span class="productname"> Espresso</span>&#8482; also comes 
with the <span class="hardware">flash memory</span> to load your <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> 
on and bypass the network boot cycle. 
</p><p>
One new addition to the <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; is a 
<span class="hardware">smart card slot</span>. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; comes in a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pizza box</span>&#8221;</span> 
style case like the old <span class="productname">Sun SparcStations</span>&#8482;, only 
a little taller, and not quite as wide. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; was never sold to the public.  There 
was an internal testing period at Sun, but the units never went into 
mass-production.
</p><p>
One <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; user mentioned he now uses 
his unit as both a server and router, with the addition of an 
<span class="hardware">IDE disk</span> and <span class="hardware">3C905 ethernet card</span>, 
demonstrating the expandability of this unit.

Like the <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482;, this unit is also an extremely

The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Dover</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; model
</h4></div></div></div><p>
This is another box which does not exist officially outside of Sun.  
Little was known of it at the first revision of this HOWTO.  Since then,
proud owners have stepped forward.  Basically, the Dover takes the Espresso 
theme and moves it to stock X86 parts.  
</p><p>
Dover comes in a case similar to the Espresso, but there's nothing where
the 'JavaStation-E' tag would be.  Dover can be situated in a vertical
position by removable feet.  All that is printed on the case is "Sun
MicroSystems 1998", and typically a serial number sticker of '12345678'
and 'Made in Taiwan'.
</p><p>
The motherboard is 'baby ATX' in configuration, but not
quite totally.  Near the front of the case is a fan that points
at the CPU heat sink.  The CPU heat sink has another fan on top of it. 
The motherboard has a Socket 7 CPU socket that houses a Cyrix MediaGCm-266GP
CPU.  There are typical PC motherboard jumpers with silk-screened legends 
for setting both clock speed and multiplier.  The motherboard accepts
a PC100 DIMM (max. size unknown) and a powersupply with AT-type power
connectors.  Included among them are two floppy and regular hard
drive type plug.  There are two small jumpers going to the motherboard,
JPSB1 and JAUTO1, possibly for power management.
</p><p>
Expansion in Dover is via a two-card riser, with one PCI and one shared
PCI/ISA slot.  As mentioned earlier, the motherboard deviates slightly from
standard ATX. Along the back edge under the cards are
connectors for audio out, audio in, mic, HD15F video, two USB ports, 
D25F parallel printer, stacked PS/2 keyboard/mouse ports, and four
9-pin serial ports, marked A through D.  Unlike other JavaStation models,
there is no on-board ethernet.  Instead, it typically is provided by a 
supplied 3COM 3C905B-TX Fast Etherlink XL PCI card (with a wake-on-LAN 
cable going to the motherboard).  There is a standard Sun MAC address 
label on the back of the case.
</p><p>
Video is via a Cyrix CX5530 chip, but with the MediaGX chip, may be
just an auxilliary chip.  There exist both a FDD and HDD headers on the
motherboard, but nowhere to mount a FDD in the case and no provision
for an HDD bracket either.  There is a simple piezo buzzer mounted to 
the motherboard and additionally a speaker with a cable leading back 
near the audio out jacks.  Like the Espresso, there is a smart-card 
reader as well, and what looks like a compact-flash socket inside.
</p><p>
When booting it up, you get a blue JS screen.  Under the
exclamation point, are two memory card icons and a &lt;...&gt; 
icon.  It reads:
</p><pre class="screen">
Boot device: /ethernet   Arguments:

ok                         
</pre><p>  
The Dover model, since it is based on an x86 chip, is supported by Linux.
This HOWTO however focuses on the SPARC-based JavaStations, so the procedures
presented here <span class="emphasis"><em>will not work</em></span> with it.  However, 
there's plenty of x86 documentation at large to work from.

The Generation 3 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Super JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>
</h4></div></div></div><p>
Sun originally envisioned three generation models of the <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482;: <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;, the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;, and the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Super JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>.   
Generation Three was billed in early literature as going to be the fastest 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; offered, with a high-speed 
<span class="hardware">CPU</span> and a <span class="hardware">JavaChip co-processor</span> 
to translate <span class="application">Java-bytecode</span> in hardware.
</p><p>
All indications are that it never got beyond the mental stage,
and was more of a marketing myth than anything else. 
</p><p>
First, consider that the cost of higher performance <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym> 
as a factor.  If Sun packaged a high-performance <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym> into 
a <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;, the low-cost advantage of an 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> goes away.
</p><p>
Next, Sun did have their <span class="hardware">PicoJava chip</span> available to 
decode <span class="application">Java bytecode</span>, but rumor is the performance 
was not as good as expected, and the complete <span class="hardware">JavaChip</span> 
project was shelved in the Summer of 1998, not long after <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482; was formally released. 

</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Dover</span>&#8221;</span> project was being worked on, but the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Corona
</span>&#8221;</span> project, which would go on to become the <span class="productname">Sun Ray
</span>&#8482;, was the final nail in the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
's coffin.
</p><p>
So all indications are that this model is a piece of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vaporware</span>&#8221;</span>.  
It is included here though, for the sake of completeness.

The Pre-Mr. Coffee JavaStation Prototype
</h4></div></div></div><p>
After the original publishing of this HOWTO, word of one more 
"JavaStation" model surfaced.  John Bodo, a reseller 
of JavaStation equipment, chimed in that he has a motherboard of a 
pre-JavaStation machine.  It was made by Diba Corporation, which was 
later bought out by Sun.  The unit was released as an early embededded 
Java platform that developers could use to build embedded Java machines. 
It has a Motorola 68030 CPU, 14.4k bps modem, ethernet interface, 
standard VGA interface and even a TV output.  The prototype's date is
circa 1996.

The Pre-Mr. Coffee JavaStation/Fox
</h4></div></div></div><p>
After receiving word of the JavaStation prototype from Diba, yet
more information has come regarding another pre-Mr. Coffee model.
This one though, has a greater known history we can share here.
</p><p>
This model was the JavaStation development box used by the developers
of early JavaStation software.  Basically it was a SS4/110 in a smaller,
custom case similar to the Mr. Coffee enclosure, with more squarish profile.  
</p><p>
The case has an off-white color with lateral stripe in Sun gray.  It
sits like a Mr. Coffee would on its side.  The front was a 1/2 cyclinder i
design in Sun  gray, has the Sun Logo, the word "Sun" under that, and the 
Java cup logo at the bottom.  
</p><p>
When booting up it claims to be a "JavaStation/Fox".  The motherboard 
does not have a normal Sun part number.  The CPU is a microSPARC-II running
at 110MHz.  The box has an onboard external SCSI connector,
dual A and B serial ports, audio in and out sound ports (Crystal 
Semiconductor 4231, 
lance ethernet network interface, onboard PCMCIA (stp4020), one SBUS expansion
slot, one AFXbus expansion slot, 2 72-pin SIMM slots (double-banked SIMMs
only), and no on-board video.  One would then add their own S-Bus frame 
buffer, or the 24-bit frame buffer from a ss5.  Also, an optional internal 
SCSI laptop hard drive could be put in.
</p><p>
The motherboard's part number is 501-2785.  The CPU is dated 1995 while the
NCR chips are dated 1994, establishing the time frame of the Fox.
</p><p>
The NetBSD/SPARC FAQ has a few more words on the Fox at:

</acronym> Myths Dispelled</h3></div></div></div><p>
It turns out that <span class="application">Linux</span> makes the 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; perform more than adequately
on the desktop.  Thanks to the dedicated work of the Linux 
developer community, the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;
offer users the low-cost, zero-admin, versatile desktop 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s they were originally billed to be, but with 
the added freedom granted by the <span class="application">Linux OS</span>.
</p><p>
While low-cost <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s now eclipse the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; in terms of default CPU speed and RAM size, the 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; running <span class="application">Linux</span> are still well-suited for a number of tasks:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Diskless X-Terminal.  (Gives the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; the 
capability of the <span class="productname">Sun Xterminal 1</span>&#8482; hardware that 
they replaced).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> solution, Linux-style: local X + a java-capable 
browser can make the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;
perform like they did with <span class="application">JavaOS</span>/<span class="application">
HotJava</span>, only <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> times faster.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
A beowulf node, or a dedicated <span class="application">RC5</span>/<span class="application">
SETI@HOME</span> client. The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
running <span class="application">Linux</span> makes a stable, long-lasting 
number cruncher.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
A small, standalone machine.  While a task more suited on today's 
low-cost machines, there's not much that prevents the <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482; from performing as a full-fleged 
standalone <span class="application">UNIX</span> machine by itself.  
Just remember to set your expectations appropriately when doing so;
they were <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">low-budget</span>&#8221;</span> clients when they were sold, and
should not be directly compared to today's workstation offerings.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
A small router and server, particularly with the <span class="productname">Espresso
</span>&#8482; model decked out with added IDE disks and NIC.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In all of the above scenarios, there is little to no maintenance of
the machine once configured properly.  Such is the advantage of the
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> hardware.  
</p><p>
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; run so much better with 
<span class="application">Linux</span> than <span class="application">JavaOS</span>, 
one would think that even Sun should have offered it as an option.   
Unfortunately, Sun had killed the line in favor of the <span class="productname">Sun Ray
</span>&#8482;.  While the performance of the <span class="productname">Sun Ray
</span>&#8482; is good, keep in mind it is not intended as a dedicated 
computing device, and due to its firmware is little more than a graphics 
display hanging off your Sun server, which can give you some unexpected 
bonus features (translation: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">brand-name product lock</span>&#8221;</span>).  
The performance on 
the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; with <span class="application">Linux
</span> will be similar to what you can get with a <span class="productname">Sun 
Ray</span>&#8482;, but if ever you want to do something different with 
your machines, you have the flexibility to do so with the 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;.  There was rumor of work to try 
and override the default behavior of the SunRay firmware, and make
it into an adjustable computing device, but until that happens, running 
another OS on a SunRay is just a pipe-dream.
</p><p>
Lastly, if you're thinking of switching to <span class="hardware">diskless Xterminals
</span> on your network, you might consider the <span class="productname">JavaStations 
</span>&#8482; over stripped down <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s.  The hardware 
is standardized, smaller, and you do not need to worry about burning boot 
<acronym class="acronym">PROM</acronym>s and the like.

Sun's official stance is that the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
line was terminated in favor of the new <span class="productname">Sun Ray</span>&#8482; 
line.  A trip to the former <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;

)
</p><p>
As the <span class="productname">Sun Ray</span>&#8482; is not an <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> 
in the traditional sense (it has a MicroSparc IIep CPU, but the firmware
on the device prevents anyone from grasping it), there is no explanation why 
the two products could not co-exist.
</p><p>
In talking to the users of the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;
in the pre-Linux era, you will find strong opinions as to why 
the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; are no more.  The common 
thread in almost all opinions collected is that the software provided 
by Sun was inadequete for a production environment.  Here are 
collected opinions from users of the Sun-provided software, included 
with their permission:

I only used the Java Stations last summer while teaching 51 and 55/154.  
GoJoe was incredibly slow and I seem to remember having to login to several 
different screens and browsers just to be able to start anything.
</p><p>
I had to apologize to my students for the slow and inconvenient 
machines --- I remember making some jokes about technological progress.

Well, of course the old JavaStations were practically
unusable.  It's not a matter of just my opinion; we used to
have CU 310 full of students using the Xterms all the time.
As soon as the JavaStations appeared there were NO STUDENTS
in there at all.  The JavaStations killed CU 310.  Now that
the JavaStations are (thanks to you) back up to speed,
students are beginning to come back, but they've gotten out
of the habit of working in our lab, and are used to working
on their own in the dorms.  I think this is a big loss --
they don't learn anything from talking to each other in the
labs anymore.
</p><p>
Ghostview was slow, etc, but even vi was too slow.  I am
used to typing quickly, and when the cursor can't keep up
with me, I can't handle it.  I would also have worked at home
if I didn't have to be here.  And there were those annoying
red squares left all over the Xterm window when you were in
vi.  I had to type ^L every few lines to get rid of them to
see what I was typing...  The pits.  The whole setup made
me lose a lot of respect for Sun (although I try to separate
the different product lines as much as possible);  I also
think Sun will not get respect for hyping a product like the
JavaStation so strongly, and then just dumping it.  I would
wonder why anyone would not just dump Sun...
</p><p>
BTW, the JavaStations, now that they are fast, are quite fine.
I really like mine, and don't see why they aren't a viable
product.

I believe that it was the triple combination of Sun's JavaOS, the 
Hotjava software, and GraphOn's GoJoe X-connectivity software which 
ultimately doomed the JavaStation line. 
</p><p>
JavaOS was always sluggish in performance for us.  It was rated as
having one of the slowest Java VMs by a ZDNet Online Magazane review at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/jfgr10.htm" target="_top">
http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/hfgr10.htm</a>
.  I speculate this was the main cause of delaying the 
JavaStation's formal public release to April 1998.   
</p><p>
(fair use archive copy of the PC mag review at:
<a class="ulink" href="http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/texts/pcmag_js_jvm_review.txt" target="_top">
http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/texts/pcmag_js_jvm_review.txt
</a>
)
</p><p>
JavaOS also always lagged behind the current Java developer 
spec (ie running Java 1.0 when Java 1.1 was prevalent, and Java 1.1 
when Java 1.2 was issued).  It was tough explaining to students why
the books they were buying were all using the new event-model of Java 1.1,
but they could not program to it and have it run on <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">the Java machine
</span>&#8221;</span>.  There were also some implementation problems with some of the 
AWT peers which sometimes made programming across platforms difficult.
</p><p>
These performance and implementation problems were never addressed in 
subsequent build of JavaOS for the duration we ran it.  I believe the 
last edition we had used a Java 1.1.4 runtime, when we had a Java 1.2
development kit on the server.
</p><p>
The HotJava browser software suffered from not being able to handle 
web standards HTML4, cascading style-sheets, or the ECMA javascript.
All of these standards were employed in commercial sites at the time, 
resulting in many sites that weren't viewable by the JavaStations.  
The Hotjava Browser engine also had serious printing problems with 
certain webpages, some of which appeared on Sun's own website!
</p><p>
The HotJava Views task selector software also was rough.  Users could have
multiple apps running, but only one displayed at a time.  Manipulation 
of multiple window panes was difficult (no minimization, no quick list to
all apps, resizing not always possible).  Flexibility users had grown
accustomed to was tossed out in favor of this task-selector approach.
On Sun's Java website there was a page boasting of a committee formed
that decided this was the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">right way</span>&#8221;</span> to make a desktop.
Tell that to our users.
</p><p>
The GraphOn Go-Joe software was by far the most damaging piece of software
to the JavaStation line.  This was an X-connectivity software Sun licensed
from GraphOn to give users access to the Solaris servers' X apps.  
The connectivity worked via a daemon installed on the Solaris server, 
which was connected to by a Java connectivity applet on the NC side.  This 
small applet (only about 250K) simply threw up the latest display state 
and sent back to the daemon the mouse and keyboard strokes of the user.  
Unlike Xterminals though, the actual Xserver process was spawned and 
communicated with on the remote server-side by the daemon.  Communication 
between the GraphOn client applet and the server daemon was supposedly 
done by a patented protocol to compress communication and speed things up.
However, the performance of X under Go-Joe was terribly sluggish, with 
horrible refresh rates (10-seconds for some page scroll refreshes).  
Many sites operators I spoke to elected to not run the Go-Joe software 
past a trial period for this reason.  We had to run it though, as our 
users were heavily X dependant.  Alternatives like Weird/X were not 
available at this time, and VNC proved not up to snuff given the slow 
JavaOS VM.
</p><p>
This performance in Go-Joe alone was enough to give uninformed users the
impression that the JavaStation was an underpowered machine, especially 
when placed side-by-side with the low-cost, end-of-lifed Sun Xterminal 1 
hardware it was meant to replace.  Our students left labs in droves, 
faculty were upset, and giving demos to outsiders was downright 
embarrassing.  In reality the hardware was solid and stable, but 
was hampered by this new, untested OS and new, untested applications 
running on a new, untested hardware architecture.   This triple-threat 
combination, and Sun's timeline for fixing the problems is what 
I feel truly doomed the JavaStation.
</p><p>
I remember that in 1998, Sun publicized that it had rolled out 3000 
of these machines in-house, including one on Scott McNealy's desk.  
One who has used the JavaStations with the Sun software would have 
to wonder whether he ever turned it on and used it solely for a day?  
Had he done so, I'm sure he'd demand things be done differently.  
(update Oct. 2001:  many ex-Sun employees who've contacted me say they
made great doorstops and paper weights.)
</p><p>
Why Sun never ported and released its tried and tested XTerminal 
software to the JavaStation, or even a mini-Solaris, remained a 
mystery to us the whole time before we switched to Linux.  It was
only after we moved to Linux and the JavaStation line was formally killed
by Sun when we learned from some inside Sun sources that Solaris 
actually was ported to Mr. Coffee, but released only internally at Sun.  
As a heavily invested customer site who had begged for help, this was 
not only disheartening, but insulting to discover.
</p><p>
Lastly, the customer support we received at the time was horrible.  We pled
our case on more than a few occassions, but requests always seemed to
fall on deaf ears.  Calling up SunSolve for JavaStation help always
resulted in a transfer to a Java <span class="emphasis"><em>Language</em></span> engineer.  
If the Sun employees do not know their own products, that's a problem!
</p><p>
&gt;From our view, there no doubt was politics involved in this, and as
customers, we were the ones to bear the results of this.
We continue using Sun equipment when it comes to the proven models 
like the Enterprise-class servers and disk arrays, but on the 
latest low-cost desktop offerings, we will be forever cautious 
given the JavaStation history.
</p><p>
Linux now proves the JavaStations are adequate machines, and Sun could 
take this bait and go with it.  If they sell the JavaStations for $250 
a piece and the JavaStation running a proven OS like Linux (or Solaris) 
with proven apps (X), the JavaStation makes for a great network appliance.  
The recent NetPliance I-Opener Linux hack and subsequent controversy 
proves there certainly is a market for this type of low-cost device.
(Oct. 2001 addition: After the publishing of the Linux hack, NetPliance made 
their new hardware unhackable, and subsequently ran out of business.  The
demand for cheap diskless stations still exist.   Today's hackable units
are set-top receivers and failed internet toasters like the 3Com Audrey)

More comments and rebuttal statements by Sun employees are always welcome.

(update Oct 2001): A year and a half of this document's existance and not
a single rebuttal statement by Sun.  There were a couple initial requests 
to omit this section, but I refused.  After all, imagine a new reader 
who never saw a JavaStation before: They'd read to this section, think
"Wow, what a great little machine..let me get one!", and then ask
themselves, "If it did all this, why don't they make them anymore?".
The bad must be included with the good, and to leave this section out

therefore, is a necessity, and although this document is licensed under the

Since Sun has canceled production of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
line, it no longer sells them through their official channels.  Sun
contacts have informed me that all internal JavaStation stock
was cleaned out and dumped in 2000.  Therefore, All JavaStations are 
now found out in the wild.
</p><p>
Your best bet to get <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; though is 
out on the open market.  Educational institutions which received a 
handful from Sun as demo units are now trying to offload them any way 
they can (too bad they don't read this HOWTO).  Search around the 
auction sites like Ebay and Yahoo Auctions, and you should be able 
to turn some up.

Ebay may now be your best bet.
</p><p>
Mr. Coffee is the most widespread JavaStation model, and has tended
to sell around $30-80US consistently for the last year or so.  
</p><p>
Krups models more rare and sell at higher prices, probably because the 
stylish case still stands out today.  Prices on Ebay are always over
$100, but for Oct. 2001, their technology is definitely no longer worth 
that much.  A good price would be $80-85US.   Many reports have come from 
the UK telling of many Krups models getting dumped there.  
</p><p>
The Dover models were a very hush-hush thing when this HOWTO was initially
published, but the secret is out: if you want one, go to South Africa.  
Dovers seemed to have been dumped there en masse.  Pricing is unknown,
but should be comparable to a Cyrix-266 PC clone.
</p><p>
The Espresso and JavaEngine models are near impossible to find,
so if you get one, consider yourself lucky.  If you have a Fox,
well, you're just too cool.  Pricing for these models is likely a
premium. (&gt;$100US).

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="HardwareRequirementsSection"></a>3.1. Complete Hardware Requirements</h3></div></div></div><p>
For hardware, you will need one or more <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
clients and a server to feed it its <span class="application">Linux</span> 
image from, all networked on the same net segment. 
</p><p>
This server you use can be any server which supports <acronym class="acronym">DHCP</acronym> 
and <acronym class="acronym">TFTP</acronym>, and <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym>.  These are the 
base protocols needed to perform a network boot of the <span class="productname">
JavaStations</span>&#8482;.  You may also need <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym>
service as well, but it is not necessary in one type of configuration 
this HOWTO describes.  Also, you can get by without <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> 
on both the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Espresso
</span>&#8482; models. 
</p><p>
This document will describe how to set up serving the network <span class="application">
Linux OS</span> image to the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
from a Sun server running <span class="application">SparcLinux</span>.  While you 
do not need a Sun server to serve your <span class="application">Linux</span> 
image off of, a <span class="hardware">Sun SparcLinux server</span> is recommended
should you wish to compile a kernel of your own, or prototype a new 
filesystem for your <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; to use.  
Otherwise, you will need to use prepackaged kernels and filesystems 
somebody else has pre-built and made publicly available for use. 
(You might also use a cross-compiler to produce the kernel images,
but prototyping a filesystem is best done on a Sun SparcLinux server.)
</p><p>
Reports of successful boot servers used include Sun boxes running 
Sparclinux, Sun boxes running Solaris, and PCs running MS Windows.  
It is only when you are building a new kernel or filesystem that a 
Sun box running Linux becomes valuable.
</p><p>
Your network can be a simple <span class="hardware">10 Mbps ethernet</span> 
<acronym class="acronym">LAN</acronym>, but when you begin using more than 50 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; at once, a <span class="hardware">switched 
100 Mbps network</span> becomes desirable for your server to handle 
multiple concurrent boot requests. 
</p><p>
This HOWTO includes pointers to example kernels, filesystems and a 
complete out-of-the-box solution for you to use, eliminating your need for 
a <span class="hardware">Linux/SPARC server</span>, but you still need a server of 
some type to feed the image to the <span class="hardware">JavaStations</span> as 
they boot.

When powered on, the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; sends out a 
broadcast request for its <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym>.  It gets its <acronym class="acronym">IP
</acronym> info via <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> or <acronym class="acronym">DHCP</acronym>.  
With a <acronym class="acronym">DHCP</acronym> response, it gets information about the 
network it is on and where to go download its boot image from via 
<acronym class="acronym">TFTP</acronym>. 
</p><p>
There are subtle variations in diskless boots from one diskless machine to 
the next.  For instance, <acronym class="acronym">BOOTP</acronym> may sometimes be 
substituted where <acronym class="acronym">DHCP</acronym> is, and <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> 
may be eliminated in favor of either of the two.   But in general, the 
sequence is typically the same between the client and the server:

   S: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Here's your image.</span>&#8221;</span>
   </p></li></ol></div><p>
After the kernel is finished loading, your diskless client typically mounts 
its root filesystem from the network via <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym>.  
Alternatively, it may load and mount it from a <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk.
</p><p>
The original JavaOS and Hotjava Views environment, when run on a JavaStation, 
required the setup and maintenance of the core services above, plus
also NIS, HTTP, DNS, POP, and NTP servers.  If setting up a JavaStation boot
server seems like a lot of work, imagine adding these extra services
into the mix too.

(<span class="application">PROLL</span>)</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; came with two different 
<acronym class="acronym">PROMs</acronym> installed in them.  Version 2.30 shipped with 
the earliest <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482; models, and was 
updated by latter versions of the <span class="application">Sun Netra J</span> 
software environment to 3.11.  <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; and 
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; came with 3.x versions of the 
<acronym class="acronym">PROM</acronym> by default. 
</p><p>
It turns out the later 3.x series of <acronym class="acronym">PROMs</acronym> is not 
conducive to booting <span class="application">Linux</span> upon.  
Fortunately, a complete <acronym class="acronym">PROM</acronym> replacement 
called <span class="application">PROLL</span> now exists to get by this limitation.
</p><p>
<span class="application">PROLL</span> becomes the first image your <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482; grabs by <acronym class="acronym">TFTP</acronym>.  It then
will load your true kernel image and boot into <span class="application">Linux
</span>.   
</p><p>
No matter what <acronym class="acronym">PROM</acronym> revision you have, get <span class="application">
PROLL</span>.  This can make troubleshooting new installs easier. 
</p><p>
The current, master version of <span class="application">PROLL</span> is available 
from: 
<a class="ulink" href="http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/" target="_top">
            http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/</a>. 
</p><p>
The current version at the time of this writing is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">14</span>&#8221;</span>. 
</p><p>
<span class="application">PROLL</span> can also be found mirrored on <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">VGER

Embedded?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Before you begin, you must decide upon the root-filesystem type you wish to 
use for your diskless <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;.   There are
two possibilities.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="NFSRootFSDesc"></a>3.5.1. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym>-Root</span>&#8221;</span> Filesystem</h4></div></div></div><p>
In this setup, after the boot kernel is retrieved off the network, the 
running <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; makes an <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym> 
connection for its root filesystem.  The root directory <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/</span>&#8221;</span> is 
mounted off the network for the duration of the current session. 
</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym>-Root</span>&#8221;</span> solution is the recommended 
way to go for beginners, as it is easier to troubleshoot if there are 
problems.  It also makes it easier to prototype the proper filesystem, 
as any changes you make on a running system can be propogated for the 
next boot cycle (so long as you are in read-write mode, of course). 
</p><p>
Drawbacks of this type of system is increased network activity as the
running JavaStations locate and execute files, plus file organization 
in large environments.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="EmbeddedFSDesc"></a>3.5.2. 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> Filesystem 
</h4></div></div></div><p>
In this setup, the root filesystem is loaded directly into <acronym class="acronym">RAM
</acronym> and accessed from there. 
</p><p>
The advantage of this setup is that there is no <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym> 
traffic to worry about, resulting in a clean solution. 
</p><p>
The disadvantage of this configuration is that you can no longer do rapid 
prototyping of your filesystem, as any changes you make to a running system 
are lost.  If you have no <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> setup available, you 
develop an embedded filesystem by making small tweaks and performing 
reboots to test.   Other disadvantages include the requirement of fitting
the full filesystem in available RAM; due to a limitation of PROLL, this
requirement is much lower on JavaStations than expected.  Still, embedded
root is the way to go for the cleanest environment.
</p><p>
First time users will want to set up an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> 
configuration.   When you have things stabilized, move to 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> to take use of its advantages.

One website to keep on reference when you begin thinking about 
putting Linux on your JavaStation is kernel hacker Pete Zaitcev's 
website at: <a class="ulink" href="http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/" target="_top">
http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/</a>, referenced 
throughout this document as the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">ZLS</span>&#8221;</span> site (short for
"Zaitcev's Linux Site").  Here you will find the latest version of 
PROLL and many low-level details about dealing with the JavaStations.
Many items on the ZLS have been merged into this document, but not all.
</p><p>
Oct. 2001 update: It is in your best interest to review all the information 
on Pete's site, in this document, and references pointed to, before diving 
in and setting up your JavaStation with Linux.  Almost all questions people 
have had in setting up their systems are covered in the materials presented.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="KernelBuildChapter"></a>4. Build Your Kernel</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KernelBuild-BeforeBeginningSection"></a>4.1. Before you begin</h3></div></div></div><p>
This chapter assumes you wish to compile your own <span class="application">Linux
</span> kernel for the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;.  
If this is something you can not do, there are sample kernels pointed
to at the end of this chapter.
</p><p>
This chapter assumes you already know how to compile 
<span class="application">Linux</span> kernels in general, perhaps 
on a <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>, a <acronym class="acronym">SPARC </acronym> server 
running <span class="application">Linux</span>, or any of the 
other <span class="application">Linux</span> ports.  If not, read the 
Kernel-HOWTO and the README file of your kernel source. 
</p><p>
Compiling a kernel for a <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; is not 
much different than compiling a <span class="application">Linux kernel</span> 
elsewhere.  You just need to know the right options to pick.  In general, 
you're compiling for a <span class="hardware">Sun4M class architecture</span>, and 
enabling <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;-specific options.  The 
following sections in this chapter will take you through the steps. 
</p><p>
While it may be possible to compile the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
-enabled kernel on alternate platforms by way of a cross-compiler, this 
HOWTO assumes you will do it on a <span class="hardware">Linux/Sparc based server</span> 
running in 32-bit mode.   Cross-compiling will not be covered, and 
questions regarding it will not be entertained. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KernelBuild-WorkIn32BitModeSection"></a>4.2. Make sure you use 32-bit mode</h3></div></div></div><p>
When compiling your own <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;-capable 
kernel on a Sun server, you need to make sure the machine you work on is 
set to 32-bit mode.  So, if you're on an Ultra-class machine, be sure to
first switch to 32-bit mode before you begin compiling. 
</p><p>
To check what mode you're in, do a <strong class="userinput"><code>uname -a</code></strong>.  If it 
says <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sparc</span>&#8221;</span>, you're in 32-bit mode and don't have to do 
anything.  If it reports <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sparc64</span>&#8221;</span>, then you should perform
a <strong class="userinput"><code>sparc32 bash</code></strong> first to switch to 32-bit mode.  A 
subsequent <strong class="userinput"><code>uname -a</code></strong> should reflect the change. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KernelBuild-KernelVersionSupportSection"></a>4.3. Supported <span class="application">Linux Kernel</span> Versions</h3></div></div></div><p>
The kernel source revision you should use depends both on which model of 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; you have, and which series
kernel you are using.  The current "stable" series of Linux kernels is 
2.4.x, but as we will read in a minute, this may not be the best bet
to use.
</p><p>
First, a few note on the 2.2.x and 2.3.x series.  
<span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482; has had kernel support since about 
kernel version 2.2.5, and definitely works out of the box with the 
<span class="application">RedHat 6.0+/SPARC distribution kernels</span>. 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; support did not work well out of the 
box until the latter 2.3.x kernel cycle.  Krups support was added
in the early 2.3.x sequence, but the <span class="hardware">MMU</span> changes 
to the 32-bit <span class="application"> SPARC kernel</span> had kept it from 
compiling cleanly until later on.  
</p><p>
Kernels for both Mr. Coffee and Krups compiled cleanly by the HOWTO
author with the Mar. 17, 2000 CVS kernel, and are included in the 
Sample Kernels section.<span class="productname">. Krups</span>&#8482; support was
backported into the 2.2.x kernels (where x&gt;15).  The latest 2.2.x 
kernel "should" compile cleanly for the Mr. Coffee and Krups models, 
but your mileage may vary.
</p><p>
Now onto the 2.4.x series.
</p><p>
The only kernel which has been tested and compiles cleanly for Mr. Coffee
and Krups is version 2.4.2.  All other versions are broken or require a
patch.
</p><p>
The reason for this is that the sparc32 branch of the kernel has not had 
an active maintainer for many months.  Some are contributing fixes, but
without an active maintainer things go slow.
</p><p>
There is another reason to be weary of the 2.4.x series.  From 2.4.0 through
2.4.9, the VM of the kernel was found to be inadequate under heavy loads,
and was subsequently replaced in 2.4.10+.  This was a big change for the
so-called "stable" series of kernels.
</p><p>
To add further insult to injury, there have been security flaws detected
in all of 2.2.x kernel series and up through 2.4.12.  This is patched
in pre-2.2.20 and 2.4.12+.  As of this writing, 2.4.12+ has not been checked
by the author as functioning on the JavaStations.
</p><p>
So basically, it has been a crap-shoot over which kernel to choose. 
Try a few until you find one that suits you best.
</p><p>
If you can not get a kernel to compile, or wish to avoid the headache or
trying, you may try the samples pointed to by this document.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KernelBuild-RequiredKernelConfigOptionsSection"></a>4.4. Required Kernel Configuration Options</h3></div></div></div><p>
When you do your <strong class="userinput"><code>make config</code></strong> command to enter the
kernel configuration stage, there are a few things you are required to 
enable.  Note that the following option names are from a 2.2.x kernel, 
and may be slightly different on a 2.4.x series kernel.   If in doubt,
check the sample files later in the chapter.
</p><p>
For all <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;, you want to enable 
<acronym class="acronym">PCI</acronym> support: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_PCI=y 
</pre><p>
Don't forget your mouse: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_BUSMOUSE=y 
CONFIG_SUN_MOUSE=y 
</pre><p>
You'll want video, done with the <span class="application">Linux framebuffer interface</span>: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_FB_TCX=y (for Mr. Coffee) 
CONFIG_FB_PCI=y 
CONFIG_FB_IGA=y (for Krups/Espresso) 
</pre><p>
Audio is done with the <span class="hardware">Crystal Audio 4231 chipset</span>: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_SPARCAUDIO=y 
CONFIG_SPARCAUDIO_CS4231=y 
</pre><p>
Don't forget your network interface: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_SUNLANCE=y (Mr. Coffee) 
CONFIG_HAPPYMEAL=y (Krups/Espresso) 
</pre><p>
You'll no doubt need to support a filesystem: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y 
</pre><p>
You'll want <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> autoconfiguration, and 
<acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">BOOTP</acronym> support: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_IP_PNP=y 
CONFIG_IP_PNP_BOOTP=y 
CONFIG_IP_PNP_RARP=y 
</pre><p>
When doing the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> filesystem configuration, you will 
need both <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym>-Root support: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y 
CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=y 
</pre><p>
When doing the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> filesystem, configure both 
<acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> disks and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">initial ramdisk</span>&#8221;</span> support: 
</p><pre class="screen">
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y   (for 2.4.x, also configure size of ramdisk)
</pre><p>
You can get a working <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.config</span>&#8221;</span> file which has the required
options set later in this chapter. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KernelBuild-EmbeddedRootFSPatchSection"></a>4.5. Necessary Patch for <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> FS Configurations</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you have decided to go with the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> filesystem
option, you will want to make a patch to the <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk 
driver source first. 
</p><p>
The default size of a <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> disk when using the <acronym class="acronym">RAM
</acronym>disk driver is 4 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>.  Chances are that you will 
want an embedded filesystem of more than that size, particularly when you 
start thinking about running an <span class="application">X server</span>, or 
including a <span class="application">Java</span> runtime. 
</p><p>
You can do this for 2.2.x kernels by a manual edit yourself, or by using the 
patch pointed to below.  The change is a one-line edit in the file 
&lt;LINUXROOT&gt;/drivers/block/rd.c .  Look for a line that says: 
</p><pre class="screen">
int rd_size = 4096; /* Size of the RAM disks */ 
</pre><p>
and change it to the size of the <acronym class="acronym">RAMdisk</acronym> you wish.  
Typically, most embedded systems are under 16 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>, so 
a common edit is to change the line to: 
</p><pre class="screen">
int rd_size = 4 * 4096; /* Size of the RAM disks */ 
</pre><p>
If you can not do this, the patch below makes the edit for you.
</p><p>
4MB to 16MB kernel patch file is at:
<a class="ulink" href="http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/patches/ramdisk_patch.txt" target="_top">
     http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/patches/ramdisk_patch.txt
</a>
</p><p>
Kernels in the 2.4.x series allow you to select the amount of RAM
as a configuration option.  The patch is no longer needed for those
kernels.
</p><p>
It should also be noted in this section that there is currently a limit on the
size of <span class="application">Linux</span> boot image for all 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; models, due to the implementation
of <span class="application">PROLL</span>.  This limit is technically 8 
<acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>.  This topic is mentioned again in 
the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Questions and TroubleShooting</span>&#8221;</span> section of this document.

To build the kernel, you type <strong class="userinput"><code>make vmlinux</code></strong>.  If you 
come from an <span class="hardware">x86 </span> Linux background, you might be 
surprised that you do not perform a <strong class="userinput"><code>make bzImage</code></strong>
or <strong class="userinput"><code>make zImage</code></strong>.  Do not be alarmed: this command
is correct.
</p><p>
When the compile is finished, you will find a file named <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vmlinux
</span>&#8221;</span> in the kernel source root directory.  You are almost ready to
put this kernel to use.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="KernelBuild-elftoaout"></a>4.7. Convert Kernel from ELF to a.out format</h3></div></div></div><p>
You need to make one more change to your kernel before it is ready for
use.  You need to convert it from <acronym class="acronym">ELF</acronym> to <acronym class="acronym">AOUT
</acronym> executable format.  You can do this with the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">elftoaout
</span>&#8221;</span> utility included in most <span class="application">Linux/SPARC</span> 
distributions. 
</p><p>
To convert your kernel image to the <acronym class="acronym">AOUT</acronym> executable format, 
you issue the command: 
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>elftoaout -o vmlinux.aout vmlinux </code></strong>
</pre><p>
You will probably now want to rename the image file to a longer name 
which includes the current date and kernel revision you used, so as not 
to get confused with when you have multiple boot kernel images down the road.
</p><p>
The elftoaout program should come with your SparcLinux distribution.
If not, try VGER or your favorite kernel mirror.

Description:
</p><p>
This kernel is donated by Robert Dubinski.  It was used at Marquette 
University to build an embedded root boot image.  This is based off of the
Mar. 17, 2000 CVS kernel.  It includes support for both Mr. Coffee and

This chapter describes how one constructs a filesystem suitable for use
on the <span class="application">Linux</span>-running <span class="productname">JavaStations
</span>&#8482;.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="FileSystemBuild-FSBuildIntroSection"></a>5.1. Preparing Yourself to Build Your Own Filesystem</h3></div></div></div><p>
Building a filesystem for use with the <span class="productname">JavaStations
</span>&#8482; is a time-consuming, but rewarding task for those 
who undertake it.  You will learn more about library dependencies than 
you ever thought you could, all the time while trying to keep the
overall image size as small as possible. 
</p><p>
WARNING: This is not an easy task.    Creating a lasting filesystem is
not for novices.   If you seriously consider undertaking this step,
prepare to budget a bit of time to get things just right, particularly
if you plan to make an embedded-root filesystem which fits in the
8MB limit.  You have now been properly warned.
</p><p>
There are two common approaches one can take when rolling a new
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;-ready filesystem.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
Start with an established distribution's filesystem and whittle down 
to the core.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Start with an established distribution's <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">rescue disk</span>&#8221;</span>
filesystem and add desired functionality. 
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Which path you take, of course, is entirely up to you.  The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">rescue 
disk</span>&#8221;</span> build procedure seems to work best though, as more base 
commands in a rescue disk are statically linked, increasing the starting
image size but causing less initial library headaches.  Commands included
on a rescue disk also happen to be bare-bones, with many extraneous options 
not compiled in.
</p><p>
Obviously when building a filesystem in the context of the <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482;, you will be basing off of an existing 
<span class="application">Linux/SPARC</span> filesystem.  The filesystems
that come with the RedHat, SuSE or Debian distributions are good 
starting points.
</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
In the future, you will also need to make sure you base off a filesystem 
built with compiled 32-bit mode executables, as a 64-bit userland project 
is presently in progress for 64-bit <acronym class="acronym">SPARC</acronym> 
<span class="application">Linux kernels</span>.  As of Oct. 2001, this is
still a ways away, but it is being mentioned now for the future.

Prepping up the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> boot image requires a 
number of extra steps.  Due to these extra steps, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> 
filesystem option is recommended for beginners to <span class="application">Linux
</span> on the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;.  You might 
also try the samples pointed to in this document.  Should you still wish 
to build and embedded image on your own, this section outlines the basic 
instructions. 
</p><p>
Creating the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> boot image is a 5-Step Procedure: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Prototype Your Filesystem</em></span> 
</p><p>
This whole chapter deals with rolling your own filesystem.  
In this step, it is assumed you create your own filesystem,
perhaps by prototyping one on a working <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span>
filesystem configuration. 
</p><p>
One thing to keep in mind is that unlike your <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span>
filesystem, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> filesystem must fit 
within the confines of your allocated <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk, 
generally 4-16 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>.  Your maximum size is dependant
on the setting of the <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk driver. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Create an Empty File for Your FileSystem</em></span> 
</p><p>
You now need to create a file-based filesystem <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">container</span>&#8221;</span>.
This is just a file that is the size of your <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk. 
</p><p>
To create this, try the <strong class="userinput"><code>dd</code></strong> command: 
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=./fs_test.img bs=1k count=8000 </code></strong>
</pre><p>
Using this example, you now should have an 8 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym> file 
named <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fs_test.img</span>&#8221;</span>.  Note: Be <span class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> 
the count you use matches the <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk size you 
allocated for in the kernel's <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk driver! 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Format your Filesystem <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Container</span>&#8221;</span></em></span> 
</p><p>
Now that you have a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">container</span>&#8221;</span> for your filesystem, it
is time to format it and place a bare filesystem on it. 
</p><p>
In our kernel phase, we added in support for the ext2 filesystem.
We'll now format our <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">container</span>&#8221;</span> with this filesystem
type.
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>mkfs.ext2 ./fs_test.img</code></strong>
</pre><p>
Ignore any warnings about the file not being a block device, and
proceed anyway.   This is an expected warning message.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mount the Filesystem <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Container</span>&#8221;</span> and Write to It</em></span> 
</p><p>
Now that you have your filesystem container, you can 
mount it and load your prototyped filesystem on it. 
</p><p>
To mount the container, use the kernel loopback device.  
Make sure your server's kernel has loopback support enabled 
and issue a:  
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>mount -o loop ./fs_test.img /mnt</code></strong>
</pre><p>
Copy your files to the filesystem, and make sure <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/etc/fstab
</span>&#8221;</span> has the <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>disk entries as described 
elsewhere in this document.
</p><p>
To avoid symbolic links being changed into actual copies of files, use
a copy tool like <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tar</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cpio</span>&#8221;</span> instead of a 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cp</span>&#8221;</span>. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Unmount and Compress the Root Filesystem</em></span> 
</p><p>
Unmount the root filesystem you just created. 
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>umount /mnt</code></strong>
</pre><p>
Compress the filesystem file with maximum <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">gzip</span>&#8221;</span> 
compression levels. 
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>gzip -v9 ./fs_test.img</code></strong>
</pre><p>
You should now have <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fs_test.img.gz</span>&#8221;</span> file.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Hook the Root-Filesystem Onto the Back of Your Kernel Image</em></span>
</p><p>
Now you must append the filesystem image onto your kernel. 
</p><p>
You do this with a utility program called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">piggyback</span>&#8221;</span>.  
The piggyback program takes care of the task of appending the two and 
letting the kernel know where both it and the filesystem begins and ends. 
</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">piggyback</span>&#8221;</span> program is found in your kernel source tree 
under &lt;LINUXROOT&gt;/arch/sparc/boot.  It might also be found on your
favorite ftp.kernel.org site. 
</p><p>
For piggyback to work, it needs your <acronym class="acronym">AOUT</acronym> format 
kernel image, the System.map file from your kernel source root 
directory, and the compressed root-filesystem you just created. 
</p><p>
We put it all together with a: 
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>piggyback vmlinux.aout System.map fs_test.img.gz</code></strong>
</pre><p>
Be sure to backup your kernel image first, as piggyback used the same 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vmlinux.aout</span>&#8221;</span> filename for output.  Check the filesize of 
your <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vmlinux.aout</span>&#8221;</span> file after giving this command and you 
can verify the filesystem has indeed been appended. 
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Congratulations!  You've created an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span>

This chapter describes the configuration steps necessary for 
the server machine to hand-off your <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
boot image.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ServerSetup-ServerPrefaceSection"></a>7.1. Preface</h3></div></div></div><p>
It is now time to setup your server to deliver the <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> 
and filesystem to the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;. 
</p><p>
In our examples here, we configure a Linux/SPARC server <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">lnxserv
</span>&#8221;</span> at private IP 192.168.128.100 to deliver a boot image to 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">java01</span>&#8221;</span> at 
private IP 192.168.128.1. Both are on private network 192.168.128/24.  
When using an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> Filesystem, the location on 
the server of the filesystem in our sample is at <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/path/to/nfsroot
</span>&#8221;</span>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ServerSetup-ConfigureRARPSection"></a>7.2. Setting up the <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> service</h3></div></div></div><p>
We first need to set up <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> service on our server, 
so the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; can auto-configure its 
<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym>. 
</p><p>
First, populate the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/etc/ethers</span>&#8221;</span> file with the mapping of 
the mac address of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; to its 
hostname: 
</p><pre class="screen">
### /etc/ethers 
8:0:20:82:7a:21  lnxserv  # 192.168.128.100 (server is not necessary,)
#                         #                 (just for completeness)
#
#
08:00:20:81:C2:ae java01   # 192.168.128.1 (JavaStation)
#
###
</pre><p>
Next, populate the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/etc/hosts</span>&#8221;</span> file with the <acronym class="acronym">IP
</acronym> to hostname maps: 
</p><pre class="screen">
### /etc/hosts 
192.168.128.100 lnxserv
192.168.128.1 java01
###
</pre><p>
Lastly, configure the <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> cache to fill.
On 2.2.x based systems, you do this with the /sbin/rarp command, so
fill the cache at startup:
</p><pre class="screen">
### Part of rc.local
#
# If necessary, first load the rarp module to be able to fill the cache.
# /sbin/insmod rarp
#
# Now we fill the rarp cache.  You better have the rarp command available.
if [ -f /sbin/rarp ]; then
        /sbin/rarp -f
fi
###
</pre><p>
On 2.4.x based systems, you must use the userland RARP daemon to answer
RARP requests instead.

You now need to configure your server to deliver <acronym class="acronym">DHCP</acronym>

the network it is on, and where to get its boot image from.

Only)</h3></div></div></div><p>
When you are serving up an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> filesystem, you need 
to share the filesystem you created to the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; client.  You do this with the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/etc/exports</span>&#8221;</span>

</p><pre class="screen">

Now we need to set up the last step on our server: the <acronym class="acronym">TFTP
</acronym> configuration.  For this step, you will need the kernel 
you created (using the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> option) or the 
piggybacked kernel/fs boot image (using the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> 
option), the appropriate <span class="application">PROLL</span>, and some 
knowledge of hexadecimal numbering. 
</p><p>
The first thing you need to do is verify that <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">TFTPd</span>&#8221;</span> is 
enabled in your <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/etc/inetd.conf</span>&#8221;</span> file: 
</p><pre class="screen">
tftp	dgram	udp	wait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.tftpd
</pre><p>
Now, you move your copy of proll for your <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; architecture, along your kernel or piggybacked kernel 
image to /tftpboot. 
</p><p>
Now, you create of symbolic link from the hexidecimal version of your 
<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> to your <span class="application">PROLL</span> image, 
and a map from <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">HEXIP.PROL</span>&#8221;</span> to your real kernel image.  If 
you are using <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> option, you point to your 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> Filesystem plus Kernel image.  If you are 
using the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">NFS-Root</span>&#8221;</span> option, you need to point to the 
normal <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vmlinux.aout</span>&#8221;</span> image, plus have a separate map of 
<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym>-&gt;nfsroot location.  For sake of completeness, 
you might also want a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">HEXIP.SUN4M</span>&#8221;</span> -&gt; <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">HEXIP
</span>&#8221;</span> map, as that is the custom way of dealing with net boot 
situations with the Sun.

Once you've selected or built your boot files to use, and configured your 
boot server to serve them, it is time to boot your JavaStation with Linux!
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="JavaStationBoot-BootVisualsSection"></a>8.1. What to See When Booting Linux</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are multiple stages to the JavaStation boot cycle.  What
you see on screen can give you clues as to whether things are going
well or not. Therefore, it is vital you become familiar with 
these boot stages, so you can troubleshoot problems rapidly.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="JavaStationBoot-FreshBoot"></a>8.1.1. Stage 1: White Screen</h4></div></div></div><p>
When you first boot, your JavaStation will start up with
a white background screen and black-text PROM banner on top.
You will also see a black "exclamation mark in triangle" warning
logo. This means the system doesn't yet know who it is, and begins
sending RARP/BOOTP requests.
</p><p>
If you do not get this white screen, there is something wrong with your
JavaStation. Check all connections, particularly your keyboard, monitor
and mouse cords.  If the JavaStation does not detect a keyboard or mouse,
it thinks it is being booted into a serial console, and will not use the
monitor (or keyboard/mouse).   In exceptional cases, you may need to reset 
a jumper if the unit has been set to always boot into the serial console.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="JavaStationBoot-CoffeeCupLogo"></a>8.1.2. Stage 2: Coffee Cup Logo</h4></div></div></div><p>
When contact is made with the DHCP server, the logo goes away and changes 
to the Java coffee cup logo.  The screen is still white background.  The
logo should be solid, and not blinking.  This step lasts a second or two,
as the unit should already be contacting the TFTP server and downloading the
boot image.
</p><p>
If your coffee logo is blinking, it means there is a problem getting your
IP address, usually due to a DHCP leasing problem.  Check your DHCP server's
logs to see that your JavaStation's mac address is being sent a proper
IP address.  
</p><p>
If your JavaStation doesn't even get a blinking coffee cup, check both
your DHCP and RARP server settings.  Also, if running the ISC DHCP server,
you may be having a problem with 1514-byte packets and need the patch from 
the ZLS website.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="JavaStationBoot-Proll"></a>8.1.3. Stage 3: A Window to PROLL</h4></div></div></div><p>
After the coffee cup logo is solid a few seconds, a white-text on black 
background window opens.  This is the PROLL window.  It'll show status of 
the TFTP download in progress, and when finished will give stats on the 
size of the file downloaded.   The size should match your completed file.
When finished, the screen should read 'Booting Linux'.  Although, this goes
so fast you may not see it.
</p><p>
If you don't see the PROLL window open, confirm your TFTP settings are 
correct.  Also, verify you are pointing to a version of PROLL specific
to your JavaStation model.  In other words, PROLL for Krups is different
from PROLL for Mr. Coffee, and so on.
</p><p>
If, at the bottom of the PROLL window, the system prints the phrase
'obio_range' and hangs for minutes without end, the boot is halted,
and you are likely running an old version of PROLL.  Verify your PROLL 
version is the most recent and try again.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="JavaStationBoot-KernelBoot"></a>8.1.4. Stage 4: Kernel Boot</h4></div></div></div><p>
After PROLL finishes its work, the whole screen should go black. 
You should see a picture of the Linux logo, Tux the penguin, in 
the upper left hand of the screen.   At this point, messages
relating your kernel should be spilling down before you.  The
color of the text is either white or grey depending on your
monitor.
</p><p>
If the screen didn't flip, and you do not see Tux, chances are
you are using a kernel compiled with framebuffer support for a 
different JavaStation model than you are using.
</p><p>
After the message, 'decompressing kernel' appears and the kernel
begins spitting out its boot messages, any mistakes from
this point are due either to: the filesystem you are using, the 
filesystem mounting, or missing kernel drivers which should have 
been compiled in; in other words, your own fault.

There is a known limit of 8 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym> when using the
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> boot image option.
</p><p>
The cause of this is the current version of the <span class="application">PROLL

of low memory.  Any more and banking support would need to be
added to it.
</p><p>
If needed, this limit can be fixed by someone, as the source 
to <span class="application">PROLL</span> has been released under terms
of the General Public License (<acronym class="acronym">GPL</acronym>).
</p><p>
So in reality, the embedded image size limit is really 8 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>

</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you do <span class="application">X</span> sessions to a <span class="application">Solaris

</p><p>
The fix is to move the font server to a different OS and point your
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; there, or to upgrade your 
<span class="application">Solaris</span> to the 2.7 11/99 maintenance

Congratulations!  You probably have one of patch numbers 107180-12 through

</p><p>
I (your HOWTO author) reported this problem to Sun in November 1999, 
at which time I was told a fix was not scheduled to be made, since I 
was using an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unsupported configuration.</span>&#8221;</span>.   Never mind 
that the client was a piece of hardware made by Sun itself.  Also never 
mind that indirect <acronym class="acronym">XDMCP</acronym> queries is a standard itself 
which was broken by Sun.  A call back in late January 2000, and I learn that
the record of my previous call was non-existant, but a fix was now on
its way. The fix finally was made available in April 2000, five months
after first reporting the problem.  Considering revisions to this
patch during the broken <acronym class="acronym">XDMCP</acronym> period dealt with
fixing system security issues, we were forced to run the older insecure
software for five months while waiting for a fix to a problem which
should have been patched immediately.
</p><p>
The moral of the story: test your <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
configuration against an upgraded server that is not in production mode.
</p><p>
If you have XDMCP problems not related to these faulty Solaris patches,
it may be a new problem, so please report it.

This was reported by a user after this document was first released.
</p><p>
In SUSE 6.3, using the tftpd from the 'a' package of the netkit rpm,
you must be sure your tftpd line in /etc/inetd.conf has the -s flag.
Otherwise you need to specify a full path.
</p><p>
Also, it is not necessary to run tftpd as root, so the suggested username
and group for tftpd on SUSE 6.3 is 'nobody' and 'nogroup'
</p><p>
It is not known whether these changes are needed for newer versions of 
SUSE.

<acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> is not needed with the <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482; or <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; models and 
recent <span class="application">PROLL</span> software.  <acronym class="acronym">RARP
</acronym> is required for <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;, 
however.
</p><p>
This 'Server Configuration' chapter explained how to set up 
kernel-level <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> on 2.2.x systems.
</p><p>
On servers with kernel versions 2.3.x/2.4.x, kernel-level 
<acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> support is removed.  The ZLS holds a 
version of <span class="application"> ANK userland RARP</span> from Andi 
Klein of SuSE that will work with Linux/SPARC.  It is available 
from: <a class="ulink" href="http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/rarpd-ap1.tar.bz2" target="_top"> 
http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/rarpd-ap1.tar.bz2</a>.
The command to use then is <strong class="userinput"><code>rarpd-ank -e eth0</code></strong>.  
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">-e</span>&#8221;</span> makes it ignore /tftpboot checking, and 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">eth0</span>&#8221;</span> is needed if you are behind a firewall.

This is not currently supported, but the reader follows an 
ISO standard (ISO 7816-3).  On <span class="productname">
Espresso</span>&#8482;, if you look into <span class="application">PROLL</span>, 
there are definitions for the <acronym class="acronym">GPIO</acronym> smartcard data/clock in 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">eeprom.c</span>&#8221;</span>.  So a programmer should technically be able to get 
the Smart Card slot running.
</p><p>
Whether the smartcard reader on Dover and Espresso are equivalent is
not known.

server instead of <acronym class="acronym">ISC</acronym>?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Yes, this is possible.  Earlier ISC daemons had problems dealing
with 1514-byte requests of the JavaStations, while the Solaris 
server was able to handle them without problems. Also, former
users of JavaOS may already have their Solaris DHCP server
active, and wish to keep things on one machine.
</p><p>
Here is how to configure it: 
</p><p>
First, fill in your /var/dhcp/<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">networks</span>&#8221;</span> file, populating
it with ethernet to IP info, and the appropriate leastime.

This is a very frequently asked question.
</p><p>
Enabling <span class="application">X</span> on the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; is possible.  
</p><p>
First, be sure you have enabled the appropriate framebuffer device
in your kernel's configuration, as described in the "Kernel Build" 
chapter. 
</p><p>
Next, you'll want to use the generic <span class="application">Sun Framebuffer X server
</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">XF86Config</span>&#8221;</span> file.  You can build this 
yourself, or you can try someone's prebuilt binaries, such as the samples
pointed to in the "FileSystem Build" chapter.
</p><p>
Recent editions of the framebuffer server coinciding with XFree 4 are
reported not to work.  Use the older version based on XFree 3.3, or 
fix the new version and be a hero to thousands.

There are two mailing devoted exclusively to running <span class="application">Linux
</span> on <span class="hardware">SPARC processor</span> based machines 
such as the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;.
</p><p>
The first mailing list is the sparclinux list on VGER, 
at <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:sparclinux@vger.kernel.org">sparclinux@vger.kernel.org</a>&gt;</code>. 
You should first subscribe to it by sending a message to 
<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:majordomo@vger.kernel.org">majordomo@vger.kernel.org</a>&gt;</code> with a subject and body line 
of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">subscribe sparclinux &lt;your_email_address&gt;</span>&#8221;</span>.  You 
can leave out your email address, but it is helpful to put it in if you 
have multiple valid addresses at your site.
</p><p>
Archives of the VGER sparclinux mailing list are kept at: 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-sparc&amp;r=1&amp;%20w=2" target="_top">http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-sparc&amp;r=1&amp;w=2"

</p><p>
The second mailing list is the debian-sparc list at the Debian Project,

</p><p>
As many of the SPARC kernel hackers run Debian, it is helpful to
subscribe to both lists.

Please do not report problems about this document to either list, but
send them to <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:rsd@dubinski-family.org">rsd@dubinski-family.org</a>&gt;</code> instead.  Also, 
please use the list archives.  JavaStations have been supported on

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-FlashBootFAQSection"></a>9.15. Can One Boot a JavaStation from Onboard Flash Memory?</h3></div></div></div><p>
It is possible to boot a JavaStation-NC from flash, but requires
too much arcane knowledge at the moment to be recommended.  One problem
even if you do go this route is that flash can only be mounted read-only.
This gets to be a problem with many things, like X, which require the
writing of socket files.  A hybrid ramdisk/flash solution would be required.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-PiggybackOtherPlatform"></a>9.16. Does <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Piggyback</span>&#8221;</span> work for the <span class="hardware">x86</span> 
too?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
With the great embedded-root solution for the JavaStations, the question
popped up whether something similar can be done for stock x86 hardware.
While there are some x86 NICs that have boot roms on them, you'd also need
the piggyback program to put things together.  According to Eric Brower,
this currently is not possible as the piggyback program looks for a header
specific to the SPARC platform. (28-Apr-2000)
</p><p>
Robert Thornburrow<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:robert@tsac.fsnet.co.uk">robert@tsac.fsnet.co.uk</a>&gt;</code> sent a version
of piggyback which runs on non-SPARCLinux architectures like Linux/x86
and Solaris.  This automates the task of creating your embedded root
image. You can get his updated piggyback package at:

Are you using EDO memory by chance?  Mr. Coffee uses fast-page memory
only, not EDO.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-AlternateOSSupport"></a>9.18. Now that JavaStations work with Linux, what about other Free OSs?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
JavaStation support is now available with the NetBSD OS as well as Linux.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-Linux24Support"></a>9.19. Do the Linux 2.4 kernels work? What's the latest that works?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
As of this date (Oct 31, 2001), the current stable Linux kernel version
is 2.4.13.  Kernels in the stable 2.4 series <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> 
work with the JavaStations, but there are a few reasons why they may not 
work for you.  For details, check the "Kernel Build" chapter's entry on
supported kernels.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-CrossCompileKernel"></a>9.20. Can I compile the kernel on a non-SPARC machine?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
It should be technically possible to compile your kernel on a
non Sun workstation, such as a PC.  Currently there are no reports
of anyone doing this, but if you wanted, the first place to look is
the GCC CrossCompiling HOWTO.
</p><p>
Of course, you can also compile a new kernel on a working JavaStation,
if your filesystem image supports it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-OpenBootBreak"></a>9.21. Can I get an ok&gt; prompt like other Sun equipment?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
A curious thing happens when you send a JavaStation a break: it resets,
not break down to the openboot prom prompt like other Sun equipment.
This can be changed on a Krups by setting jumper J1300, pins 7-8. 
Doing this gets a OBP ok prompt with a Ctrl-Alt-Break on a PS/2 keyboard
or break through a serial terminal.
</p><p>
You can also get the ok prompt on the Dover unit, but it requires a hardware
fix.  To do so on this unit, you must solder a 220K ohm resistor in 
location R362 (near the FDD connector).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-KeyboardTroubleshooting"></a>9.22. My keyboard isn't recognized.  What can I do?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
While it's unlikely, it could be possible that you have a javastation
set in the wrong input device mode.  To rectify this, you need to enable
the openboot prom prompt as described elsewhere in this HOWTO, and then
set the 'input-device' directive accordingly.  Or, as one contributor
did before the OBP setting was discovered, load up NetBSD on your 
JavaStation and run the eeprom command there.  Convoluted, but it 
works too.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-ProllARPTimeOut"></a>9.23. Proll reports "TFTP: ARP Timeout".  Why?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
This has been reported to happen when the file PROLL looks for isn't
available.  Doublecheck your configuration before retrying.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-TrueColorKrups"></a>9.24. Why Can't I Get TrueColor on Krups?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Truecolor on Krups with Linux is a bit of a controversy.  Some believe
it is possible, while others do not.  
</p><p>
First, the Krups is listed as having the IGS C1682 framebuffer, while 
the Espresso has the IGS C2000 chip.
</p><p>
According to an earlier report by one kernel hacker, the reason for Krups 
not supporting TrueColor is due to lack of kernel support for the Cyber2000
chip.  Perhaps the C2000 for the Espresso is the 'Cyber2000'?  And perhaps
the C2000 is near equal to the C1682.  Notes on the ZLS website seem
to point to this.
</p><p>
Recent 2.4.x series kernels have an entry labeled 'Cyber2000'.  Perhaps this
works?  One contributor tried and failed.
</p><p>
Ok, there is a userland utility called 'fbset' to change the modes of
a framebuffer.  Does that work?  One contributor said no.
</p><p>
In the sparclinux archives is a report of a user using the 24-bit TCX
framebuffer and having success.  But TCX chip was in Mr. Coffee, not
Krups, and TCX onboard Mr. Coffee had 8-bit max, not 24.
</p><p>
So what is the real scoop with 24-bit color on the Krups?  Until others
try things and speak up, we don't know.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-DoverHOWTO"></a>9.25. I followed this HOWTO, but my Dover doesn't work.  Why?</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Dover is not a SPARC-based JavaStation, which this HOWTO caters to.
You must use x86 procedures to make it work properly.  You did read the
warning in the Dover introduction section, didn't you?
</p><p>
I am receiving multiple reports of kernel load failures with the Dover unit.
As more information comes in, this HOWTO will present it.

If you boot a JavaStation via the serial console, the framebuffer console
is completely disabled.  Is there any way to activate the framebuffer console
after booting? (asked on Sparclinux mailing list 2001-05-11).

Not to our knowledge.

Download the link labeled 'jdse.tar'.  JDSE 1.0.1 was one of the

is merely a boot image of JavaOS and the HotJava browser.  No telnet or

but the browser.  Starting to feel boxed in?   Welcome to the official 
software of the JavaStation.

Copies of latter versions of JavaOS as included in the NetraJ software

USE THIS INFORMATION ON YOUR OWN RISK.

IDE interrupt line is connected "upside down" on the Espresso.
To have IDE working we need to insert an invertor in it.
We borrow the invertor from ISA IRQ3. If you want to use ISA
modem, set it to use COM3/IRQ4 (please realize that Linux IRQ
level would be programmed in CPU PCIC).

I recommend to proceed in the following way:

1. Disconnect 1202 5 &amp; 6. Not knowing if I need them I lifted pins with a
model knife. You may just cut them with side cutters.

2. Lift pins 1200 10 &amp; 11 but do not cut them!

3. Run wires from resistor pads "A" to pin 1200 11 and from pad "B" to
   pin 1200 10. Resistor pads are much easier targets for soldering at home
   than pads under pins 1202 5 &amp; 6. I am a software engineer, so I did it
   the easy way.

   I did not bother to glue wires as a decent electronics hacker would do.

   You are all set. Get kernel 2.4, hack drivers/block/Config.in and enjoy!

   P.S. Let me know if you have drawings of hard drive brackets for Espresso.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p></blockquote></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1818"></a>0. Preamble</h2></div></div></div><p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</p><p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1823"></a>1. Applicability and Definitions</h2></div></div></div><p>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</p><p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</p><p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</p><p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p><p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p><p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p><p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</p><p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1833"></a>2. Verbatim Copying</h2></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1837"></a>3. Copying in Quantity</h2></div></div></div><p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1843"></a>4. Modifications</h2></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>Use in the Title Page

      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In any section entitled

    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1879"></a>5. Combining Documents</h2></div></div></div><p>You may combine the Document with other documents released

    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1884"></a>6. Collections of Documents</h2></div></div></div><p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and

    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and

    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm1892"></a>8. Translation</h2></div></div></div><p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will

    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present

    concerns.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the

    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1

    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</p><p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
