This likely means you have a flash SIMM install, and the flash SIMM has
JavaOS loaded on it.  Remove the SIMM and the problem should go away.

</acronym>on my <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;.  Why?</h3></div></div></div><p>
There is a known limit of 8 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym> when using the
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Embedded-Root</span>&#8221;</span> boot image option.
</p><p>
The cause of this is the current version of the <span class="application">PROLL
</span> software, which map only 8 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym> 
of low memory.  Any more and banking support would need to be
added to it.
</p><p>
If needed, this limit can be fixed by someone, as the source 
to <span class="application">PROLL</span> has been released under terms
of the General Public License (<acronym class="acronym">GPL</acronym>).
</p><p>
So in reality, the embedded image size limit is really 8 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>
, not 10 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym>.  If 10 <acronym class="acronym">MB</acronym> somehow works

font server <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xfs</span>&#8221;</span> crashes. Why?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you do <span class="application">X</span> sessions to a <span class="application">Solaris
</span> server, and you find that your sessions are no longer opening 
up new windows, chances are the font server on the <span class="application">Solaris 
</span> host has crashed.  This is a known bug in <span class="application">
Solaris</span> 2.6 and 2.7 when you have about 2 dozen <span class="hardware">
X terminals</span> sessions running.   
</p><p>
The fix is to move the font server to a different OS and point your
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; there, or to upgrade your 
<span class="application">Solaris</span> to the 2.7 11/99 maintenance
release or <span class="application">Solaris 8</span> which both (apparently) 
have fixes to this problem.

</h3></div></div></div><p>
Congratulations!  You probably have one of patch numbers 107180-12 through
107180-19 installed on a <span class="application">Solaris 7</span>
server.  You need to upgrade to 107180-20 or above to fix this problem.
</p><p>
I (your HOWTO author) reported this problem to Sun in November 1999, 
at which time I was told a fix was not scheduled to be made, since I 
was using an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unsupported configuration.</span>&#8221;</span>.   Never mind 
that the client was a piece of hardware made by Sun itself.  Also never 
mind that indirect <acronym class="acronym">XDMCP</acronym> queries is a standard itself 
which was broken by Sun.  A call back in late January 2000, and I learn that
the record of my previous call was non-existant, but a fix was now on
its way. The fix finally was made available in April 2000, five months
after first reporting the problem.  Considering revisions to this
patch during the broken <acronym class="acronym">XDMCP</acronym> period dealt with
fixing system security issues, we were forced to run the older insecure
software for five months while waiting for a fix to a problem which
should have been patched immediately.
</p><p>
The moral of the story: test your <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
configuration against an upgraded server that is not in production mode.
</p><p>
If you have XDMCP problems not related to these faulty Solaris patches,
it may be a new problem, so please report it.

This was reported by a user after this document was first released.
</p><p>
In SUSE 6.3, using the tftpd from the 'a' package of the netkit rpm,
you must be sure your tftpd line in /etc/inetd.conf has the -s flag.
Otherwise you need to specify a full path.
</p><p>
Also, it is not necessary to run tftpd as root, so the suggested username
and group for tftpd on SUSE 6.3 is 'nobody' and 'nogroup'
</p><p>
It is not known whether these changes are needed for newer versions of 
SUSE.

<acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> is not needed with the <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482; or <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; models and 
recent <span class="application">PROLL</span> software.  <acronym class="acronym">RARP
</acronym> is required for <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;, 
however.
</p><p>
This 'Server Configuration' chapter explained how to set up 
kernel-level <acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> on 2.2.x systems.
</p><p>
On servers with kernel versions 2.3.x/2.4.x, kernel-level 
<acronym class="acronym">RARP</acronym> support is removed.  The ZLS holds a 
version of <span class="application"> ANK userland RARP</span> from Andi 
Klein of SuSE that will work with Linux/SPARC.  It is available 
from: <a class="ulink" href="http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/rarpd-ap1.tar.bz2" target="_top"> 
http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/rarpd-ap1.tar.bz2</a>.
The command to use then is <strong class="userinput"><code>rarpd-ank -e eth0</code></strong>.  
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">-e</span>&#8221;</span> makes it ignore /tftpboot checking, and 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">eth0</span>&#8221;</span> is needed if you are behind a firewall.

This is not currently supported, but the reader follows an 
ISO standard (ISO 7816-3).  On <span class="productname">
Espresso</span>&#8482;, if you look into <span class="application">PROLL</span>, 
there are definitions for the <acronym class="acronym">GPIO</acronym> smartcard data/clock in 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">eeprom.c</span>&#8221;</span>.  So a programmer should technically be able to get 
the Smart Card slot running.
</p><p>
Whether the smartcard reader on Dover and Espresso are equivalent is
not known.

server instead of <acronym class="acronym">ISC</acronym>?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Yes, this is possible.  Earlier ISC daemons had problems dealing
with 1514-byte requests of the JavaStations, while the Solaris 
server was able to handle them without problems. Also, former
users of JavaOS may already have their Solaris DHCP server
active, and wish to keep things on one machine.
</p><p>
Here is how to configure it: 
</p><p>
First, fill in your /var/dhcp/<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">networks</span>&#8221;</span> file, populating
it with ethernet to IP info, and the appropriate leastime.
</p><pre class="screen">

This is a very frequently asked question.
</p><p>
Enabling <span class="application">X</span> on the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; is possible.  
</p><p>
First, be sure you have enabled the appropriate framebuffer device
in your kernel's configuration, as described in the "Kernel Build" 
chapter. 
</p><p>
Next, you'll want to use the generic <span class="application">Sun Framebuffer X server
</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">XF86Config</span>&#8221;</span> file.  You can build this 
yourself, or you can try someone's prebuilt binaries, such as the samples
pointed to in the "FileSystem Build" chapter.
</p><p>
Recent editions of the framebuffer server coinciding with XFree 4 are
reported not to work.  Use the older version based on XFree 3.3, or 
fix the new version and be a hero to thousands.

such as the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;.
</p><p>
The first mailing list is the sparclinux list on VGER, 
at <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:sparclinux@vger.kernel.org">sparclinux@vger.kernel.org</a>&gt;</code>. 
You should first subscribe to it by sending a message to

It is possible to boot a JavaStation-NC from flash, but requires
too much arcane knowledge at the moment to be recommended.  One problem
even if you do go this route is that flash can only be mounted read-only.
This gets to be a problem with many things, like X, which require the
writing of socket files.  A hybrid ramdisk/flash solution would be required.

too?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
With the great embedded-root solution for the JavaStations, the question
popped up whether something similar can be done for stock x86 hardware.
While there are some x86 NICs that have boot roms on them, you'd also need
the piggyback program to put things together.  According to Eric Brower,
this currently is not possible as the piggyback program looks for a header
specific to the SPARC platform. (28-Apr-2000)
</p><p>
Robert Thornburrow<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:robert@tsac.fsnet.co.uk">robert@tsac.fsnet.co.uk</a>&gt;</code> sent a version
of piggyback which runs on non-SPARCLinux architectures like Linux/x86
and Solaris.  This automates the task of creating your embedded root
image. You can get his updated piggyback package at:

only, not EDO.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-Linux24Support"></a>9.19. Do the Linux 2.4 kernels work? What's the latest that works?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
As of this date (Oct 31, 2001), the current stable Linux kernel version
is 2.4.13.  Kernels in the stable 2.4 series <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> 
work with the JavaStations, but there are a few reasons why they may not 
work for you.  For details, check the "Kernel Build" chapter's entry on
supported kernels.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-CrossCompileKernel"></a>9.20. Can I compile the kernel on a non-SPARC machine?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
It should be technically possible to compile your kernel on a
non Sun workstation, such as a PC.  Currently there are no reports
of anyone doing this, but if you wanted, the first place to look is
the GCC CrossCompiling HOWTO.
</p><p>
Of course, you can also compile a new kernel on a working JavaStation,
if your filesystem image supports it.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-OpenBootBreak"></a>9.21. Can I get an ok&gt; prompt like other Sun equipment?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
A curious thing happens when you send a JavaStation a break: it resets,
not break down to the openboot prom prompt like other Sun equipment.
This can be changed on a Krups by setting jumper J1300, pins 7-8. 
Doing this gets a OBP ok prompt with a Ctrl-Alt-Break on a PS/2 keyboard
or break through a serial terminal.
</p><p>
You can also get the ok prompt on the Dover unit, but it requires a hardware
fix.  To do so on this unit, you must solder a 220K ohm resistor in 
location R362 (near the FDD connector).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-KeyboardTroubleshooting"></a>9.22. My keyboard isn't recognized.  What can I do?
</h3></div></div></div><p>
While it's unlikely, it could be possible that you have a javastation
set in the wrong input device mode.  To rectify this, you need to enable
the openboot prom prompt as described elsewhere in this HOWTO, and then
set the 'input-device' directive accordingly.  Or, as one contributor
did before the OBP setting was discovered, load up NetBSD on your 
JavaStation and run the eeprom command there.  Convoluted, but it 
works too.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-TrueColorKrups"></a>9.24. Why Can't I Get TrueColor on Krups?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Truecolor on Krups with Linux is a bit of a controversy.  Some believe
it is possible, while others do not.  
</p><p>
First, the Krups is listed as having the IGS C1682 framebuffer, while 
the Espresso has the IGS C2000 chip.
</p><p>
According to an earlier report by one kernel hacker, the reason for Krups 
not supporting TrueColor is due to lack of kernel support for the Cyber2000
chip.  Perhaps the C2000 for the Espresso is the 'Cyber2000'?  And perhaps
the C2000 is near equal to the C1682.  Notes on the ZLS website seem
to point to this.
</p><p>
Recent 2.4.x series kernels have an entry labeled 'Cyber2000'.  Perhaps this
works?  One contributor tried and failed.
</p><p>
Ok, there is a userland utility called 'fbset' to change the modes of
a framebuffer.  Does that work?  One contributor said no.
</p><p>
In the sparclinux archives is a report of a user using the 24-bit TCX
framebuffer and having success.  But TCX chip was in Mr. Coffee, not
Krups, and TCX onboard Mr. Coffee had 8-bit max, not 24.
</p><p>
So what is the real scoop with 24-bit color on the Krups?  Until others
try things and speak up, we don't know.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="QuestionsandTroubleshooting-DoverHOWTO"></a>9.25. I followed this HOWTO, but my Dover doesn't work.  Why?</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Dover is not a SPARC-based JavaStation, which this HOWTO caters to.
You must use x86 procedures to make it work properly.  You did read the
warning in the Dover introduction section, didn't you?
</p><p>
I am receiving multiple reports of kernel load failures with the Dover unit.
As more information comes in, this HOWTO will present it.

If you boot a JavaStation via the serial console, the framebuffer console
is completely disabled.  Is there any way to activate the framebuffer console
after booting? (asked on Sparclinux mailing list 2001-05-11).
</p><p>
Not to our knowledge.

You better get busy then.

So ask it.  Email <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:rsd@dubinski-family.org">rsd@dubinski-family.org</a>&gt;</code> and I will
try to help.   If I can not help, I will direct you to the mailing
lists or suitable contacts.
