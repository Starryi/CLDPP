</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> is a 
model line of network computers built and sold by 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sun.com" target="_top">Sun Microsystems</a> between 
November 1996 and March 2000.  The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
line was Sun's low-cost terminal option during that timeframe.   It
was the marketed successor to the Xterminal 1 and is succeeeded by the
SunRay, although all three machines are fundamentally different.
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; hardware ran Sun's 
own <span class="application">JavaOS</span> and either Sun's <span class="application">
Hotjava</span> web browser, Sun's <span class="application">HotJava Views
</span> task-manager software, or custom <span class="application">Java
</span> applications of the customer's choice. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; was originally billed in 
November 1996 sneak previews as a low-cost desktop terminal, 
providing customers access to hot new <span class="application">Java</span> 
applications, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="application">X</span> applications, 
and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="application">MS Windows</span> apps.  
During its lifetime, The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;'s marketed 
functionality was changed twice from <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop terminal</span>&#8221;</span> to 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">single-app desktop device</span>&#8221;</span> to finally a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">browser-based 
kiosk device</span>&#8221;</span>.
</p><p>
At no time did Sun market the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; as 
capable of running its flagship 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sun.com/solaris" target="_top">Solaris</a> operating system 
the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux.com" target="_top">Linux OS</a>, or any other
OS than Sun's JavaOS.

from <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s</h3></div></div></div><p>
A network computer, or <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>, was hailed as 
"the next big thing" in computing from late 1995 to early 1998.  
Conventional <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s, called "fat clients", were 
expected to be minimized in businesses by thin-client 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s. 
</p><p>
Thin-clients get their <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym>, applications, and data 
files entirely through the network.  They are different from 
dumb-terminals;  they run full-scale graphical applications.  
Thin-clients are also different than graphical X-terminals.  
X-terminals typically run an X server and display the client programs of 
a remote server.  Thin clients generally run full-scale graphical 
programs locally, such as a web browser, a <span class="application">Java</span> 
application, or a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy-connectivity program</span>&#8221;</span>, which enables 
the thin-client to display <span class="application">X</span> apps or 
<span class="application">MS Windows</span> apps which run on more
powerful servers. 
</p><p>
Advantages of <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s include: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Zero-Administration</span>&#8221;</span>.  (Add a new <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> and 
it will get <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> it needs off the network, 
without an admin ever needing to visit it.)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Lower Total-Cost-of-Ownership (<acronym class="acronym">TCO</acronym>) (No internal 
hard drives, floppy drives or <acronym class="acronym">CD</acronym> players reduces 
form-factor, repair expenses, selling price and thus total-cost-of-ownership.)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Access to all web-based apps as well as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legacy</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="application">X
</span> and <span class="application">MS Windows</span> apps.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Quick upgrades (just upgrade your server and the changes propogate throughout)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Longer lifespan (just upgrade the software, growing hard disk and memory 
requirements is not an issue)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Smaller <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> footprint (when running brower-based apps)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Disadvantages of <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
No local access to data files (all your files stored on a remote server)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Requires fast, stable networks
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
NC's generally have a low maximum amount of memory.  Though not as bad
as with fat-clients, this does eventually become a liability for the 
thin-client.

This model is the most prevalent <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; model 
you are likely to find, although it wasn't the one and only 
<span class="emphasis"><em><span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;</em></span> model Sun wished 
to sell to the public.  The <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; was the 
first generation <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;, released in 
November 1996 to pilot deployments as Sun's <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">proof of concept</span>&#8221;</span> 
of the Java <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> design.  
</p><p>
Hardware-wise, the <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; is a 
Sun4M architecture machine.  It is based on the <span class="productname">SPARCStation-4
</span>&#8482; design, with some deletions and <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>-like 
modifications.  It is powered by a <span class="hardware">110 Mhz MicroSPARC IIe 
CPU</span> and has no <span class="hardware">SCSI</span>, <span class="hardware">internal disks
</span>, <span class="hardware">floppy</span>, <span class="hardware">CD</span> or 
<span class="hardware">expansion slots</span>.  The <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee
</span>&#8482; <span class="hardware">motherboard</span> is Sun Part 
No. <span class="productnumber">501-3141</span>. 
</p><p>
Instead of using the Sun-type <span class="hardware">keyboard</span> and 
<span class="hardware">mice</span>, <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; 
uses <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>-like <span class="hardware">PS2</span> parts instead.  
One of the original marketing highlights of the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; was that it would use standard <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym> parts 
wherever possible to keep overall price down. 
</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">brick</span>&#8221;</span> has four <span class="hardware">PC-like SIMM</span> 
slots.  The <span class="hardware">SIMMs</span> taken are industry-standard 
60ns, 32-bit, 72-pin, 5V fast page <span class="hardware">SIMMs</span>, 
installed in pairs.  Each slot is capable of holding up to a 
<span class="hardware">16MB SIMM</span>, bringing the maximum total capacity 
of the unit to 64MB.  The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xx</span>&#8221;</span> in the Sun Option# of the 
unit indicated how much memory the unit shipped with.
</p><p>
For video display, the <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; utilizes 
the <span class="hardware">Sun TCX framebuffer</span>, capable of 1024x768@70Hz in 
8-bit color.  The port connector however, is a <span class="hardware">standard VGA jack
</span>, enabling the user to use standard <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym> 
<span class="hardware">monitors</span> if desired (again, low cost in mind).  
The <span class="hardware">on-board audio</span> is a <span class="hardware">Crystal CS4231 chip
</span>, and the network interface is the <span class="hardware">Sun Lance</span> 
10Mbps interface.  In addition, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">brick</span>&#8221;</span> also came with 
a <span class="hardware">9-pin serial port</span> and <span class="hardware">1/8" audio out jack
</span> on its back.  
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; was fitted into the Sun 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unidisk</span>&#8221;</span> form factor case, and has been seen in a number 
of color schemes.  <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; have been 
fitted with casings in the white with light blue trim scheme used in 
<span class="hardware">Sun workstations</span>, as well as the dark blue-grey 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">new desktop</span>&#8221;</span> scheme.  Some say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>
and have the Java coffee cup logo written on it, others do not.  
Collectors may wish to collect all case variations.
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482; was used in early 
Sun demos, and sold to pilot sites.  When first brought out, the 
cost to pilot sites was $699US.   This was at a time when <acronym class="acronym">PC
</acronym>'s were still higher than $1000US.  By the end of the pilot
run, Sun was selling any remaining or used units for $299-$399US, in
anticipation for its <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">real</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; model.

</h4></div></div></div><p>
This model is the second most prevalent <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
model you are likely to find.  When you talk to industry people about the 
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>, this is typically the model remembered first.  
Delayed numerous times, the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; model 
officially went on sale to the general public Mar. 26, 1998 at the annual 
JavaOne conference. 
</p><p>
Though generation two of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; line, the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; model was <span class="emphasis"><em>the JavaStation</em></span>
.  Sporting a completely different board design than <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;, <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; establishes what was to be 
the characteristic <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; architecture. 
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; is powered by a 
<span class="hardware">100Mhz MicroSPARC IIep</span> chip, (note the 'p'). 
Its mainboard had the internal addition of a <span class="hardware">PCI bus</span>, 
about a year before this standard bus made its well-publicized 
appearance on the <span class="productname">Sun Ultra</span>&#8482; workstation 
line. The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; <span class="hardware">motherboard</span> 
is Sun Part no. <span class="productnumber">501-4267</span>.
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; keeps the <span class="hardware">PS2 keyboard</span> 
and <span class="hardware">PS2 mouse ports</span> from <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;, keeping in mind the low-cost, interoperable goal of 
generation 1. 
</p><p>
With the new board design, came new memory chip sockets.  Instead of
<span class="hardware">SIMMs</span>, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower</span>&#8221;</span> moved to <span class="hardware">
168-pin DIMMs</span>.  <span class="hardware">DIMMs</span> had begun to make 
their way from the workstation realm to <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s in the 
time between generations one and two of the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; line, so it was fitting for Sun to switch to
it in anticipation of their status low-cost commodity memory chips. The
<span class="hardware">DIMMs</span> accepted by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower</span>&#8221;</span> are 
<span class="hardware">168pin, 3.3V unbuffered EDO DIMMs (not SDRAM)</span>.  With 
two sockets capable of holding a <span class="hardware">32MB DIMM</span> each, the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; has a maximum capacity of 64<acronym class="acronym">MB
</acronym> <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym>. As with the <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;, the number <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xx</span>&#8221;</span> in the Sun option number 
refers to the amount of memory shipped with the unit. 
</p><p>
For video display, the <span class="productname">JavaStation-NC</span>&#8482; utilizes 
the <span class="hardware">PCI-based IGS C1682 framebuffer</span>, 
capable of 1280x1024@80Hz in 24-bit <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">true color</span>&#8221;</span>.  This 
is a step up from the 8-bit display on <span class="productname">JavaStation-1
</span>&#8482;.  The port connector remained a <span class="hardware">standard VGA jack
</span> like <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;, enabling the 
user to use standard <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym> monitors if desired.
The on-board audio remains a <span class="hardware">Crystal 
CS4231 chip</span> like <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;. 
The network interface on <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; is the 
<span class="hardware">Sun HappyMeal</span> 10/100 Mbps interface, another step 
up from the original offering of <span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;.
</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower</span>&#8221;</span> came with the <span class="hardware">9-pin serial port
</span> and <span class="hardware">1/8" audio out jack</span> as 
<span class="productname">JavaStation-1</span>&#8482;, but it also added a 
<span class="hardware">1/8" audio-in jack</span>, to do sound recording with. 
</p><p>
Another addition in the <span class="productname">JavaStation-NC</span>&#8482; is a 
<span class="hardware">flash memory SIMM</span>.  This allows one to load the 
current revision of the <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> onboard, increasing 
boot-speed tremendously. 
</p><p>
Perhaps the thing most memorable about the <span class="productname">JavaStation-NC
</span>&#8482; is its case design.  The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; 
comes in an aesthetically appealing casing.  The <span class="hardware">mainboard</span> 
is mounted vertically, and the shell entraps it, giving it the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tower
</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">percolator</span>&#8221;</span> shape referred to.  With the 
streamlined case, the <span class="hardware">power supply</span> is moved outside 
to small transformer.  The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; unit gives 
off so little heat that there are no onboard cooling fans, making the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; a <span class="emphasis"><em>dead-silent</em></span> 
machine.  Imagine the difference in noise when replacing a lab of 
traditional desktops with the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;!  
This case design earned <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; a<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
1998 Industrial Design Excellence Award</span>&#8221;</span> from the Industrial

The <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; had an initial base price of $599US, 
$100US cheaper than <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;'s rollout price.  
Due to it being the only model formally sold by Sun to the general public, 
this is how <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; is sometimes referred to as 
the only <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;, and not one model of a 
product line.

[Sun Option No. JE-xx]
</h4></div></div></div><p>
This model is extremely rare to find.  It was never available for
sale in quantities to either the general public or the initial 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; deployments, limiting the
model's production quantity.  To call this <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Generation 
Three</span>&#8221;</span> of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
may be improper, as <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; is nothing like 
the generation three <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; written about 
in early Sun marketing literature. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; was designed as an extension of 
the <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;.   It was geared to sites that 
wanted a little bit more functionality and expansion capability from 
their <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;: a cross between an 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> and a workstation.
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; is powered by the same 
<span class="hardware">110Mhz MicroSPARC IIep chip</span> as <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482;.  It's mainboard is similar to <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;,
with the addition of <span class="hardware">PCI slots</span> and an <span class="hardware">IDE 
channel</span> for local hard disks.  The <span class="hardware">IDE</span> on 
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; was not enabled in the demo units.
Those who have tried to make it work have concluded the wiring is incorrect,
and it requires a hardware rework to get going.
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; continues with the <span class="hardware">PS2 keyboard
</span> and <span class="hardware">PS2 mouse ports</span> from <span class="productname">
Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;. 
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; uses the same <span class="hardware">168-pin, 
3.3V unbuffered EDO DIMMs</span> as <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;.  
The maximum amount of memory for Espresso is reported to be 96MB. 
As with the <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482;, the number <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xx</span>&#8221;</span> in the Sun option number 
refers to the amount of memory shipped with the unit. 
</p><p>
For video display, the <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; uses the 
<span class="hardware">PCI-based IGS C2000 framebuffer</span>, along with the same 
standard <span class="hardware">VGA port connector</span> as <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482; and <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;.  The 
on-board audio remains a <span class="hardware">Crystal CS4231 chip</span> like 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;, and the network interface remains a 
<span class="hardware">Sun HappyMeal</span> 10/100 Mbps interface like 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482; as well.   
</p><p>
<span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; came with the <span class="hardware">9-pin serial 
port</span> and <span class="hardware">1/8" audio out</span> and 
<span class="hardware">1/8" audio in</span> jacks of <span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;, 
and a new addition of a  <span class="hardware">parallel port</span>, and a second
9-pin serial port.  <span class="productname"> Espresso</span>&#8482; also comes 
with the <span class="hardware">flash memory</span> to load your <acronym class="acronym">OS</acronym> 
on and bypass the network boot cycle. 
</p><p>
One new addition to the <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; is a 
<span class="hardware">smart card slot</span>. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; comes in a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pizza box</span>&#8221;</span> 
style case like the old <span class="productname">Sun SparcStations</span>&#8482;, only 
a little taller, and not quite as wide. 
</p><p>
The <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; was never sold to the public.  There 
was an internal testing period at Sun, but the units never went into 
mass-production.
</p><p>
One <span class="productname">Espresso</span>&#8482; user mentioned he now uses 
his unit as both a server and router, with the addition of an 
<span class="hardware">IDE disk</span> and <span class="hardware">3C905 ethernet card</span>, 
demonstrating the expandability of this unit.

The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Dover</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; model
</h4></div></div></div><p>
This is another box which does not exist officially outside of Sun.  
Little was known of it at the first revision of this HOWTO.  Since then,
proud owners have stepped forward.  Basically, the Dover takes the Espresso 
theme and moves it to stock X86 parts.  
</p><p>
Dover comes in a case similar to the Espresso, but there's nothing where
the 'JavaStation-E' tag would be.  Dover can be situated in a vertical
position by removable feet.  All that is printed on the case is "Sun
MicroSystems 1998", and typically a serial number sticker of '12345678'
and 'Made in Taiwan'.
</p><p>
The motherboard is 'baby ATX' in configuration, but not
quite totally.  Near the front of the case is a fan that points
at the CPU heat sink.  The CPU heat sink has another fan on top of it. 
The motherboard has a Socket 7 CPU socket that houses a Cyrix MediaGCm-266GP
CPU.  There are typical PC motherboard jumpers with silk-screened legends 
for setting both clock speed and multiplier.  The motherboard accepts
a PC100 DIMM (max. size unknown) and a powersupply with AT-type power
connectors.  Included among them are two floppy and regular hard
drive type plug.  There are two small jumpers going to the motherboard,
JPSB1 and JAUTO1, possibly for power management.
</p><p>
Expansion in Dover is via a two-card riser, with one PCI and one shared
PCI/ISA slot.  As mentioned earlier, the motherboard deviates slightly from
standard ATX. Along the back edge under the cards are
connectors for audio out, audio in, mic, HD15F video, two USB ports, 
D25F parallel printer, stacked PS/2 keyboard/mouse ports, and four
9-pin serial ports, marked A through D.  Unlike other JavaStation models,
there is no on-board ethernet.  Instead, it typically is provided by a 
supplied 3COM 3C905B-TX Fast Etherlink XL PCI card (with a wake-on-LAN 
cable going to the motherboard).  There is a standard Sun MAC address 
label on the back of the case.
</p><p>
Video is via a Cyrix CX5530 chip, but with the MediaGX chip, may be
just an auxilliary chip.  There exist both a FDD and HDD headers on the
motherboard, but nowhere to mount a FDD in the case and no provision
for an HDD bracket either.  There is a simple piezo buzzer mounted to 
the motherboard and additionally a speaker with a cable leading back 
near the audio out jacks.  Like the Espresso, there is a smart-card 
reader as well, and what looks like a compact-flash socket inside.
</p><p>
When booting it up, you get a blue JS screen.  Under the
exclamation point, are two memory card icons and a &lt;...&gt; 
icon.  It reads:
</p><pre class="screen">

ok

The Dover model, since it is based on an x86 chip, is supported by Linux.
This HOWTO however focuses on the SPARC-based JavaStations, so the procedures
presented here <span class="emphasis"><em>will not work</em></span> with it.  However, 
there's plenty of x86 documentation at large to work from.

The Generation 3 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Super JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>
</h4></div></div></div><p>
Sun originally envisioned three generation models of the <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482;: <span class="productname">Mr. Coffee</span>&#8482;, the 
<span class="productname">Krups</span>&#8482;, and the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Super JavaStation</span>&#8221;</span>.   
Generation Three was billed in early literature as going to be the fastest 
<span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; offered, with a high-speed 
<span class="hardware">CPU</span> and a <span class="hardware">JavaChip co-processor</span> 
to translate <span class="application">Java-bytecode</span> in hardware.
</p><p>
All indications are that it never got beyond the mental stage,
and was more of a marketing myth than anything else. 
</p><p>
First, consider that the cost of higher performance <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym> 
as a factor.  If Sun packaged a high-performance <acronym class="acronym">CPU</acronym> into 
a <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;, the low-cost advantage of an 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> goes away.
</p><p>
Next, Sun did have their <span class="hardware">PicoJava chip</span> available to 
decode <span class="application">Java bytecode</span>, but rumor is the performance 
was not as good as expected, and the complete <span class="hardware">JavaChip</span> 
project was shelved in the Summer of 1998, not long after <span class="productname">Krups
</span>&#8482; was formally released. 

</p><p>
The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Dover</span>&#8221;</span> project was being worked on, but the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Corona
</span>&#8221;</span> project, which would go on to become the <span class="productname">Sun Ray
</span>&#8482;, was the final nail in the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
's coffin.
</p><p>
So all indications are that this model is a piece of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">vaporware</span>&#8221;</span>.  
It is included here though, for the sake of completeness.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="JavaStationProtoDescSection"></a>2.3.7. 
The Pre-Mr. Coffee JavaStation Prototype
</h4></div></div></div><p>
After the original publishing of this HOWTO, word of one more 
"JavaStation" model surfaced.  John Bodo, a reseller 
of JavaStation equipment, chimed in that he has a motherboard of a 
pre-JavaStation machine.  It was made by Diba Corporation, which was 
later bought out by Sun.  The unit was released as an early embededded 
Java platform that developers could use to build embedded Java machines. 
It has a Motorola 68030 CPU, 14.4k bps modem, ethernet interface, 
standard VGA interface and even a TV output.  The prototype's date is
circa 1996.
</p><p>

The Pre-Mr. Coffee JavaStation/Fox
</h4></div></div></div><p>
After receiving word of the JavaStation prototype from Diba, yet
more information has come regarding another pre-Mr. Coffee model.
This one though, has a greater known history we can share here.
</p><p>
This model was the JavaStation development box used by the developers
of early JavaStation software.  Basically it was a SS4/110 in a smaller,
custom case similar to the Mr. Coffee enclosure, with more squarish profile.  
</p><p>
The case has an off-white color with lateral stripe in Sun gray.  It
sits like a Mr. Coffee would on its side.  The front was a 1/2 cyclinder i
design in Sun  gray, has the Sun Logo, the word "Sun" under that, and the 
Java cup logo at the bottom.  
</p><p>
When booting up it claims to be a "JavaStation/Fox".  The motherboard 
does not have a normal Sun part number.  The CPU is a microSPARC-II running
at 110MHz.  The box has an onboard external SCSI connector,
dual A and B serial ports, audio in and out sound ports (Crystal 
Semiconductor 4231, 
lance ethernet network interface, onboard PCMCIA (stp4020), one SBUS expansion
slot, one AFXbus expansion slot, 2 72-pin SIMM slots (double-banked SIMMs
only), and no on-board video.  One would then add their own S-Bus frame 
buffer, or the 24-bit frame buffer from a ss5.  Also, an optional internal 
SCSI laptop hard drive could be put in.
</p><p>
The motherboard's part number is 501-2785.  The CPU is dated 1995 while the
NCR chips are dated 1994, establishing the time frame of the Fox.
</p><p>
The NetBSD/SPARC FAQ has a few more words on the Fox at:

</acronym> Myths Dispelled</h3></div></div></div><p>
It turns out that <span class="application">Linux</span> makes the 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; perform more than adequately
on the desktop.  Thanks to the dedicated work of the Linux 
developer community, the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;
offer users the low-cost, zero-admin, versatile desktop 
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym>'s they were originally billed to be, but with 
the added freedom granted by the <span class="application">Linux OS</span>.
</p><p>
While low-cost <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s now eclipse the <span class="productname">JavaStation
</span>&#8482; in terms of default CPU speed and RAM size, the 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; running <span class="application">Linux</span> are still well-suited for a number of tasks:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Diskless X-Terminal.  (Gives the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; the 
capability of the <span class="productname">Sun Xterminal 1</span>&#8482; hardware that 
they replaced).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> solution, Linux-style: local X + a java-capable 
browser can make the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;
perform like they did with <span class="application">JavaOS</span>/<span class="application">
HotJava</span>, only <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> times faster.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
A beowulf node, or a dedicated <span class="application">RC5</span>/<span class="application">
SETI@HOME</span> client. The <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
running <span class="application">Linux</span> makes a stable, long-lasting 
number cruncher.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
A small, standalone machine.  While a task more suited on today's 
low-cost machines, there's not much that prevents the <span class="productname">
JavaStation</span>&#8482; from performing as a full-fleged 
standalone <span class="application">UNIX</span> machine by itself.  
Just remember to set your expectations appropriately when doing so;
they were <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">low-budget</span>&#8221;</span> clients when they were sold, and
should not be directly compared to today's workstation offerings.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
A small router and server, particularly with the <span class="productname">Espresso
</span>&#8482; model decked out with added IDE disks and NIC.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In all of the above scenarios, there is little to no maintenance of
the machine once configured properly.  Such is the advantage of the
<acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> hardware.  
</p><p>
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; run so much better with 
<span class="application">Linux</span> than <span class="application">JavaOS</span>, 
one would think that even Sun should have offered it as an option.   
Unfortunately, Sun had killed the line in favor of the <span class="productname">Sun Ray
</span>&#8482;.  While the performance of the <span class="productname">Sun Ray
</span>&#8482; is good, keep in mind it is not intended as a dedicated 
computing device, and due to its firmware is little more than a graphics 
display hanging off your Sun server, which can give you some unexpected 
bonus features (translation: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">brand-name product lock</span>&#8221;</span>).  
The performance on 
the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; with <span class="application">Linux
</span> will be similar to what you can get with a <span class="productname">Sun 
Ray</span>&#8482;, but if ever you want to do something different with 
your machines, you have the flexibility to do so with the 
<span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;.  There was rumor of work to try 
and override the default behavior of the SunRay firmware, and make
it into an adjustable computing device, but until that happens, running 
another OS on a SunRay is just a pipe-dream.
</p><p>
Lastly, if you're thinking of switching to <span class="hardware">diskless Xterminals
</span> on your network, you might consider the <span class="productname">JavaStations 
</span>&#8482; over stripped down <acronym class="acronym">PC</acronym>'s.  The hardware 
is standardized, smaller, and you do not need to worry about burning boot 
<acronym class="acronym">PROM</acronym>s and the like.

Sun's official stance is that the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482; 
line was terminated in favor of the new <span class="productname">Sun Ray</span>&#8482; 
line.  A trip to the former <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;

)
</p><p>
As the <span class="productname">Sun Ray</span>&#8482; is not an <acronym class="acronym">NC</acronym> 
in the traditional sense (it has a MicroSparc IIep CPU, but the firmware
on the device prevents anyone from grasping it), there is no explanation why 
the two products could not co-exist.
</p><p>
In talking to the users of the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482;
in the pre-Linux era, you will find strong opinions as to why 
the <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; are no more.  The common 
thread in almost all opinions collected is that the software provided 
by Sun was inadequete for a production environment.  Here are 
collected opinions from users of the Sun-provided software, included 
with their permission:

I only used the Java Stations last summer while teaching 51 and 55/154.  
GoJoe was incredibly slow and I seem to remember having to login to several 
different screens and browsers just to be able to start anything.
</p><p>
I had to apologize to my students for the slow and inconvenient 
machines --- I remember making some jokes about technological progress.

Well, of course the old JavaStations were practically
unusable.  It's not a matter of just my opinion; we used to
have CU 310 full of students using the Xterms all the time.
As soon as the JavaStations appeared there were NO STUDENTS
in there at all.  The JavaStations killed CU 310.  Now that
the JavaStations are (thanks to you) back up to speed,
students are beginning to come back, but they've gotten out
of the habit of working in our lab, and are used to working
on their own in the dorms.  I think this is a big loss --
they don't learn anything from talking to each other in the
labs anymore.
</p><p>
Ghostview was slow, etc, but even vi was too slow.  I am
used to typing quickly, and when the cursor can't keep up
with me, I can't handle it.  I would also have worked at home
if I didn't have to be here.  And there were those annoying
red squares left all over the Xterm window when you were in
vi.  I had to type ^L every few lines to get rid of them to
see what I was typing...  The pits.  The whole setup made
me lose a lot of respect for Sun (although I try to separate
the different product lines as much as possible);  I also
think Sun will not get respect for hyping a product like the
JavaStation so strongly, and then just dumping it.  I would
wonder why anyone would not just dump Sun...
</p><p>
BTW, the JavaStations, now that they are fast, are quite fine.
I really like mine, and don't see why they aren't a viable
product.

I believe that it was the triple combination of Sun's JavaOS, the 
Hotjava software, and GraphOn's GoJoe X-connectivity software which 
ultimately doomed the JavaStation line. 
</p><p>
JavaOS was always sluggish in performance for us.  It was rated as
having one of the slowest Java VMs by a ZDNet Online Magazane review at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/jfgr10.htm" target="_top">
http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/features/javaguide/hfgr10.htm</a>
.  I speculate this was the main cause of delaying the 
JavaStation's formal public release to April 1998.   
</p><p>
(fair use archive copy of the PC mag review at:
<a class="ulink" href="http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/texts/pcmag_js_jvm_review.txt" target="_top">
http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/texts/pcmag_js_jvm_review.txt
</a>
)
</p><p>
JavaOS also always lagged behind the current Java developer 
spec (ie running Java 1.0 when Java 1.1 was prevalent, and Java 1.1 
when Java 1.2 was issued).  It was tough explaining to students why
the books they were buying were all using the new event-model of Java 1.1,
but they could not program to it and have it run on <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">the Java machine
</span>&#8221;</span>.  There were also some implementation problems with some of the 
AWT peers which sometimes made programming across platforms difficult.
</p><p>
These performance and implementation problems were never addressed in 
subsequent build of JavaOS for the duration we ran it.  I believe the 
last edition we had used a Java 1.1.4 runtime, when we had a Java 1.2
development kit on the server.
</p><p>
The HotJava browser software suffered from not being able to handle 
web standards HTML4, cascading style-sheets, or the ECMA javascript.
All of these standards were employed in commercial sites at the time, 
resulting in many sites that weren't viewable by the JavaStations.  
The Hotjava Browser engine also had serious printing problems with 
certain webpages, some of which appeared on Sun's own website!
</p><p>
The HotJava Views task selector software also was rough.  Users could have
multiple apps running, but only one displayed at a time.  Manipulation 
of multiple window panes was difficult (no minimization, no quick list to
all apps, resizing not always possible).  Flexibility users had grown
accustomed to was tossed out in favor of this task-selector approach.
On Sun's Java website there was a page boasting of a committee formed
that decided this was the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">right way</span>&#8221;</span> to make a desktop.
Tell that to our users.
</p><p>
The GraphOn Go-Joe software was by far the most damaging piece of software
to the JavaStation line.  This was an X-connectivity software Sun licensed
from GraphOn to give users access to the Solaris servers' X apps.  
The connectivity worked via a daemon installed on the Solaris server, 
which was connected to by a Java connectivity applet on the NC side.  This 
small applet (only about 250K) simply threw up the latest display state 
and sent back to the daemon the mouse and keyboard strokes of the user.  
Unlike Xterminals though, the actual Xserver process was spawned and 
communicated with on the remote server-side by the daemon.  Communication 
between the GraphOn client applet and the server daemon was supposedly 
done by a patented protocol to compress communication and speed things up.
However, the performance of X under Go-Joe was terribly sluggish, with 
horrible refresh rates (10-seconds for some page scroll refreshes).  
Many sites operators I spoke to elected to not run the Go-Joe software 
past a trial period for this reason.  We had to run it though, as our 
users were heavily X dependant.  Alternatives like Weird/X were not 
available at this time, and VNC proved not up to snuff given the slow 
JavaOS VM.
</p><p>
This performance in Go-Joe alone was enough to give uninformed users the
impression that the JavaStation was an underpowered machine, especially 
when placed side-by-side with the low-cost, end-of-lifed Sun Xterminal 1 
hardware it was meant to replace.  Our students left labs in droves, 
faculty were upset, and giving demos to outsiders was downright 
embarrassing.  In reality the hardware was solid and stable, but 
was hampered by this new, untested OS and new, untested applications 
running on a new, untested hardware architecture.   This triple-threat 
combination, and Sun's timeline for fixing the problems is what 
I feel truly doomed the JavaStation.
</p><p>
I remember that in 1998, Sun publicized that it had rolled out 3000 
of these machines in-house, including one on Scott McNealy's desk.  
One who has used the JavaStations with the Sun software would have 
to wonder whether he ever turned it on and used it solely for a day?  
Had he done so, I'm sure he'd demand things be done differently.  
(update Oct. 2001:  many ex-Sun employees who've contacted me say they
made great doorstops and paper weights.)
</p><p>
Why Sun never ported and released its tried and tested XTerminal 
software to the JavaStation, or even a mini-Solaris, remained a 
mystery to us the whole time before we switched to Linux.  It was
only after we moved to Linux and the JavaStation line was formally killed
by Sun when we learned from some inside Sun sources that Solaris 
actually was ported to Mr. Coffee, but released only internally at Sun.  
As a heavily invested customer site who had begged for help, this was 
not only disheartening, but insulting to discover.
</p><p>
Lastly, the customer support we received at the time was horrible.  We pled
our case on more than a few occassions, but requests always seemed to
fall on deaf ears.  Calling up SunSolve for JavaStation help always
resulted in a transfer to a Java <span class="emphasis"><em>Language</em></span> engineer.  
If the Sun employees do not know their own products, that's a problem!
</p><p>
&gt;From our view, there no doubt was politics involved in this, and as
customers, we were the ones to bear the results of this.
We continue using Sun equipment when it comes to the proven models 
like the Enterprise-class servers and disk arrays, but on the 
latest low-cost desktop offerings, we will be forever cautious 
given the JavaStation history.
</p><p>
Linux now proves the JavaStations are adequate machines, and Sun could 
take this bait and go with it.  If they sell the JavaStations for $250 
a piece and the JavaStation running a proven OS like Linux (or Solaris) 
with proven apps (X), the JavaStation makes for a great network appliance.  
The recent NetPliance I-Opener Linux hack and subsequent controversy 
proves there certainly is a market for this type of low-cost device.
(Oct. 2001 addition: After the publishing of the Linux hack, NetPliance made 
their new hardware unhackable, and subsequently ran out of business.  The
demand for cheap diskless stations still exist.   Today's hackable units
are set-top receivers and failed internet toasters like the 3Com Audrey)

More comments and rebuttal statements by Sun employees are always welcome.
</p><p>
(update Oct 2001): A year and a half of this document's existance and not
a single rebuttal statement by Sun.  There were a couple initial requests 
to omit this section, but I refused.  After all, imagine a new reader 
who never saw a JavaStation before: They'd read to this section, think
"Wow, what a great little machine..let me get one!", and then ask
themselves, "If it did all this, why don't they make them anymore?".
The bad must be included with the good, and to leave this section out
is a disservice to all the users who suffered through the poor software
and support during the official lifetime of the JavaStation.  This section,
therefore, is a necessity, and although this document is licensed under the 
GNU Free Documentation License, the eagle-eyed reader will note that this 
section has been labeled as "invariant" to protect it from entities
who may wish to bury it (which is precisely the reason why the Invariant
clause of the GFDL exists).

Since Sun has canceled production of the <span class="productname">JavaStation</span>&#8482;
line, it no longer sells them through their official channels.  Sun
contacts have informed me that all internal JavaStation stock
was cleaned out and dumped in 2000.  Therefore, All JavaStations are 
now found out in the wild.
</p><p>
Your best bet to get <span class="productname">JavaStations</span>&#8482; though is 
out on the open market.  Educational institutions which received a 
handful from Sun as demo units are now trying to offload them any way 
they can (too bad they don't read this HOWTO).  Search around the 
auction sites like Ebay and Yahoo Auctions, and you should be able 
to turn some up.

Ebay may now be your best bet.
</p><p>
Mr. Coffee is the most widespread JavaStation model, and has tended
to sell around $30-80US consistently for the last year or so.  
</p><p>
Krups models more rare and sell at higher prices, probably because the 
stylish case still stands out today.  Prices on Ebay are always over
$100, but for Oct. 2001, their technology is definitely no longer worth 
that much.  A good price would be $80-85US.   Many reports have come from 
the UK telling of many Krups models getting dumped there.  
</p><p>
The Dover models were a very hush-hush thing when this HOWTO was initially
published, but the secret is out: if you want one, go to South Africa.  
Dovers seemed to have been dumped there en masse.  Pricing is unknown,
but should be comparable to a Cyrix-266 PC clone.
</p><p>
The Espresso and JavaEngine models are near impossible to find,
so if you get one, consider yourself lucky.  If you have a Fox,
well, you're just too cool.  Pricing for these models is likely a
premium. (&gt;$100US).
