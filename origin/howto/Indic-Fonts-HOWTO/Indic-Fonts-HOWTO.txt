1. Introduction

This HOWTO has been written to help you setup your Linux box to use UTF-
8 encoding for using various Indic scripts. You will have to install the IndiX
system developed by NCST, Mumbai on your machine in order for you to use
various Indic scripts. I have tested the IndiX system on Exodus GNU/Linux,
RedHat Linux, and Mandrake Linux. Anyone who has tested this system on a
machine running Debian, please let me know and I will include that in this
HOWTO. I want to thank Mr. Keyur Shroff from NCST, Mumbai for allowing me to
modify and redistribute his Devanagri-HOWTO.
Please note that Exodus GNU/Linux, developed by the good guys at Centurion
Linux, India will ship with the IndiX system installed, thanks to the Transfer
of Technology deal signed by NCST, Mumbai and Centurion Linux Pvt. Ltd.
Almost all of the leading GNU/Linux distributions available today have been
localized in various international languages like French, German, Spanish,
Chinese, Arabic, etc. This HOWTO aims at documenting the steps involved in
enabling you to localize your GNU/Linux distribution to Indic scripts of your
choice. To begin with, you must be aware of the complexity involved in
localizing any of the Indian languages. Any Indian language text input differs
from that of English. Perhaps the most significant difference is that in
English, each keystroke maps directly onto a letter where each letter has a
unique code. On the other hand, a 'syllable' - the Indian language equivalent
unit of writing letter is composed of one or more characters entered through
the keyboard.
The syllable is composed of vowels, consonants, modifiers and other special
graphics signs. These are encoded, just as roman letters are. The user types in
a sequence of vowels, consonants, modifiers and the graphics signs. The machine
then composes these syllables at run time based on language dependent rules.
Every syllable is thus represented in the machine as a unique sequence of
vowels, consonants and modifiers. In a text sequence, these characters are
stored in logical (phonetic) order.
Indic characters can combine or change shape depending on their context. A
character's appearance is affected by its ordering with respect to other
characters, the font used to render the character, and the application or
system environment. These variables can cause the appearance of Devanagari
characters to be different from their nominal glyphs (used in the code charts).
Additionally, characters cause a change in the order of the displayed glyphs.
This reordering is not commonly seen in non-Indic scripts and occurs
independent of any bi-directional character reordering that might be required.
Each syllable has a unique visual representation. However, there are too many
syllables to design glyphs for each one individually. So a font normally
contains certain component glyphs from which a syllable is composed at run
time. The onscreen representation of a syllable is then a composition of glyphs
from the Indian language font. There is no direct mapping of glyph codes to the
consonant, vowel or modifier codes. However, for every syllable (a sequence of
consonants, vowels and modifiers) there is a corresponding sequence of glyphs.
This constitutes a many-to-many mapping from keystrokes to glyphs as opposed to
a simplistic one-to-one mapping in roman scripts.
Please read the Unicode-HOWTO and visit http://www.unicode.org/ for more
information on the UTF-8 encoding.
The Indix system developed by NCST, Mumbai enables most applications in X
Windows (irrespective of the toolkit used), to render Indic characters
according to the unicode standard specification. IndiX provides support for
OpenType fonts and Unicode encoding at X Windows level. This enables most of
the existing applications to handle Indic scripts without any modification or
recompilation.
Once you have installed the IndiX system, following all the steps mentioned in
this HOWTO, you will be able to fly across seven seas and slap that annoying
sailor who keeps goin' hic' hic'... Okay, on a more serious note, you will be
able to enjoy your Linux experience in Devanagri and other Indic scripts of
your choice.

2. Installing the IndiX system

You can obtain the IndiX system from NCST, Mumbai site http://
rohini.ncst.ernet.in/indix/. The system is available in its source as well as
binary form. This HOWTO covers the installation of the IndiX system using the
binary files avaiable for download. At a later stage, I plan to cover the
source installation of IndiX on your box, too. You need to download the
following files in order to install IndiX sucessfully onto your machine:

gtk.tar.gz
indix.tar.gz


2.1. Installing IndiX

NCST has written Simpm ( Simple Package Manager ) that takes care of the entire
installation process on your system. Simpm carries out the following steps for
a binary distribution of the IndiX system:

  1. It reads the names of the files within the distribution by essentially
     running the command tar -tzpPf package.tgz > .package.list
  2. It saves all these files and the file containing the list using the
     command tar -czpPf .old.package.tgz .package.list `cat .package.list`
  3. Simpm then extracts the files from the package and installs them using tar
     -xzpPf package.tgz

Should you wish to go back to the old system state for any reason, you can
easily do so using tar -xzpPf .old.package.tgz

2.2. Running Simpm

simpm with no arguments/parameters will display its usage.

    # simpm -i package.tgz [-d savdir/]

does all the above steps, 1 through 3. The 'i' flag indicates install.
Successful installation will create savdir/.old.package.tgz. If it finds an
existing .old.package.tgz, simpm will not proceed as it means that the IndiX
system has already been installed earlier. However, you can force an IndiX
install by renaming it to a newpackage. Alternatively, you can uninstall the
package and install it again.

    # simpm -u package.tgz [-d savdir/]

uninstalls the package. Note, however, that this command will work only if it
finds a readable .old.package.tgz. Having uninstalled the package, simpm will
restore the original files that were overwritten by the package. The
.old.package.tgz will be deleted after the uninstallation so that all instances
of the previous installation are removed. Simpm maintains a log of all installs
and uninstalls in the savdir/simpm.log file.
To install the IndiX system, all you have to do is (pray and do your favourite
tribal dance) type in the following commands:

    # simpm -i /path/to/gtk.tar.gz
    # simpm -i /path/to/indix.tar.gz

and all the necessary files will be backed up, and the IndiX system installed
on your machine. Hurrah.
Congratulations, o' most precious one, on having installed IndiX system on your
machine. The remainder of this HOWTO will focus on setting up your Linux
environment to support Indic fonts and scripts in X.

3. Devanagri Input and Output setup


3.1. Linux console

Devanagari characters do not display properly in a Linux console. However, NCST
has developed ncst-term (a terminal emulator program in X Window System) which
has support for converting keystrokes to UTF-8 before sending them to the
application running in the ncst-term, and for displaying Unicode characters
that the application outputs as UTF-8 byte sequence.

3.2. X Window System

You need to make some changes in your XF86Config-4 file (usually resides in /
etc/X11/ directory). A sample config file XF86Config-4.indix is installed along
with IndiX system. This file can be found in /etc/X11/ directory.

3.2.1. Devanagri Font

OpenType is the most suitable font format to render any Indic script properly.
The IndiX system ships with one OpenType font called "raghu" for Hindi. Anyone
can use and distribute this font free-of-cost. You can find this font in /usr/
X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/ directory.
Installing the Indic Fonts:
In order to install the Indic fonts, you must log in as root. The X Font Server
(xfs) is known to have some problems with the IndiX system, so remove it from
the FontPath of the X Server. This can be achieved by modifying your
XF86Config-4 file (usually in /etc/X11/) and commenting the line in the Files
section and adding /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/ to the current FontPath.
After that, the FontPath should look something similar to this:

    FontPath   "unix/:7100"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"

Next, in order to make use of the OpenType font you have, load the "freetype"
module at startup. You can achieve this by adding the following line in the
Module section of XF86Config-4 file.

    Load "freetype"

Make sure you specify the modules search path in the Files section, too.

    ModulePath "/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/fonts"
    ModulePath "/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers"
    ModulePath "/usr/X11R6/lib/modules"
    ModulePath "/usr/X11R6/lib"
    ModulePath "/usr/lib"

Any new Indic fonts you want to install should be placed in the /usr/X11R6/lib/
X11/fonts/TrueType/ directory. Now, change to this directory and run the
following commands:

    $ mkfontdir
    $ xset fp rehash

In case you want to place your new Indic fonts in some other directory, you
must use xset to add the new FontPath. Please see the xset man-page for further
assistance. You can check the new installed fonts by running the xlsfonts
command. In case you don't see any Indic fonts using this command, you may need
to restart X.

3.2.2. Devanagri Keyboard Layout

The IndiX system comes with a keyboard map file for xmodmap. You can use the
utility xmodmap to map a Devanagri keyboard. For most distributions, when you
start X, the X-Server will look for a Xmodmap in /etc/X11/ directory. If that
file does not exist, the server will look for a .Xmodmap in your $HOME. Just
putting the .Xmodmap in your $HOME will be okay. When you start the X server,
it will load this file. You can also load .Xmodmap from the command line:

    $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap


Note

If you are using XFree86 version 4.0 or later, you need to add the line
XkbDisable in InputDevice section of XF86Config-4 file. You may config the
keyboard section like the following sample.

    Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "keyboard"
    Option      "XkbDisable"
    EndSection


4. Locale Setup


4.1. Files and the kernel

You can now use any Unicode characters in file names. No kernel or file
utilities need modifications. This is because file names in the kernel can be
anything not containing a null byte, and '/' is used to delimit subdirectories.
When encoded using UTF-8, non-ASCII characters will never be encoded using null
bytes or slashes. All that happens is that file and directory names occupy more
bytes than they contain characters. For example, a filename consisting of five
greek characters will appear to the kernel as a 10-byte filename. The kernel
does not know (and does not need to know) that these bytes are displayed as
greek.
This is the general theory, so long as your files reside on Linux. On
filesystems which are used from other operating systems, you have mount options
to control conversion of filenames to or from UTF-8:

* The "vfat" filesystems has a mount option "utf8". See file /usr/src/linux/
  Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt. When you give an "iocharset" mount option
  different from the default (which is "iso8859-1"), the results with and
  without "utf8" are not consistent. Therefore, it is not I recommend to use
  the "iocharset" mount option.
* The "msdos", "umsdos" filesystems have the same mount option, but appear to
  have no effect.
* The "iso9660" filesystem has a mount option "utf8". See file /usr/src/linux/
  Documentation/filesystems/isofs.txt.
* Since Linux 2.2.x kernels, the "ntfs" filesystem has a mount option "utf8".
  See file /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt.

The other filesystems (nfs, smbfs, ncpfs, hpfs, etc.) don't convert filenames;
therefore they support Unicode file names in UTF-8 encoding only if the other
operating system supports them. Please note that to enable a mount option for
all future remounts, you add it to the fourth column of the corresponding /etc/
fstab line.

4.2. Locale environment variables

You should have the following environment variables set, containing locale
names:


  LANGUAGE
      override for LC_MESSAGES

  LC_ALL
      override for all other LC_* variables

  LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_COLLATE, LC_NUMERIC, LC_MONETARY, LC_TIME
      individual variables for: character types and encoding, natural language
      messages, sorting rules, number formatting, money amount formatting, date
      and time display.

  LANG
      default value for all LC_* variables. (See `man 7 locale' for a detailed
      description.)

In order to tell your system and all applications that you are using UTF-8, you
need to add a codeset suffix of UTF-8 to your locale names. For example, if you
want to run an application in UTF-8 Hindi locale then with bash shell, you can
specify which environment variable to be passed to the application.

    $ LANG=hi_IN.UTF-8 xman

In order to set locale the Hindi locale globally for a particular user, you can
append the following line in ~/.bashrc file.

    export LANG=hi_IN.UTF-8

After that you need not to set the LANG environment variable each time you run
a specific application.

5. Applications with Devanagri


5.1. Browsers


5.1.1. Netscape Navigator

Netscape 6.01 or later can display HTML documents in UTF-8 encoding. All a
document needs is the following line between the <head> and </head> tags:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

To setup Netscape so that it displays Hindi characters:

Goto, Edit -> Preferences
Select category, Appearance -> Fonts
Select Language encoding "Unicode"
Set Variable-width and Fixed-width fonts to "raghu"
Check button "Always use my font settings, overriding web page font"

Also, ensure that the character coding scheme is set to UTF-8

Goto, View -> Character Coding
Select "Unicode (UTF-8)" from the list


5.1.2. Konqueror

Konqueror has good support for Unicode. To setup konqueror so that it displays
Hindi characters:

Goto, Settings -> Configure Konqueror
Select "Konqueror Bowser" from the left pan
Goto "Appearance" tab on the right pan
Select charset "iso106460-1"
Set all fonts to "raghu" for this encoding and also set Default encoding to
"utf8"


5.2. Editors


5.2.1. yudit

yudit by Gáspár Sinai (http://czyborra.com/yudit/) is an excellent unicode text
editor for the X Window System. It supports simultaneous processing of many
languages, input methods, conversions for local character standards etc. It has
facilities for entering text in all languages with only an English keyboard,
using keyboard configuration maps. Customization is very easy. Typically you
will first want to customize your font. From the font menu, choose "Unicode".
Next, you should customize your input method. The input methods "Straight",
"Unicode" and "SGML" are most remarkable. For details about the other built-in
input methods, look in /usr/local/share/yudit/data/. To make a change the
default for the next session, edit your $HOME/.yuditrc file. The general editor
functionality is limited to editing, cut and paste and search and replace.
There is no provision for an undo. yudit can display text using a TrueType
font. But it doesn't seem to support combining characters.

5.2.2. Vim

Vim (as of version 6.0) has good support for UTF-8. When started in an UTF-
8 locale, it assumes UTF-8 encoding for the console and the text files being
edited. It supports double-wide (CJK) characters as well and combining
characters and therefore fits perfectly into UTF-8 enabled ncst-term.

5.2.3. gedit

gedit is an editor developed using GtkText widget. gedit-0.9.0 does not support
FontSet. This means that you can't edit both English and Hindi text
simultaneously. But if you choose a proper font then you will be able to use
any one language at a time.

5.2.4. xedit

With XFree86-4.0.1, xedit is capable of editing UTF-8 files if your locale is
set appropriately. Add the line

    "Xedit*international: true"

to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file.

5.3. Mailers

Mail clients released after January 1, 1999, should be capable of sending and
displaying UTF-8 encoded mails, otherwise they are considered deficient. But
these mails have to carry the MIME labels:

    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Simply piping an UTF-8 file into "mail" without caring about the MIME labels
will not work. Mail client implementors should take a look at http://
www.imc.org/imc-intl/ and http://www.imc.org/mail-i18n.html.
Now about some of the individual mail clients (or "mail user agents"):

5.3.1. kmail

kmail (as of KDE 1.0) does not support UTF-8 mails at all.

5.3.2. Netscape Mail

Netscape Mail can send and display mails in UTF-8 encoding, but it needs a
little bit of manual user intervention. To send an UTF-8 encoded mail:

  1. After opening the "Mail" window, but before starting to compose the
     message, select from the menu "View -> Character Coding -> Unicode (UTF-
     8)".
  2. Then compose the message and send it.

When you receive an UTF-8 encoded mail, Netscape does not display it in UTF-
8 right away, and does not even give a visual clue that the mail was encoded in
UTF-8. You have to manually select from the menu View -> Character Coding -
> Unicode (UTF-8).
For displaying UTF-8 mails, Netscape uses different fonts. You can adjust your
font settings in the Edit -> Preferences -> Fonts dialog by selecting the
"Unicode" font category.

5.3.3. exmh

exmh 2.1.2 with Tk 8.4a1 can recognize and correctly display UTF-8 mails if you
add the following lines to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file.

    !
    ! Exmh
    !
    exmh.mimeUCharsets: utf-8
    exmh.mime_utf-8_registry: iso10646
    exmh.mime_utf-8_encoding: 1
    exmh.mime_utf-8_plain_families: fixed
    exmh.mime_utf-8_fixed_families: fixed
    exmh.mime_utf-8_proportional_families: fixed
    exmh.mime_utf-8_title_families: fixed

  7.4. Why_are_some_of_the_pixels_in_Hindi_characters_distorted?

  7.5. All_Hindi_characters_are_displayed,_but_why_are_they_not_rendered
  properly?

  7.6. Why_can't_I_download_ISO_images_of_Exodus_GNU/Linux™,_yet?


7.1. I can't start the X windows system. It gives an error "Could not open
     default Indic font 'xyz'".
     Please make sure that the font 'xyz' is correctly installed and is in the
     current FontPath. The Indic fonts usually reside in the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/
     fonts/TrueType/ directory. Your FontPath is defined in the /etc/X11/
     XFree86Config-4 file. To learn more about howto specify your FontPath, read
     the section on X Window System (3.2) in this HOWTO.
7.2. Can I use any other font as the default system font instead of the raghu
     font shipped with the IndiX system?
     You can load an Indic script font by giving command line server option while
     starting X Window System. e.g.

         $ startx -- -devanagari "my_devanagari_font"

     or

         $ startx -- -tamil "my_tamil_font"

     Here, "my_devanagari_font" and "my_tamil_font" should be replaced by the
     font name that you want to load. You can either specify alias name or full
     XLFD name for the font. However alias name must be there in fonts.alias file
     and XLFD name in fonts.dir file.
7.3. I have installed IndiX system but it doesn't show Hindi characters. Why?
     This could possibly be due to the fact that your Hindi locale has not been
     setup correctly. To change/set the locale you should set LANG environment
     variable. Append the line

         export LANG=hi_IN.UTF-8

     in your ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile files. Restart your terminal emulator
     program and run the application. After this the application should display
     Hindi characters.
7.4. Why are some of the pixels in Hindi characters distorted?
     This is probably because the X Font Server (xfs) is running and is still in
     the current FontPath. You can either shutdown the X Font Server or remove it
     from the current FontPath. To shutdown xfs issue the following command after
     becoming root:

         # /etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs stop

     To remove xfs from the current FontPath, read the section Section 3.2,_“X
     Window_System” in this HOWTO.
7.5. All Hindi characters are displayed, but why are they not rendered properly?
     IndiX system uses an OpenType font to render Indic script characters, as it
     is the most suitable font format for Indic scripts. If you use some other
     kind of font, for example a TrueType font or a Bitmap font, then the font
     does not have enough information that is required to render Indic script
     text properly. So it is recommended to use only OpenType fonts for Indic
     scripts. Also, in case you are already using an OpenType font, please update
     your glibc.
7.6. Why can't I download ISO images of Exodus GNU/Linux™, yet?
     The good guys at Centurion Linux are looking for sponsors who can take care
     of their hosting needs. If you are interested in helping Centurion Linux
     out, please contact me on <bali@centurionlinux.com>.

legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
 The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary_Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
 The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.
 A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
“Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.
 The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.

3. 2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section_3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.

4. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover_Texts, you must enclose the copies in
covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with
each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the
Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has
access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
provide you with an updated version of the Document.

5. 4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified_Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:

* A.  Use in the Title_Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
  that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
  there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
  use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
  version gives permission.
* B.  List on the Title_Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
  responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified_Version,
  together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of
  its principal authors, if it has less than five).
* C.  State on the Title_Page the name of the publisher of the Modified
  Version, as the publisher.
* D.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
* E.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
  the other copyright notices.
* F.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
  the public permission to use the Modified_Version under the terms of this
  License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
* G.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant_Sections and
  required Cover_Texts given in the Document's license notice.
* H.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.
* I.  Preserve the section entitled “History”, and its title, and add to it an
  item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
  Modified_Versionas given on the Title_Page. If there is no section entitled
  “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
  publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
  describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
* J.  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
  access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
  locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These
  may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit a network location for a
  work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
  the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K.  In any section entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, preserve the
  section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
  each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
* L.  Preserve all the Invariant_Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
  text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
  considered part of the section titles.
* M.  Delete any section entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be
  included in the Modified_Version.
* N.  Do not retitle any existing section as “Endorsements” or to conflict in
  title with any Invariant_Section.

If the Modified_Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary_Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant_Sections in the Modified
Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
titles.
You may add a section entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but
endorsements of your Modified_Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover_Text, and a passage
of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover_Text, to the end of the list of Cover_Texts
in the Modified_Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-
Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If
the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified_Version.

6. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
under the terms defined in section_4 above for modified versions, provided that
you include in the combination all of the Invariant_Sections of all of the
original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
combined work in its license notice.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant_Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled “History” in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled “History”; likewise
combine any sections entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections entitled
“Dedications”. You must delete all sections entitled “Endorsements.”

7. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and dispbibute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.

8. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified_Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an “aggregate”, and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document , on account of
their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document. If the Cover_Text requirement of section_3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the
entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on
covers around the whole aggregate.

9. 8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section_4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.

10. 9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

11. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free_Software_Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free
Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any
later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

12. Addendum

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:

     Copyright ℗ YEAR YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or
     any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with the
     Invariant_Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
     Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover_Texts being LIST. A copy of
     the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free
     Documentation License”.

If you have no Invariant_Sections, write “with no Invariant Sections” instead
of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover_Texts, write “no
Front-Cover Texts” instead of “Front-Cover Texts being LIST”; likewise for
Back-Cover_Texts.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU_General_Public_License, to permit their use in free
software.
