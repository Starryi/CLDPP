<EM>    This article is intended to help you to start programming
    basic-intermediate shell scripts. It does not intend to be an
    advanced document (see the title). I am NOT an expert nor guru
    shell programmer. I decided to write this because I'll learn a
    lot and it might be useful to other people. Any feedback is
    appreciated, especially in the patch or pull request form. :)

<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Getting the latest version</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html">https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html</A></P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Requisites           </A>
</H2>

<P> Familiarity with GNU/Linux command lines, and familiarity
with basic programming concepts is helpful. While this is not
a programming introduction, it explains (or at least tries) many
basic concepts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Uses of this document           </A>
</H2>

<P> This document tries to be useful in the following situations
<UL>
<LI> You have an idea about programming and you want to start
coding some shell scripts.</LI>
<LI> You have a vague idea about shell programming and want
some sort of reference.</LI>
<LI> You want to see some shell scripts and some comments to
start writing your own.</LI>
<LI> You are migrating from DOS/Windows (or already did)
and want to make "batch" processes.</LI>
<LI> You are a complete nerd and read every how-to available.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Very simple Scripts     </A></H2>

<P> This HOW-TO will try to give you some hints about shell script
programming strongly based on examples.</P>
<P> In this section you'll find some little scripts which
will hopefully help you to understand some techniques.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Traditional hello world script                 </A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          #!/bin/bash
          echo Hello World
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> This script has only two lines.
The first indicates the system which program
to use to run the file.</P>
<P> The second line is the only action performed by this script,
which prints 'Hello World' on the terminal.</P>
<P> If you get something like <I>./hello.sh: Command not found.</I>
Probably the first line '#!/bin/bash' is wrong, issue whereis bash or see
'finding bash' to see how should you write this line.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 A very simple backup script         </A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        #!/bin/bash
        tar -cZf /var/my-backup.tgz /home/me/
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> In this script, instead of printing a message on the terminal,
we create a tar-ball of a user's home directory. This is NOT intended
to be used, a more useful backup script is presented later in this
document.</P>
<H2><A NAME="s3">3. All about redirection   </A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Theory and quick reference     </A>
</H2>

<P> There are 3 file descriptors, stdin, stdout and stderr (std=standard).</P>

<P>Basically you can:
<OL>
<LI> redirect stdout to a file</LI>
<LI> redirect stderr to a file</LI>
<LI> redirect stdout to a stderr</LI>
<LI> redirect stderr to a stdout</LI>
<LI> redirect stderr and stdout to a file</LI>
<LI> redirect stderr and stdout to stdout</LI>
<LI> redirect stderr and stdout to stderr</LI>
</OL>

1 'represents' stdout and 2 stderr.</P>
<P> A little note for seeing the output of these commands: with the less
command you can view both stdout (which will remain on the buffer) and the
stderr that will be printed on the screen, but erased as you try to 'browse'
the buffer.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Sample: stdout 2 file  </A>
</H2>

<P> This will cause the output of a program to be written to a file.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ls -l > ls-l.txt
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, a file called 'ls-l.txt' will be created and it will contain what you would see on the
screen if you type the command 'ls -l' and execute it.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Sample: stderr 2 file  </A>
</H2>

<P> This will cause the stderr output of a program to be written to a file.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        grep da * 2> grep-errors.txt
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, a file called 'grep-errors.txt' will be created and it will contain what you would see
the stderr portion of the output of the 'grep da *' command.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Sample: stdout 2 stderr        </A>
</H2>

<P> This will cause the stdout output of a program to be written to the same filedescriptor
as stderr.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        grep da * 1>&amp;2
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, the stdout portion of the command is sent to stderr, you may notice that in different ways.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Sample: stderr 2 stdout        </A>
</H2>

<P> This will cause the stderr output of a program to be written to the same filedescriptor
as stdout.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        grep * 2>&amp;1
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, the stderr portion of the command is sent to stdout, if you pipe to less, you'll see that
lines that normally 'disappear' (as they are written to stderr) are being kept now (because
they're on stdout).</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Sample: stderr and stdout 2 file       </A>
</H2>

<P> This will place every output of a program to a file. This is suitable sometimes
for cron entries, if you want a command to pass in absolute silence.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        rm -f $(find / -name core) &amp;> /dev/null
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This (thinking on the cron entry) will delete every file called 'core' in any directory. Notice
that you should be pretty sure of what a command is doing if you are going to wipe its output.</P>
<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Pipes   </A></H2>

<P> This section explains in a very simple and practical way how to use pipes,
and why you may want to use them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 What they are and why you'll want to use them          </A>
</H2>

<P> Pipes let you use (very simple, I insist) the output of a program as the
input of another one</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Sample: simple pipe with sed   </A>
</H2>

<P> This is very simple way to use pipes.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, the following happens: first the command ls -l is executed, and its output,
instead of being printed, is sent (piped) to the sed program, which in turn, prints
what it has to.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Sample: an alternative to ls -l *.txt  </A>
</H2>

<P> Probably, this is a more difficult way to do ls -l *.txt, but it is here for illustrating pipes,
not for solving such listing dilemma.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ls -l | grep "\.txt$"
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, the output of the program ls -l is sent to the grep program, which, in turn, will print
lines which match the regex "\.txt$".</P>
<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Variables              </A></H2>

<P> You can use variables as in any programming languages.
There are no data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a
character, a string of characters.</P>
<P>  You have no need to declare a variable, just
assigning a value to its reference will create it.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Sample: Hello World! using variables             </A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
            #!/bin/bash
            STR="Hello World!"
            echo $STR
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> Line 2 creates
a variable called STR and assigns the string "Hello World!" to
it. Then the VALUE of this variable is retrieved by putting
the '$' in at the beginning. Please notice (try it!)
that if you don't use the '$' sign, the output of the program will
be different, and probably not what you want it to be.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Sample: A very simple backup script (little bit better)           </A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
           #!/bin/bash
           OF=/var/my-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tgz
           tar -cZf $OF /home/me/
           
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> This script introduces another thing. First
of all, you should be familiarized with the variable
creation and assignation on line 2. Notice the expression
'$(date +%Y%m%d)'.
If you run the script you'll notice that
it runs the
command inside the parenthesis, capturing its output.</P>

<P> Notice that in this script, the output filename will
be different every day, due to the format switch to the date command(+%Y%m%d).
You can change this by specifying a different format.</P>
<P> Some more examples:</P>
<P> echo ls</P>
<P> echo $(ls)</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Local variables        </A>
</H2>

<P> Local variables can be created by using the keyword <I>local</I>.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                #!/bin/bash
                HELLO=Hello
                function hello {
                        local HELLO=World
                        echo $HELLO
                }
                echo $HELLO
                hello
                echo $HELLO
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> This example should be enought to show how to use a local variable.</P>
<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Conditionals     </A></H2>

<P> Conditionals let you decide whether to perform an action
or not, this decision is taken by evaluating an expression.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Dry Theory         </A>
</H2>

<P> Conditionals have many forms. The most basic form is:
<B>if</B> <I>expression</I> <B>then</B> <I>statement</I>
where 'statement' is only executed if 'expression'
evaluates to true.
'2&lt;1' is an expresion that evaluates to false, while '2>1'
evaluates to true.xs</P>
<P> Conditionals have other forms such as:
<B>if</B> <I>expression</I>
<B>then</B> <I>statement1</I> <B>else</B> <I>statement2</I>.
Here 'statement1' is executed  if 'expression' is true,otherwise
'statement2' is executed.</P>
<P> Yet another form of conditionals is:
<B>if</B> <I>expression1</I>
<B>then</B> <I>statement1</I>
<B>else if</B> <I>expression2</I> <B>then</B> <I>statement2</I>
<B>else</B> <I>statement3</I>.
In this form there's added only the
"ELSE IF 'expression2' THEN 'statement2'" which makes statement2 being
executed if expression2 evaluates to true. The rest is as you may
imagine (see previous forms).</P>
<P> A word about syntax:</P>
<P> The base for the 'if' constructions in bash is this:</P>
<P> if [expression];</P>
<P> then</P>
<P>    code if 'expression' is true.</P>
<P> fi</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Sample: Basic conditional example if .. then             </A>

            fi
            
</PRE>

</P>
<P> The code to be executed if the expression within braces
is true can
be found after the 'then' word and before 'fi' which indicates the end
of the conditionally executed code.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Loops for, while and until          </A></H2>

<P> In this section you'll find for, while and until loops.</P>
<P> The <B>for</B> loop is a little bit different from other programming
languages. Basically, it let's you iterate over a series of
'words' within a string.</P>
<P> The <B>while</B> executes a piece of code if the control expression
is true, and only stops when it is false (or a explicit break is found
within the executed code.</P>
<P> The <B>until</B> loop is almost equal to the while loop, except that
the code is executed while the control expression evaluates to false.</P>
<P> If you suspect that while and until are very similar you are right.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 For sample         </A>

        done
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> On the second line, we declare i to be the variable that
will take the
different values contained in $( ls ).</P>
<P> The third line could be longer if needed, or there could
be more lines
before the done (4).</P>
<P> 'done' (4) indicates that the code that used the value of $i has
finished and $i can take a new value.</P>
<P> This script has very little sense, but a more useful way to use the
for loop would be to use it to match only certain files on the previous
example</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 C-like for     </A>

<P> As in almost any programming language, you can use functions to group
pieces of code in a more logical way or practice the divine art of recursion.</P>
<P> Declaring a function is just a matter of writing function my_func { my_code }.</P>
<P> Calling a function is just like calling another program, you just write its name.</P>

<P> If you need to use fractions, or more math or you just want it, you
can use bc to evaluate arithmetic expressions.</P>
<P> If I ran "echo $[3/4]" at the command prompt, it would return 0
because bash  only uses integers when answering. If you  ran
"echo 3/4|bc -l", it would properly return 0.75.</P>

<P> From a message from mike (see Thanks to)</P>
<P> you always use #!/bin/bash .. you might was to give an example of</P>
<P> how to find where bash is located.</P>
<P> 'locate bash' is preferred, but not all machines have locate.</P>
<P> 'find ./ -name bash' from the root dir will work, usually.</P>
<P> Suggested locations to check:</P>
<P>         ls -l /bin/bash</P>
<P>         ls -l /sbin/bash</P>
<P>         ls -l /usr/local/bin/bash</P>
<P>         ls -l /usr/bin/bash</P>
<P>         ls -l /usr/sbin/bash</P>
<P>         ls -l /usr/local/sbin/bash</P>
<P> (can't think of any other dirs offhand...  i've found it in</P>
<P> most of these places before on different system).</P>
<P> You may try also 'which bash'.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Useful commands          </A>
</H2>

<P> This section was re-written by Kees (see thank to...)</P>
<P>  Some of these commands almost contain complete programming languages.
From those commands only the basics will be explained. For a more detailed
description, have a closer look at the main pages of each command.</P>
<P><B>sed</B> (stream editor)</P>

<P> Sed is a non-interactive editor. Instead of altering a file by moving the
cursor on the screen, you use a script of editing instructions to sed, plus the
name of the file to edit. You can also describe sed as a filter. Let's have
a look at some examples:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $sed 's/to_be_replaced/replaced/g' /tmp/dummy
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> Sed replaces the string 'to_be_replaced' with the string 'replaced' and
reads from the /tmp/dummy file. The result will be sent to stdout (normally
the console) but you can also add '> capture' to the end of the line above so
that sed sends the output to the file 'capture'.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $sed 12, 18d /tmp/dummy
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> Sed shows all lines except lines 12 to 18. The original file is not altered by this command.</P>
<P><B>awk</B> (manipulation of datafiles, text retrieval and processing)</P>

<P> Many implementations of the AWK programming language exist (most known interpreters are GNU's
gawk and 'new awk' mawk.) The principle is simple: AWK scans for a pattern, and for every
matching pattern an action will be performed.</P>
<P> Again, I've created a dummy file containing the following lines:</P>
<P> <I>"test123</I></P>
<P> <I>test</I></P>
<P> <I>tteesstt"</I></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $awk '/test/ {print}' /tmp/dummy
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> test123</P>

<P> test</P>

<P> The pattern AWK looks for is 'test' and the action it performs when it found a line in the file
/tmp/dummy with the string 'test' is 'print'.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $awk '/test/ {i=i+1} END {print i}' /tmp/dummy
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> 3</P>

<P> When you're searching for many patterns, you should replace the text between the quotes with '-f
file.awk' so you can put all patterns and actions in 'file.awk'.</P>
<P><B>grep</B> (print lines matching a search pattern)</P>

<P> We've already seen quite a few grep commands in the previous chapters, that display the lines
matching a pattern. But grep can do more.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $grep "look for this" /var/log/messages -c
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> 12</P>
<P> The string "look for this" has been found 12 times in the file /var/log/messages.</P>

<P> [ok, this example was a fake, the /var/log/messages was tweaked :-)]</P>
<P><B>wc</B> (counts lines, words and bytes)</P>

<P> In the following example, we see that the output is not what we expected. The dummy file, as used
in this example, contains the following text:
<I>"bash introduction</I>
<I> howto test file"</I></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $wc --words --lines --bytes /tmp/dummy
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> 2 5 34 /tmp/dummy</P>

<P> Wc doesn't care about the parameter order. Wc always prints them in a standard order, which is,
as you can see: &lt;lines&gt;&lt;words&gt;&lt;bytes&gt;&lt;filename&gt;.</P>
<P><B>sort</B> (sort lines of text files)</P>

<P> This time the dummy file contains the following text:</P>
<P> <I>"b</I></P>
<P> <I>c</I></P>
<P> <I>a"</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $sort /tmp/dummy
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P> This is what the output looks like:</P>

<P> <I>a</I></P>
<P> <I>b</I></P>
<P> <I>c</I></P>

<P> Commands shouldn't be that easy :-)
<B>bc</B> (a calculator programming language)</P>

<P> Bc is accepting calculations from command line (input from file. not from redirector or pipe),
but also from a user interface. The following demonstration shows some of the commands. Note that</P>
<P> I start bc using the -q parameter to avoid a welcome message.</P>
