>The primary purpose of this document is
      to make the co-existance between Windows and Linux as simple and uncomplex
      as possible which means as far as Windows is concerned Linux doesn't
      exist. It is now possible to install Linux on a Windows partition as a disk
      image with what is known as the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>loopback</SPAN
> filesystem
      &#8211; RedHat and Mandrake offer this &#8211; but it's an extremely bad
      idea because of the way Windows handles files. Defragmenting the system will
      become a nightmare and Linux itself will crawl and it will ruin both your
      Windows and Linux experience. The same applies to the
      <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Umsdos</SPAN
> filesystem (though Linux won't crawl) and
      it's best to install Linux on a partition of its own. This document makes a
      few presumptions but nothing to worry about &#8211; just a few.</P

    </P
><P
>With that out of the way we can begin. The first thing to do is to
      make space for Linux. Like other Linux wannabes you are likely to be stuck
      with a huge single partition with Windows on it. This would be your
      <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
> drive. In my case it was hogging
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>13.5</TT
> gigs. You have to make a separate partition
      for Linux out of this space (which would then be labelled as
      <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>D</I
>). You can either use Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> which really is not a good idea as it
      would entail losing all your data and making new partitions from scratch,
      one for Windows and one for Linux, or you can take the easier and far more
      convenient way out and use a free and excellent non-destructive
      partitioning utility called <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
>. What makes
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> special is its ability to create a new
      partition out of the free space in your <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
>
      partition without any loss of data. The latest version of
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.0</TT
>) is available at
      its homepage <A
HREF="http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/"

>http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/</A

      and most Linux distributions carry it under the 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dostools</TT
> or 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dosutils</TT
> directory in the primary
      cd.</P
><P
>We are going to concentrate on using
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> so if you are going to use Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> &#8211; which actually is totally
      unnecessary unless you have just bought a new system and even then it's a
      better idea to make a single partition with Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN

      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN

      explain later in this document &#8211; or a commercial partition utility

><P
>A hard disk can have a maximum of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>4</TT
> primary
      partitions &#8211; don't ask me why, I don't know. Apart from primary
      partitions a hard disk can also have what is known as an extended partition
      which inturn can hold a number of logical partitions &#8211; I believe the
      number is close to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>15</TT
>. The extended partitions are not
      real partitions like primary or logical partitions in that they don't store
      data but are actually containers for logical partitions which is where data
      is actually stored &#8211; as you can see it is uneccessarily complex. Thus
      in Windows <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
> is a primary partition and if you used
      Windows <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> &#8211; Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> will not make more than one primary
      partition to partition your hard disk &#8211; <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>D</I
> is
      usually the first logical partition of the extended
      partition. <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>E</I
> would be the second logical partition
      and so on. In Linux things are slightly different. The first primary
      partition is called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
>, the
      second primary partition <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
>
      upto the fourth which is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda4</TT
>.
      Linux refers to the an extended partition as in the case of a disk with
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT
> primary and one extended partition as 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
> for the primary and 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
> for the extended. The
      logical partitions of the extended partitions are referred to as 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda5</TT
>, 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda6</TT
> and so on. The second hard disk
      would be referred to as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb</TT
>,
      the third <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdc</TT
> (usually the
      cdrom drive if set as secondary master) and the fourth and last hard disk as
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdd</TT
> (last because the
      motherboard has place for a maximum of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>4</TT
>
      <ACRONYM

>What <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> does is make a new primary
      partition out of the free space in your hard disk. This is an inherently
      dangerous operation and it's a good idea to back up all your important
      data lest something go wrong. Having said that
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> has been used successfully by a large
      number of people in different conditions and unless there is something
      already wrong with your hard disk, <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FAT</ACRONYM
> (File Allocation
      Table) or partition table things will work just fine. You should read the
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> documentation.</P
><P
>Before you set out to partition the hard disk you have to decide
      how you want to boot into Linux. The default and most common method is to
      use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> &#8211; a simple and basic bootloader
      program that overwrites (after saving) your hard disk's
      <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</ACRONYM
> (Master Boot Record) and on booting the system
      gives you a choice between booting either Windows or Linux. If you select
      Windows it boots Windows and you are met with the familiar windows screen
      or if you select Linux it boots Linux and if you don't make a choice in
      the stipulated time &#8211; could be anything from
      ±<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5</TT
> seconds depending on how you set it up
      &#8211; it boots the default operating system, Windows or Linux, again
      depending on how you set it up. You can restore your original
      <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</ACRONYM
> anytime, when uninstalling Linux for instance,
      either by typing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/sbin/lilo <CODE
CLASS="OPTION"
>-u</CODE
></B
> within
      Linux or typing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fdisk <CODE
CLASS="OPTION"
>/MBR</CODE
></B
> in DOS
      (this will overwrite the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</ACRONYM
> with the original Windows
      <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</ACRONYM
>) needless to say you would lose the option to boot
      into Linux after this and thus access to your Linux partition.</P
><P
>The problem with using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> especially
      for those with large disks is you would have to give up a substantial
      chunk of your disk space to Linux. This is not a flexible solution since
      while you can access your Windows partition from within Linux &#8211; the
      large <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MPEG</ACRONYM
> files can thus be stored in Windows and
      accessed by both operating systems &#8211; the alternate is not
      true.</P
><P
>This is because of an arcane <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</ACRONYM
> limitation
      that limits <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> to the first
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinders of the hard disk. Windows and Linux have
      no such limitations &#8211; it has something to do with address
      translation and <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>LBA</ACRONYM
> which I have yet to fully
      understand. Suffice to know the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</ACRONYM
> cannot access data
      that is beyond this <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit and since
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> is dependent on the
      <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</ACRONYM
> to boot the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>OS</ACRONYM
>'s nor can
      it. Thus if you want to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> to boot Linux
      you got to make sure that the Linux partition is well below the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit. My hard disk &#8211; and most
      modern hard disks have more than <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinders &#8211;
      has <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1650</TT
> cylinders and using
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> means making the Linux partition at about
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1000</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1010</TT
> cylinder mark which
      translates into a whopping <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5.2</TT
> Gb of
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.9</TT
> Gb to Linux and this wasn't working for me
      since my Linux stuff hardly need more than <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
> Gb
      and my Windows data on the other hand with <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MP3</ACRONYM
>'s and
      <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MPEG</ACRONYM
> movies needs a lot more than
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>7</TT
> Gb.</P
><P
>The solution, and in Linux there are always solutions, is
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Loadlin</SPAN
>, an underrated alternative to
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> which is inexplicably not as popular or
      widespread, inexplicable because it's far more flexible. If you intend to
      use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Loadlin</SPAN
> and for those with large hard-disks
      it's an excellent alternative you don't have to worry about the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit. Even better you can launch Linux
      from your Windows desktop and modify your
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>autoexec.bat</TT
> file to give you an option to boot into
      either of the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>OS</ACRONYM
>'s during boot time not unlike
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
>. You are then free to size your partitions
      as you please. In my case a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.2</TT
> Gb extended
      partition with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> logical partitions. That's right
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> partitions. It's normal to make three partitions, one
      for the Kernel boot files, one for the root partition and one for the swap
      partition but more on that later.</P
><P
>If you must use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> but are unwilling
      to give up a lot of space there is a solution. Place the Linux partition
      in the middle of the disk. You have to split the new partition you just
      created using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> into <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>
      (you would have to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> once again for
      this) the first partition which falls within the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
>
      cylinder limit can be used for Linux and the second you can use for
      Windows. Thus your hard disk will then have <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
>
      partitions the first and third for Windows and the one in the middle for
      Linux. I don't like this arrangement but it's up to you. (At the moment we
      are refering to the Linux partition as one but during the installation you
      will split it into <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> using the Linux tools) You can
      also make a small <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>15</TT
>-<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>20</TT
> Mb
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> partition and place it before
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder mark and the rest of the installation
      anywhere on the hard disk but again I quite don't like this.</P

      proceed &#8211; the program is extremely meticulous &#8211; answer yes
      obviously and when prompted to save a backup of your partition table and
      boot sector answer yes &#8211; this step is absolutely vital as it allows
      you to restore your hard disk to its unpartioned single partition state
      should anything go wrong. It also comes in handy if you want to uninstall
      Linux or resize your Linux partition. It doesn't matter what happens to
      the new partition in the meantime, if you have the back up you can restore
      your hard disk to its original unpartioned state. This reversible
      operation will work in all circumstances but one; if you format your
      original (Windows) partition which was split to make space for Linux in
      the meantime, the original <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

>Reboot using your Linux Installation CD &#8211; I use Redhat 6.2 which is
      fairly straight forward and I will focus on it. Most Linux distributions
      have really worked on their installation programs and you shouldn't have a
      problem. Just have the details about your hardware in hand, the horizontal
      and vertical refresh rate of your monitor in case the installation program
      doesn't automatically detect it ( you will find the exact figures in the
      manual ), the video card, its memory type ( <ACRONYM

      without going into the hex numbers in <SPAN

      only way to make a swap partiton is to give it its correct hex number
      which is <CODE

><P
>Let's start, in <SPAN

      <B

      table. Type <B

      which in this case would be 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
> (just type <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>)
      type <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>p</B
> again and you will see the change reflected in the
      partition table. There will now be a single <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FAT32</ACRONYM
>
      partition <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
> (which is
      actually <I

      holding two logical partitions <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

      <SPAN

>swap</SPAN

      holds three logical partitions. Now you have to size your extended
      partition properly since it's a container for the three logical
      partitions. From now on you just have to respond to
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
>. It will ask you to set the size of the
      extended partition that you want to create. This partition will start
      where your Windows partition ends and ends at the end of the disk. You can
      either give the size in <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>M</ACRONYM
> (megabytes) in cylinder
      numbers or in <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>K</ACRONYM
> (kilobytes). Just accept the default
      for the start of the partition and select the end cylinder number for the
      end &#8211; <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> will give you the end
      cylinder number.</P
><P
>Repeat the operation for the three logical partitions, only this
      time you would have to select logical instead of extended and the
      appropriate sizes which are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>16</TT
> Mb for the boot
      partition, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127</TT

      &#8211; it's simple, really! After creating the three partitions type

><P
>Programmers and Enthusiasts &#8211; For programmers Linux is already a
      near perfect solution. No other system gives so offers you a wider array of
      tools and platforms for development. The flexibility is simply amazing and
      it doesn't carry a price tag. An added benefit is the sense of community and
      that's priceless.</P
><P
>Enthusiasts never had it so good. There is aways something new to
      discover and since the system is totally transparent your chances of
      understanding computing and programming in general &#8211; you will be
      interested if you aren't already &#8211; are infinitely higher than in
      Windows. Tinkering will never be the same again.</P
><P
>For the home user &#8211; There are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5</TT
> separate
      areas here, the internet, 
      gaming, basic word processing, administration and multimedia. We aren't
      going to talk about ease of use here because the days of an ugly and
      unwieldy interface are long gone, at the moment as far as usability and
      sheer visual pizazz is concerned <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnome</SPAN
> has
      taken the pants off Windows so 
      there is nothing to worry about there. File management, installing and
      uninstalling software and basic administration are more streamlined and
      centralized and as you use Linux more you probably will get over any
      prejudice toward the command line which is nothing like the impotent 
      <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DOS</ACRONYM
> prompt. This is an outrageously powerful shell that
      will accomplish anything 
      you can think off faster than it takes you to select a button. You might be
      intimidated at first but its the heart of Linux the control centre, the
      headquarters, your direct line to the kernel. Hardware configuration is not
      as simple as in Windows mostly because plug and play has complicated things
      not eased them but it's not difficult either, the best thing to do is set
      your <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</ACRONYM
> to <EM
>non pnp</EM
> so that it
      can configure things especially the sound 
      card, but <EM
>read read read</EM
>. There is a lot
      of documentation on your system and with that behind you everything
      becomes simple. There is no excuse for ignorance.</P
