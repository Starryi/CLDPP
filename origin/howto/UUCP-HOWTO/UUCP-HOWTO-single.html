UUCP

This document describes the setup, care &amp; feeding of UUCP under Linux.
You need to read this if you plan to connect to remote sites via UUCP via a
modem, via a direct-connection, or via Internet.
You probably do *not* need to read this document if don't talk UUCP or if you
don't know what it means.</EM>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Goals </A>
</H2>


<P>The intent of this document is to answer some of the questions &amp; comments
that appear to meet the definition of "frequently asked questions" about UUCP
software under Linux genrally &amp; the version in the Linux Debian and
RedHat distributions in particular.</P>

<P>There is nothing "special" about configuring &amp; running UUCP under
Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do *NOT* want
to be posting generic UUCP-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*
newsgroups.</P>
<P>Don't post in comp.os.linux hierarchy unless it's really linux specific, for
example: "What's wrong with Debian 1.2 uucp?" or "RedHat 5.0 uucp crashes
when I run it" ...</P>
<P>Let me repeat that.</P>
<P>There is virtually no reason to post anything uucp-related in the
comp.os.linux hierarchy any more.  There are existing newsgroups in the
comp.mail.* hierarchy to handle *ALL* your questions.</P>
<P><EM>IF YOU POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.* FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, YOU ARE
LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR HELP.  THE UUCP EXPERTS HANG OUT IN THE PLACES
INDICATED ABOVE AND GENERALLY DO NOT RUN LINUX.</EM></P>
<P><EM>POSTING TO THE LINUX HIERARCHY FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WASTES YOUR
TIME AND EVERYONE ELSE'S AND IT FREQUENTLY DELAYS YOU FROM GETTING THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION.</EM></P>
<P>The GOOD PLACE is <CODE>comp.mail.uucp</CODE> since you can get answers for most of
your UUCP questions.</P>

</P>
<P>HDB &amp; V2 versions of UUCP are documented in about every vendor's
documentation as well as in almost all *nix communications books.</P>
<P>Taylor config. files are currently only documented in the info files provided
with the sources (&amp; in your distribution hopefully). 
The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>"Managing UUCP &amp; USENET"</CODE> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates is in my
opinion the best book out there for figuring out the programs &amp; protocols
involved in being a USENET site.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"Unix Communications"</CODE> from The Waite Group contains a nice
description of all the pieces (&amp; more) &amp; how they fit together.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"Practical Unix Security"</CODE> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates has a
nice discussion of how to secure UUCP.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"The Internet Complete Reference"</CODE> from Osborne is a fine
reference book that explains the various services available on Internet &amp; is
a great source for information on news, mail &amp; various other Internet
resources.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>The Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</CODE>" from Olaf Kirch of
the Linux DOC Project is available on the net &amp; is also published by (at
least) O'Reilly &amp; SSC.  It makes a fine <EM>one-stop shopping</EM> to learn
about everything you ever imagined you'd need to know about Unix networking.</LI>

</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!requirements!hardware
-->
</P>
<P>There are no specific hardware requirements for UUCP under Linux.
Basically any Hayes-compatible modem works painlessly with UUCP.</P>
<P>In most cases, you'll want the fastest modem you can afford, i.e. 56000 bps
actually.  In general, you want to have a 16550 UART on your serial board or
built into your modem to handle speeds of above 9600 baud.</P>
<P>If you don't know what that last sentence means, please consult the
<EM>comp.dcom.modems</EM> group or the various fine modem &amp; serial
communications FAQs &amp; periodic postings on USENET.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Software </A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!requirements!software
-->
</P>
<P>UUCP for linux is available everywhere, for example on sunsite.unc.edu.
But before trying to get any version, try to install &amp; make your current uucp
work ; there're many little differences between each linux distribution,
therefore it's easier for you to configure/install your distribution's UUCP
package rather than editing sources for some options, setting the right 
paths &amp; permissions, installing, etc.</P>
<P>But if you prefer sources ...</P>

<P> 1) Unpack </P>

<P>To extract a gzip'd tar archive, I do the following:
<PRE>
                gunzip -c filename.tar.z | tar xvf -
</PRE>

A "modern" tar can just do a:
<PRE>
               tar -zxvf filename.tgz
</PRE>
</P>

<P> 2) Run "configure" </P>

<P>Type <CODE>"sh configure"</CODE>.</P>
<P>The configure script will compile a number of test programs to see what is
available on your system &amp; will calculate many things.</P>
<P>The configure script will create <CODE>conf.h</CODE> from conf.h.in &amp;
<CODE>Makefile</CODE> from Makefile.in.  It will also create config.status, which
is a shell script which actually creates the files.</P>

<P> 3) Decide where to install </P>

<P>Rather than editing the Makefile.in file in the sources you can get the same
effect by:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        "configure --prefix=/usr/lib"
</PRE>
</P>

<P> 4) Edit "policy.h" for your local system </P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> - set the type of lockfiles you want (HAVE_HDB_LOCKFILES) </LI>
<LI> - set the type of config files you want built in
(HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG, HAVE_V2_CONFIG, HAVE_HDB_CONFIG)</LI>
<LI> - set the type of spool directory structure you want
(SPOOLDIR_HDB)</LI>
<LI> - set the type of logging you want (HAVE_HDB_LOGGING)</LI>
<LI> - set the default search path for commands
(I added /usr/local/bin to mine)</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P> 5) Then compile &amp; install the software </P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Type <CODE>"make"</CODE> to compile.</LI>
<LI>Type <CODE>"make install"</CODE> to install.</LI>
</UL>

</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!Taylor versus HDB mode
-->

(religious mode on - I know some people are just as religious about "ease
of use" as I am about "being standard".  That's why they make source code you
can build your own from :-) )</P>
<P>Because IMHO it's the de-facto standard UUCP implementation at this time.
There are thousands of sites with experienced admins &amp; there are many places
you can get incredibly good information concerning the HDB setup.</P>
<P>Moreover, if you know what HDB is, you shouldn't be reading this HOWTO :-)</P>
<P>Use the <CODE>uuconv</CODE> utility in /usr/sbin to convert config files from
one mode to another.</P>

<LI> from <EM>Ed Carp - erc at apple.com</EM> 
<P>If you use a "Direct" device in the Devices file, there's now a
10 second timeout compiled in.  Make the name of the Device anything
other than "Direct".  If you tweak the example /etc/uucp files
provided, you won't have problems with this one.</P>

</LI>
<LI> from <EM>Greg Naber - greg at squally.halcyon.com</EM> 
<P>If you get chat script timeouts, you can tweak the sources by 
editing at line 323 in uuconf/syssub.c &amp; changing the default
timeouts from 10 seconds to something larger.</P>

</LI>
<LI> from <EM>Ed Rodda - ed at orca.wimsey.bc.ca</EM>
<P>If you get chat script timeouts, typically connecting to other
Taylor sites, a pause after login can fix this.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Why doesn't HDB anonymous uucp seem to work?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!HDB anonymous uucp failure
-->

Taylor in HDB mode seems to be sensitive to white space &amp; blank lines.
To be safe, make sure that there are no blank lines or trailing spaces in the
Permissions file.</P>
<P>Lastly, make sure that you have a file called <CODE>remote.unknown</CODE> in
/usr/lib/uucp or /etc/uucp &amp; that it's <EM>*NOT*</EM> executable.</P>
<P>See the O'Reilly &amp; Associates book <CODE>"Managing UUCP &amp; USENET"</CODE> for
details regarding this file.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 What does "no matching ports found" mean?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!no matching ports error
-->

In all probability, you are attempting to use a dialer that doesn't exist, or
the dialer you've specified in the port files doesn't match up with any
valid devices in the dial file.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 What are known good config files for HDB mode?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!config files, known good
-->

The following are "known-good" config files for Taylor 1.05 under Linux in
HoneyDanBer mode.  They work on kernels of 0.99-8 or later. All files should
be in /usr/lib/uucp or /etc/uucp unless you've tweaked the sources to put the
uucp library elsewhere.</P>
<P>If you *HAVE* put things in non-standard places, be aware that things like
sendmail might get very confused. You need to ensure that all
communications-related programs agree on your idea of "standard" paths.</P>
