<P><EM>Low-Bandwidth X</EM> (LBX) attempts to recognize that in this day
and age, not everyone will be a fast LAN hop or two away from the system
that they are running their applications on.</P>
<P>The X protocol can generate an extraordinary amount of traffic,
especially for simple-seeming things such as creating new windows.  As
anyone who has tried to use X over a dial-in modem at 28.8 or even
higher can attest, creating new X windows can involve an excruciating
wait.</P>
<P>LBX is fundamentally a compression and caching scheme designed to
minimize the amount of X traffic generated between two systems.</P>
