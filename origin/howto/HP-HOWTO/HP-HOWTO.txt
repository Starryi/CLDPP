This document describes the use of products available in the Hewlett-Packard
(HP) catalog with Linux and some free software. It gives the state of the
support for hardware, software to use, answers to some frequently asked
questions and gives elements of sizing. The goals are to offer a general view
of free software functions and their use at best with HP products; as well as
to make new users of HP products rapidly operational and also to allow others
to choose their products knowing facts.

Chapter 1. Introduction


1.1. Presentation

This document is a guide on the use of products proposed by the hardware
manufacturer Hewlett-Packard (HP) under Linux. It's a quick reference guide,
covering all what you need to know to size, install and configure your products
under Linux, or which complementary software will be useful for their use.
Frequently Asked Questions find answers, and references are given concerning
other sources of information related to HP technologies and applications.
Opinions expressed here are those of the author, and don't commit both Medasys
or Hewlett-Packard . Informations are provided in the aim to be useful to the
readers. However, there can't be, through this document, any warranty of any
kind either from Medasys or HP on these systems under Linux, as well as from
myself. Neither Medasys, nor HP, nor the author could be responsible for any
problem caused by the use of this information. However, software editors don't
guarantee you a lot either (re-read the contracts).

Chapter 2. Presentation of Linux and Free Software


2.1. Some definitions

Before going into more details in the presentation, it could be useful to give
some definitions of terms and software mentionned in that HOWTO.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1. Free Software or Open Source software

A free software (or Open Source software) is a software distributed with its
source code, allowing its study, its transmission, its adaptation. The problem,
in english, is the use of free, which has both meanings of "at no cost" and
"without constraint". Here, it's the second use which has to be considered,
hence the use of Open Source. To remember, think of free as speech, not beer.
Depending on the licenses used for its development, the constraints for users
of such a software are various. The most open licenses (like the BSD one) allow
code appropriation by third parties, including the resell of the resulting
software (with or without modification) in commercial products, without any
problem, and without owing something else to the originators than the mention
of their copyright. Other licenses (like the GNU Public License or GPL) force
every modified GPL software to be free GPL software itself ; this doesn't allow
the use of such programs in a commercial one. Many other licenses exist, more
or less open: the Artistic License (perl), the NPL one (mozilla), the QPL one
(Qt) ...
A vast majority of free software is today under the GPL license, even if the
BSD world takes always a great place, however less visible, mainly in the
press. Linux is placed under the GPL. To have more information on these
definitions and the licenses, please refer to the following reference sites :


  GNU_project_Web_site
      You find there all information on the GNU project, including the licenses
      produced (GPL and LGPL) and various discussions on free software.

  Open_Source_project_Web_site
      This site proposes a new definition, a bit less restrictive, of free
      software - called here OpenSource Software - by well-known people.



  FreeBSD_project_Web_site
      Here are explained the advantages of the very open BSD license.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.2. Examples and counter-examples

First of all, free software and freeware shouldn't be mixed up. A freeware is
not necessarily a software provided with its sources, on the contrary of a free
software. On the other side, on the contrary of a freeware, you may be charged
to obtain a free software (it's not in contradiction with the license used).
The ambiguity, as stated before, comes from the word "free" . A freeware is
then free of charge, but not necessarily "free of sources". (As well, the
shareware has nothing to do with free software).
So examples of important and well-known free software are the Linux and FreeBSD
operating systems, the Apache Web server, the SaMBa SMB server, GNU C and C++
compilers ... A contrario, examples of well-known freeware are the Internet
Explorer browser, the Eudora Light mail reader, ...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3. Linux

Linux is a free operating system, superset of the POSIX norm. "Linux" points
out the kernel alone. By extension, the name is also given to distributions
based on that kernel plus a set of tools from the GNU project.
Linux is by consequence a Unix system, except that it doesn't use any
proprietary code and is furnished under the GPL license, implying the
availability of the sources. As every Unix system, Linux is multi-tasking and
multi-user. It's also extremely portable, and it is available officialy today
on processors such as Intel (i386 to Pentium IV), Alpha, Motorola (680x0 and
PowerPC), Sparc, StrongArm, Mips. Without mention of the ports, operational or
in process on PalmPilot, Itanium (ex-Merced), PA-Risc, Crusoe ...
The system is today perfectly stable and mature. Versions "x.y.z" of the Linux
kernel, where "y" is an even number, are stable and only bug corrections are
generaly applied when "z" increases. Versions "x.y.z" of the Linux kernel,
where "y" is an odd number, are development versions which may be instable and
are reserved to developers or intrepids.
From time to time, when the kernel development stabilizes a "freeze" is
announced to furnish a new "stable" version (even), and the development goes on
on a new version (odd).
The current stable version is the version 2.4.16 (this last number may evolve
following the rythm of corrections). Development has on the other side begun
again with a 2.5 version.
Numerous presentations of Linux are currently available. Among them, you should
consult the one made by Michael Johnson at http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/INFO-
SHEET.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3.1. Linux technical characteristics

The system offers the following technical characteristics :

* Multi-tasking : executes several programs in pseudo-parallel.
* Multi-users : many users acting on the same machine at the same time (without
  worrying on licenses).
* Portable and interoperable : works on several hardware architectures. All the
  sources are available. Linux supports a lot of file systems, outside the
  native ext2 : System V, BSD, Sun, MS-DOS, VFAT, NTFS, Mac, HPFS, EFS,
  ISO9660. On the network side, it supports the following protocols TCP/IP v4
  and v6, Appletalk, Netware (client and server), Lan Manager SMB (client and
  server), X-Window, NFS, PPP, SLIP, UUCP.
* Performant architecture : modular kernel, built at will, execution in protect
  mode on 80x86 processors, page load on demand, page share between executables
  when reading, virtual memory with swap on disk, use of a dynamical disk cache
  in memory, dynamic libraries, process management, pseudo terminals, virtual
  consoles.
* Security : protection of memory between processes: one user program can't
  compromise the whole system operation. The kernel may also, on the other
  hand, filter network packets.
* Respect of norms and standards : Posix, with System V and BSD extensions.
  Support of COFF and ELF binaries. Binary compatibility with SCO, SVR3/
  4 through the iBCS2 module. Native Language Support as well as national
  keyboards, fonts...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2. Free software concepts

Once the definitions are given, it is important to stay on at ideas promoted by
the free software movement. It's important as well to clear some wrong ideas
hawked on these software. This section gives then a various set of elements in
favour of the introduction of free software and ends on the real problems
remaining to solve.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1. Free software philosophy

In fact, the philosophy promoted by the free software movement is not that
different from the one proposed by the scientific movement till a long time
already: to put in common ideas and collective knowledge to allow the
progression of the research and the growth of this knowledge. The knowledge of
the human genome is one of the examples of such a collaborative work.
The computer engineering environment, and especially the software one, seems to
have turn away till the last 20 years from these base concepts of the
scientific world. It prefers on the contrary to keep the customer captive
instead of giving him the information needed to exploit his computing
environment the best he can. That's indeed following such a problem at the
begining of the 80's that Richard Stallman, who was doing researches in
artificial intelligence at the MIT, decided to create the GNU project. This
project is the foundation of the current free software movement.
The main ideas promoted by this movement and stated by Richard Stallman himself
are :

* Liberty: every user should be free to copy, diffuse, modify a program, either
  to share it with others, or to adapt it to his own needs. As well, he should
  be able to analyse it to understand, imitate, improve, verify its operations,
  as well as every scientific result is published and seen by the peers for
  verification, study, understanding and realisation of derived works. Could
  you imagine a vaccine against the liver cancer that another laboratory
  couldn't derive to make a vaccine against the pancres cancer. Of course, the
  negative impact of patents at that level is obvious.
* Equality: every person should have the same rights on the software. Thus the
  provider isn't priviledged and can't keep customers to whom he furnished his
  work captive. Could you think that only the producer of our vaccine could use
  it ? With software patents, if you don't pay, you cannot use them (think to
  discussions around RANT and W3C standards).
* Fraternity: this mode of working encourages the whole computer engineering
  community to cooperate and thus to produce software more and more reliable
  and useful to all. Could you imagine that a discovery like the vaccine above
  couldn't help everyone and favour other discoveries. Again with software
  patents, nothing like that is possible.

More over the utopy of these ideas, we can find other reasons which allowed
free software to spread so widely today. They are detailed in Section_2.2.2.
The free software movement materializes itself also through a community of
people. That community, informal meeting of personnalities, is heterogeneous in
its contents, actions, ideas, even if all share the same belief in the freedom
of the software. That community created for itself the tools needed to its
communication : Internet and Usenet. And these communication tools are based of
course on a lot of free software to work. Among the outstanding persons of this
movement, we can present :

* Linus_Torvalds, conceptor of Linux.
* Richard_Stallman, GNU project conceptor.
* Eric_S._Raymond, writer of several and excellent articles, which inspired so
  many vocations.
* Larry_Wall, author of Perl and of the patch tool, and philosopher.
* Alan Cox, mister "do everything".
* Tim O'Reilly <ask_tim@oreilly.com>, free software advocate and editor of
  several books dedicated to them.

All these personalities are, above all, excellent computer engineers, which
allows them to be recognized as major actors of the free software movement.
Their human and communication qualities are also strong characteristics of
their nature. In any case they aren't considered for their power, but for their
knowledge.
Of course, the free software community is built of thousands of programmers,
whose complete list would be too tedious. All share the will of producing
useful work, free, and to be recognized for their technical qualities above
all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2. The choice of free software

To use free software to bring solutions in a computing environment is a choice.
First, it is in favour of a plurality of solutions, mainly in the personal
computer world which tends to be monopolistic. Then, the choice is made, and
that's what is finally important, on the own qualities of free software, which
are detailed just below.


  Source code access
      This point is the most important of the choice, because it allows the
      undestanding, adaptation, correction, distribution, improvement of the
      software.

  Reliability
      That quality is derived from the previous one: the free software is the
      combined result of the experience and the intelligence of all the
      participants. Its reliability increases then as time passes, with all the
      corrections which are made. More over, no marketing pression requires the
      software's producer to deliver it to its customers before it is in a
      satisfactory state.

  Portability
      This quality is not intrinsic to free software, but is very often seen in
      a free software. Indeed if a softawre meets success, it will necessarily
      be adapted to other environments than those initialy considered. Thus by
      increasing its disponibility, its portability and reliability are also
      increased. linux works today on a HP Jornada or IBM watch, as well as on
      s390 or SuperDome.

  Universality
      One essential quality of free software is the character naturaly
      universal of the data format used. Even if they don't follow standards,
      the availibility of the source code assures the user that he will
      understand them, and more over be able to write any filter needed to
      reuse these data or exchange them with other software. This allows also
      users to stabilize their environment, because they are not required to
      migrate due to incompatibility of data formats in their applications.
      Don't forget that your data are precious ans thet it's better to archive
      them under a *ML format (HTML, XML, SGML, ...) rther than a proprietary
      one.

  Performance
      Resulting from a lot of examinations, the use of algorithms coming from
      advanced research works, as well as tested by various usages, free
      software have good performances by nature. Frequently large portions of
      code are rewritten to allow the reuse of the original ideas with a better
      code and thus to increase performances. Several tests made by various
      organisms tend to prove it also
      Table 2-1. Performances of Free Software

      Subject                           URL
      Apache Web Server and competitors http://www5.zdnet.com/products/content/
                                        pcmg/1709/305867.html
      SMB SaMBa server vs Windows NT    http://www.zdnet.com/sr/stories/news/
                                        0,4538,2196106,00.html

      Once more, there is no obligation to diffuse an application whose
      performances would be bad.

  Interoperability
      Interoperability is a reality of today's enterprises. Historically, Unix
      environment was always a ferment for interoperability with other systems
      (big or medium size systems, as well as personal computers). The support
      in Linux, for example, of a lot of network protocols, filesystem formats,
      and even binary compatibility modes assures a good interoperability. By
      the way, interoperability requires 2 actors, and having only one open is
      generally not sufficient. That's the goal of having RFCs, norms,
      standards, ...

  Reactivity
      When considering the more and more longer development cycles of the
      software editors, the reactivity brought by the free software movement is
      interesting for a lot of sites, concerned by the rapid obtention of
      corrections to a given problem. Thus, during the recent discoveries of IP
      problems (ping of the death,...), patches were always available within
      the next 3 days. And above that, only the patch correcting the hole found
      was delivered. There were no functionality added, which could have create
      other instabilities.

  Security
      The best computing security possible is ensured by a robust construction,
      public and reknown algorithms, a quick communication around flaws, ... In
      other words by transparency. Obscurity is in this domain bad, useless and
      even dangerous. In the free software world, the reactivity described in
      the previous paragraph is a garanty of increased security, ... at the
      condition that patches are applied regularly.

Independantly of its qualities, it's possible to give other reasons of various
nature, in favor of free software, depending on the type of the person met.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.1. Marketing argumentation

Studies from IDC bring to light the irresistible rise of Linux as a server
operating system. In 1998, Linux is credited with 17% of market share, with an
increase of 212%, which is the most important in that domain. The following
graphics give the whole market share repartition.
Figure 2-1. Server operating system repartition in 1998 (IDC).
This was confirmed in 1999 with a market share climbing to 24% and an ancrease
of 93%, always more than four times the increase of the follower.
Figure 2-2. Server operating system repartition in 1999 (IDC).
Dataquest estimates on its side that Linux servers will represent, with 1.1
million of units, 14% of the servers sold in 2003.
The Net itself produces marketing tools to demonstrate the superiority of free
software. Counters are regularly updated by Netcraft and others, on web server
software, and another was done by IOS_Counter for the servers on Internet.
Results, reproduced below, show the importance taken by Apache with more than
16 millions of operational sites (among them 30% run Linux), crushing the
competition, as well as the free operating systems Linux and *BSD which
dominate the world of Internet servers.

2.2.2.2. Financial argumentation

Financial factors also speak for free software. And first the price to aquire
them is low. Low, because it's never zero. Even if you can find it on the
Internet, you have to consider the costs related to that link. However costs
are greatly less expensive than for commercial software. So a RedHat 7.2 Linux
distribution, delivered with more than 1400 software packages, costs about 60
USD when you have to pay more than 800 USD to obtain Windows 2000 server,
delivered only with IIS.
On the other side, free software don't have the notion of license by user or by
supplmentary service. Thus there is no additional cost when you have to
increase the use of these software in your entity. That's of course not the
case with commercial software whose economical logic is often based on the
number of licenses.
Free software bring in addition a better mastering of the TCO (Total Cost of
Ownership), mentionned so frequently in the massive deployment of personal
computers. Thus administration costs are reduced because systems like Linux or
FreeBSD, as Unix, are managed completely remotely, either through command line
orders (with telnet or ssh) or in graphical mode by using X-Window. More over,
we benefit from a true multi-users mode, improving these management operations.
Always in this domain, it's also possible to do remote management, either
through the own hardware capacities of the machine (as the Remote Assistant
card integrated in most HP NetServers), or by doing a remote connexion (through
modem, ISDN adapter or a permanent link) thanks to the native PPP protocol and
secure connexion systems as tunneling or ssh. This managemnt could even be
realised by an external entity, in outsourcing.
At last, the costs due to the hardware themselves could be controled; on one
side, if by chance free software don't meet the needs, it's always possible to
buy then commercial software solutions to cover the rest on the same hardware.
On the other side, solutions based on free software have good performances by
nature, and can use hardware platforms which would be considered as obsolete,
if installed following the standard criterias of other operating systems or
applications. The fact to separate the graphical interface from the rest of the
working system is here key. It's so possible to use "old" hardware, mainly to
model. It's then possible to invest, with a fine knowledge, when puting the
solution in operation, if needed. The power increase may naturaly take place
progressively.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.3. Technical argumentation

This argumentation was already given in the previous sections. I think
nevertheless that some notions may be explained with complementary information.
So concerning the reliability aspects of free software based solutions, it's
important to note that it implies an operational running time very high
(standard characteristic of Unix systems in general). This is mesured by the
command uptime. One of Medasys and HP customers, Saint-Michel Hospital in
Paris, has a Vectra VL5 acting as router under Linux since more than 300 days.
And that's not a isolated case.
Respect of standards and norms, as well as the extreme portability of free
software assures also to applications developed on these platforms the same
qualities. And notably, if after their use, the performances or services
brought by free software based architectures were insufficient (it may be
caused by architecture problems such as PCI bandwidth, number of processors
available, ...), it would be easy to migrate to machines offering more
performances and capacities of evolution, as the HP 9000 systems, running HP-
UX.
At last a development plan centered around performances implies a modularity,
such as it's possible to resize the system kernel nearest to the capacities of
the hardware or to use dynamically loaded modules following the needs. A
packages installation may vary from 40 MB for a minimal system up to many GB
for a complete distribution. The system linearity allow also the support of
multi-processors machines (SMP) (tested up to 32 processors on a Sparc
machine). The system modularity allows also to obtain an operational system on
a 1.44 MB floppy disk, either to realize a minimal repair environment, or to
provide a perfectly operational router. The world of embedded systems shows
besides more and more interest for systems such as Linux, because above it's
modularity, source availability makes communication with dedicated peripherals
easier (acquisition cards, sonde, ...). Entities as CERN or Thomson already use
such solutions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.4. Solutions argumentation

That argumentation is probably the most important of all, because it's useless
to have free software if it's not to make something useful with it or to offer
solutions to demands of entities willing to use it. In which sectors free
softawre may bring solutions today ? Well, you have to admit it's in nearly all
the sectors of enterprise computing.
Historically, Open Source Software were used to realise Internet/Intranet
servers, because their growth was following the one of the Net. It's so
possible to cover all aspects linked to the Internet, from the Web server
( Apache ), FTP server (Wu-Ftpd), DNS server (Bind), the E-Mail server
(Sendmail or PostFix ), the Usenet groups server (INN), the proxy server
(IPmasqadm), the firewall (IPChains or IPTables), Virtual Private Network
(OpenSSH), the Cache server for the Web ( Squid ) or also the Time server (NTP)
or as directory service(LDAP) server, or as content management(Midgard) server
... All these software are available in standard in a Linux distribution. The
client computer should be equiped with the software corresponding to the
application used (mail reader, news reader, web browser, ...) whatever its
operating system. The choice of the client is free, as all these tools respect
the standards decreed in the RFCs.
The second preferential domain for free software is the file and print server
domain. For these services, clients may be multiple: Unix type (use of NFS and
KNFS or also Coda and Inter-Mezzo, for file sharing and of lpd or CUPS for
print service), Microsoft Windows type (use of SaMBa , which allows also the
use of local client printers), Novell type (use of Mars_nwe) or MacIntosh type
(use of NetAtalk). All these software are provided in standard in a Linux
distribution and don't need any modification at the client level to work.
The other domains where a system such as Linux may bring solutions is the
computation one, with support of multiprocessor, linked to the realisation of
clusters_with_multiple_nodes with Mosix or BeoWulf with high-speed network
interfaces (100 Mbit/s, Gigabit or Myrinet); those of data security with the
support of HP NetRaidRem. cards, allowing Raid level of 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 50, and
HotSpare disks, managed by the harware; those of centralized fax server, with a
free software like HylaFAX or also as an archive/backup server with HP
SureStore DAT or DLT libraries thanks to a GPL software like Amanda or a
commercial one like Arkeia or at last as a database server with free solutions
like PostgreSQL,MySQL or commercial like Oracle, to speak only of these three.
On the client side, even if it's less highlighted for the moment, possibilities
to use solutions based on free or commercial software are numerous. Here also
the Internet part is the main one, with tools like graphical web browsers
(Netscape, Mozilla or Konqueror) or textual (lynx or w3m), a lot of graphical
mail readers (Kmail, XFMail, ...) or textual (mutt, elm, ...). But you also
have the whole panel of indispensable tools for a personal computer today as a
PDF reader (Acrobat_Reader or xpdf), image manipulation tools (ImageMagick, the
Gimp, RealPlayer_tools ...), word processors (LyX, LaTeX, SGMLTools,
Wordperfect, ...), commercial office suites (ApplixWare, StarOffice), or
opensource (Koffice, OpenOffice, ...), sound management tools (Xmms, eplaymidi,
xmcd, ...), CD burning tools (cdrecord, BurnIT, ... with complements as
mkisofs, cdparanoia, cdrdao), free and commercial emulators for various systems
(Wine, Executor, WABI, DOSEmu,Win4Lin, VmWare...), compilers and interpretors
for all the languages (C, C++, Pascal, Fortran, Basic, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python,
Ada, Eiffel, Lisp, Scheme, Prolog...), including commercial versions (PGI,
Intel...), graphical environments (Gnome, KDE, Motif, OpenMotif, ...). The
evolution of these last tools indicates that the 2000's may be the years where
Linux and free software will break through at their turn on the client.
I want to mention that this document was realised on an HP Brio BAx, then on a
Vectra VL400 equiped only with a Linux distribution, with the help of tools
like DSSSL_style_sheet, OpenJade and DocBook, ViM which allowed to generate
from a single source the formats HTML, Txt, RTF, PostScript, and PDF.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2.5. Service argumentation

This one was for a long time a blocking point to the expansion of free software
in the firms. It's not the case today. Many service providers or hardware
manufacturers, like HP, control today these solutions and propose support
around them, uoto missions critical if requested.
Other sources of information are also available, in abundance, through several
web sites dedicated to these solutions, specialised mailing-lists, and various
Usenet groups, such as for Linux, the international groups under
comp.os.linux.* or for the french speaking people under fr.comp.os.linux.*.
Concerning competences, more and more young engineers or academics finish their
learning cycle being trained to the use of free applications and operating
systems. This wealth of competences arrives now on the labour market and will
contribute to increase the movement of generalisation of these tools. At last,
many firms have internaly ignored competences. In fact, their employees often
install this software at home, and have a good mastering, usable when arrives
the deployment of the software in their professional structure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.3. Wrong ideas on free software

Advocating free software consists also to mention some generally accepted ideas
concerning them and to fight them.


  "There is no support, no training"
      As seen previously, support is currently structuring itself. A firm like
      RedHat provides today support for their solutions. Only in France, we may
      mention firms like Medasys , Atrid, Alcove which assure support on free
      software. Likewise, always in France, training on free software may be
      given by HP_France, Learning_Tree, the IUT_de_Vélizy, without mentioning
      generic network and Unix trainings (besides proposed also by the same
      organizations) which represent a fundamental base in a training course.
      And at last, we should mention the ability of each of us to self-train,
      mainly thanks to the huge documentation available (See the Chapter_7).

  "There is no documentation"
      There is a whole set of manuals, the Linux_Documentation_Project, made of
      FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and HOWTO, counting more than 300
      documents around Linux, the main being translated_in_french, and in
      japanese available as free documentation. This documentation has a
      various quality, more or less up to date, following the subjects,
      certainly but it makes a corpus allowing to apprehend alone a Linux
      distribution and all its components. For myself, I always found in it
      everything I needed to do my job with free software. And, in case of
      complementary information, a lot of web sites and Usenet groups may again
      bring some of the elements needed. And without counting the innumerable
      manual pages available on line. Each distribution comes also with a
      comprehensive set of manual covering all the tasks of installing,
      handling and managing them.
      On the other side, the editors O'Reilly and SSC have specialised in
      providing books around free software, written generaly by the writers of
      the software themselves. Their books are considered as reference books in
      their respective domains.

  "A free or nearly free product is a toy"
      You should always make a difference between free (as speech) and free (as
      beer). Too many freeware in Microsoft environment are in fact toys and of
      poor quality. It's absolutely not the case for free software, as stated
      in the previous sections. Remember just that they are reliable by
      construction.

  "Linux is difficult to install"
      Linux is a professional operating system. At that title, it requires
      competences to install it, as well as any other professional operating
      system, like the other Unix or Windows NT for example. But it isn't more
      difficult to install than those either, mainly thanks to distributions as
      RedHat, Mandrake, ... You need about 30 minutes to realize a complete
      installation of such distributions, so quite the same as for HP-UX and
      noticeably less than for Windows NT Server.
      On the other hand, as before installing a server with Windows NT you have
      to verify its compatibility with the Hardware_Compatibility_List of
      Microsoft, for Linux it's also greatly recommended to verify the Hardware
      HOWTO, and for HP machines to refer to Section_3.2.

  "Free Software are not adequate for heavy tasks"
      This is less and less true and this criticism has been obsoleted with the
      latest versions of the Linux kernel which will include a journalised
      filesystem, allowing a true application cluster. But already Linux
      authorises the use of multi-processors, several nodes to realise
      computation clusters. And don't forget it's used by the portal Voila
      (France Telecom) or the engine Google among other prestigious references.
      As well, FreeBSD is used with success as the world biggest ftp server :
      Walnut_Creek_CDROM_server Useful projects to consult in this area of high
      availability are http://www.linux-vs.org, http://www.opengfs.org and
      http://www.linux-ha.org

  "What appeal do I have in case of problem with the editors ?"
      There is no appeal, because software licences deny all responsabilities
      for the writers, in case of problem. But, in reality developers are
      always ready to help in case of problem and try to correct as soon as
      possible the bugs encountered (for the F00F bug of the pentium, a patch
      for the Linux kernel was published within 3 days, for example). On the
      other side, commercial editors guarantee very badly users against
      problems other than packaging errors. Please read the notes furnished
      with your software to judge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.4. Real problems around free software

It would not be honest to negate certain remaining problems linked to free
software. Some have begun to disappear, other are inherent to the system, other
at last will take time to diappear.
The first problem, inherent to the model of free software, is the multiplicity
of tools and distributions available. So, if you want to setup a mail server,
you have to choose between Sendmail, Exim, PostFix, Qmail, Smail. As well if
you want to install Linux, you may choose between the distributions RedHat ,
SuSE, Slackware, Mandrake, Turbo_Linux, Debian. This represents often a problem
for the newcomer, but the esperienced user will always prefer to have a large
choice he will confront to his particularities and to his experience. As long
as an actor respects the rules by freeing his code (it's the case of the rpm
and deb formats for example), there is little risk from the comunity point of
view. The key point is that the choice is made only taking in account technical
criterias.
The second problem, inherent also to the free software birth, is the necessity
to have strong Unix and Internet competences, to manage such solutions. The
power available through these systems is proportional to the competence of
their administrators. And that will stay true even with the growth of more and
more grahical solutions to manage them. On the other side, you capitalize the
investment in time to learn their functions and that doesn't disappear, because
you don't have to re-learn eveything from one version to the other (I use the
same editor, vi, for the last 15 years). Don't forget that systems you use
daily seem to be simple, uniquely because you passed enough time to learn them.
For Internet competences, it's a statement of the obvious to say that this
investment isn't lost. At last, even with the work of translators to provide
information in french and other languages, a good knowledge in technical
english is definitively a plus.
The last problem met in the implementation of free software solutions is to
suceed in convincing some managers to go against the prevailing opinion. The
aim of this chapter is precisely to give all sorts of argumentations to achieve
that goal, but you need each time to show conviction to get his way in the end.
As soon as these solutions will be adopted by big firms principaly, resistances
will disappear.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3. Linux and other operating systems

The aim is not to examine completely or to compare the functions of the various
operating systems available. It's more upon looking at the respective positions
of Linux in comparaison with other systems. Only systems having a sufficient
representation on the market are considered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.1. Linux and other proprietary Unix (HP-UX, Tru64, AIX, Solaris, Irix)

The situation taken by all the hardware manufacturers places Linux today in the
entry level (when it's taken in account) and their own Unix system in the
middle and high level. Reality is sometimes more cruel than the situation
wanted by the marketing department :-). Technically, a Linux distribution has
no cause to be envious of the manufacturers Unix solutions, except for the
moment the set of commercial applications and some high-end hardware
configuration support. And we can often see that users dope their Unix
workstations with free software to complete their usage.
To be precise in the talk, we should consider manufacturers Unix solutions as
split in stations and servers.
On the station side, there's no doubt in my mind: for a customer, the only
reason today to buy one is linked to the availability of a software or a
hardware which wouldn't exist in the free environment, or due to intrinsic
performances of the machine. In the first case, we can see that this argument
should have a short life time, because logically every software editor (except
maybe hardware manufacturers) and every hardware manufacturer has interest in
porting their applications or allowing the use of their hardware on all the
major environments in the market. As shown by Oracle, Informix, Sybase, ...
Linux becomes today one of the major environments. In the second case, the
difference in term of performances between the Linux dominant platform (IA-32)
and the other competitors decreases and will disappear with the generalisation
of the IA-64 architecture, which seems to be adopted largely by a majority of
actors. More over, Linux is often available natively on the processors of these
actors (Sparc, Mips, PowerPC, 68xxx, Alpha, Crusoe, PA-Risc). I think Linux may
represent the famous unique and standard Unix that everybody dreamed of from a
long time, without succeeding to impose it (the open and free characteristics
brought by Linux are not without influence on that). I think that at the end
hardware manufacturer Unix workstations will be restricted to some niches such
as high end computation, virtual reality, ... and that as long as solutions are
not available on a free environment. Linux offers all the functional qualities
of the other Unix systems, and thus of the workstation, on a more various
hardware platform and potentially at a better price, if on PCs. So it is the
natural choice of every computer engineer with a strong Unix culture (old
customer of the workstation) who will prefer that solution to the migration to
a Microsoft system typically. With IA-64, we can see that Linux was the first
operating system available (including graphical support).
On the server side, in addtion to the points mentionned previously for the
stations, problems are more complex. Ram, disks, processors capacities,
extensions of every kind make them difficultly repleacable by machines with a
IA-32 architecture for example. More over, certain solutions such as high
availability clusters for example have just been put in production in a Linux
environment, compared to years of operation under Unix. The other brake is
often linked to investments already done around software solutions deployed on
these servers. Whatever their natural life time is much higher than those of
the stations. Changes will thus be made more slowly in that domain. Here we can
consider rightly Linux solutions as an entry/middle level solutions, when
hardware manufacturer Unix servers are the middle/high level. The introduction
of Linux in place of these machines will begin only with a massive availability
of applications, mainly in the management sector. Again IA-64, with increased
SMP capabilities (16 processors today), higher bandwidth, ... will make things
change.
The advantages of the hardware manufacturer solutions, explaining why they are
so often chosen when applications are critical, are linked to the homogeneity
of the solution (hardware and software mastered by the same entity, which can't
invoke a third party in case of problem), and to the support and maintenance
guarantees furnished.
Finally, there is not so much antagonism between these systems, because they
are full cousins. Their association allows today to computer teams "pro-Unix"
to have solutions from start to finish, without having to lose in functions, as
it's so often the case with other operating systems available for personal
computers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.2. Linux and SCO/Caldera

The comparaison between Linux and the SCO systems seems to me quite unbalanced.
First, all the previous points are vaild here also. More over, SCO isn't a
hardware manufacturer, so the homogeneity advantage disappears. The IA-32 Intel
platform is supported by both systems, so cost is identical. On the other hand,
the software solution has a disproportionate cost (few software provided in the
base install, thus a lot of expenses to extend, as well as to increase the
number of users). Having to manage one OpenServer, I can say that performances
are far beyond those of a Linux system. More over, its conception is older,
abounds of symbolic links which makes management complex. The hardware
supported by SCO is less numerous than those Linux supports. Only stay as an
advantage the installed base and the set of applications available. But for how
long ? Caldera now owns both SCO software (Openserver and Unixware) and its own
Linux distribution. But instead of trying to free technologies from SCO, they
are proprietarizing their linux (1 license per server).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.3. Linux and Windows NT/2000/XP

The comparaison is here more difficult, because Windows NT/2000/XP isn't an
open system, as the precedings, which is already redhibitory for certain users.
An excellent comparaison was made by John Kirch between Unix and Windows NT
Server. I recommend to people searching to have an enlightened opinion on this
subject to read it; it's updated regularly and was written by a specialist of
both Microsoft and Unix operating systems. Financially, obvious advantage for
the free software. And it's more obvious, as for SCO, if you consider the set
of complementary software you need to use a server. The author evaluates the
difference from 1 to 100 all the same ! Technically, either on the functions
provided or on the reliability, the administration, the performances, the
hardware supported, and more over the security, Unix systems and particularly
free systems outperform what is proposed by Windows NT/2000/XP. The fact to
have a GUI non independant from the kernel contributes greatly to the
instability of NT/2000/XP, because it's more difficult to avoid errors in a GUI
(there is no mastering possible of the user comportment in front of it) rather
than in a kernel.
Which are the real advantages of Windows NT ?: the marketing power of Microsoft
which persuades the world that computers equal Windows and which leans on the
enormous installed base; its office applications (a monopolistic situation on
the market) only available in this environment; the confusion maintained
between the various flavours of Windows (95/98, NT, 2000), and between the
server and client functions; its agreements with the biggest hardware
manufacturers which often require them to provide a Microsoft system with their
platforms; its technological initiatives to occupy the market in first, based
on proprietary code and that often without respect of known or documented
standards, or its policy to embrace for killing a movement (described in the
"Haloween_documents").
The lack of hegemony in the servers sector is the best reason to hope that a
plurality of solutions may exist in the future for computers users, also at the
desktop. The new XP licensing schema, the passport tool, the registering
mechanism during installation are real brakes for users thinking to migrate
from a current platform to a new one, as well as the hardware costs linked. In
that perspective, an opensource solution should and will be more and more
considered.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chapter 3. Linux and HP products

To maintain such a chapter is an endless task :-).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Informations on HP products and Linux


3.1.1. General information

HP became recently concious of the importance taken by Linux and free software
in general, and on its machines particularly. Thus a web site dedicated to
Linux in HP environment is now available at http://www.hp.com/go/linux.
In France, there is for a longer time a site on these themes, under the
responsability of Jacques Misselis <Jacques_Misselis@hp.com>, hosted by l'École
Centrale_de_Lyon at the address http://hpwww.ec-lyon.fr/hpeduc/education.
On the other side, the firm Medasys for which I worked between 1996 and 2000,
put at disposition of the community a certain number of information since 1997,
available at http://www.medasys.fr/linux. This HOWTO is the result of this
work.
HP also realised a synthesis document (PDF format) concerning his position in
front of Linux, the White_Paper_HP_Linux_Strategy (1999-04).
HP is a member or sponsor of Linux_International,Open_Source_Development_Lab,
and Linux_Standard_Base.

HP France has also published an article on Linux and free software in its May
1999 issue of HP Computer News, an article on HP Linux support in the September
1999 issue, and an article on Linux RedHat solutions on HP Visualize
workstation in the November 1999 issue.

3.2. HP hardware supported by Linux

This section presents HP hardware supported today by Linux. Informations are
based on the latest stable version of the Linux kernel, which is currently
version 2.4.16. A development kernel (version 2.5) is also available but
doesn't offer any guarantee of stability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. Intel based computer range

Page last updated the 2001-12-21.
That computer range is today the main set of HP machines supported by Linux,
and that till many years. In case you didn't already do it before, some
preliminaty readings are recommended before to try to install Linux on these
platforms.
The Linux_Installation_HOWTO contains a great number of information to install
Linux. If you bought linux on a CD-ROM, chances are that installation
instructions are provided with it (the little booklet inside the disk case,
and/or files on the CD).
The Linux_Kernel_HOWTO should be read to have details on kernel construction. I
will just mention here points which are specific to HP hardware.
Outside particular indication, Linux support means during the installation of a
RedHat/Mandrake type distribution. In special cases, a kernel rebuild will be
necessary to support completely some hardware elements. You should note that
what is true for one distribution is generally true for another, as these
functions are linked to the kernel or the XFree86 server, and not to the
distribution itself.
In case of problem, the first reflex should be to update the BIOS of the HP
machine, and to verify whether the problem is always there. If yes, you may
then contact HP support, if your configuration is supported by HP (This
document focus on what is working, superset of what is supported, and has no
value in that area). On the other hand, if your machine is working correctly,
don't update the BIOS without reason, this is always a risked operation. BIOS
updates are available from http://www.hp.com/cposupport/software.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1.1. The desktop range (Brio, Vectra, Kayak)

HP has a new program called "Freedom of Choice" on the whole desktop range.
Linux is thus one of the operating systems pushed by HP. Cf: http://www.hp.com/
desktops/linux/ and http://www.hp.com/pressrel/aug00/14aug00.htm.
A FAQ is also available.
HP insures the support of certified Linux hardware by the following method :
all the machines have the Diagtool utility. If this utility indicates a
problem, it's taken in account by HP maintenance. If it doesn't, it's
considered as a software problem and should be reported to the distribution
provider.
The following tables indicate the state of Linux support by these platforms :

3.2.1.3. The workstation range (Visualize, HP workstation)

Visualize systems come in two flavors: the p and x class systems are
preinstalled, supported, and configured with Windows; the pl and xl class
systems are preinstalled, supported, and configured with Linux. There is no
hardware difference between the base systems, but the Linux image that is
preinstalled on the pl and xl is customized so that all drivers for the systems
are preconfigured -- there's no need to specify or tune the box and drivers.

CD-ROM, DVD and ZIP drives are supported by Linux kernel. Read the various
HOWTO for their use, following the interface type.
There are 4 supported graphics cards with XFree86 on HP x2000 and x40000
systems with Linux: SynergyPlus, Synergy2, Matrox G450, and FireGL2/4. There
are also 4 rpms that are associated with these cards and they must be present
on your system in order to have a supported graphics environment: synergyplus,
synergy2, firegl2 and mgag450. For example, to check for the existence of the
firegl2 rpm, run
 _________________
|                 |
|  #rpm -q firegl2|
|_________________|

Once you have installed the new card and rebooted, run /usr/X11R6/bin/
graphicsconfig to configure the card. If it is a recognized card supported by
your Linux system, the function will return the name of the card and it will be
configured to run. At this point you may start up your X window environment.
If it returns "UNKNOWN", then your graphics card either is not one of the 4
currently supported cards, or it is a newer/older version of the card than is
supported. In either case you will need to run Xconfigurator to set it up.

3.2.1.5. The mobile computer range (OmniBook)

To suspend to disk the current session, you need to not have deleted the
hibernation partition (type a0), which size should be the size of the RAM, to
have support for APM in the kernel, and to use the key combination Fn+F12.
To send the video signal, either to an external screen, or through the docking
station, it is be necessary to add the following parameter to your XFree86
configuration file /etc/X11/XF86Config:
 ______________________
|                      |
|  [...]               |
|  Section "Device"    |
|  [...]               |
|  Options "crt_screen"|
|  [...]               |
|______________________|

This concerns mobile computers using ATI chipsets. The switch is done by
pressing simultaneously on Fn-F5.
Most of the OmniBook have in option a "Port Replicator" system allowing,
according to the model, to support PCI cards, complementary ports, ...

For TopTools Remote Control Cards (TTRCC), the B.02.02 firmware release shows
some strange symptoms at boot time, namely you get no data in your browser
(Netscape on Linux) until way past selftest and LILO, so it's kind of hard to
boot an alternate kernel. The fix is to 'downgrade' your firmware on the TTRCC
to B.02.00. You can see what revision you're running on the TopTools 'Identity
Screen'. You can flash the eeprom on the TTRCC anytime (unless you really want
to make a DOS floppy and reboot) by tftping the right firmware (ttrc0200.bin)
in the 'Configuration' tab -> 'Card Info' area, and press 'Update'. It takes a
minute or so to download/verify/and reset the TTRCC. (Information from Lee
Mayes)

3.2.1.11. HP Blade Server

Information concerning these machines are available at http://www.hp.com/
products1/servers/blades/index.html

* Debian: 2.2r3 kernel 2.2.19
* Red Hat: 7.0 kernel 2.2.16
* SuSE: 7.1 kernel 2.4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1.12. UPS

Hp doesn't make UPS anymore, but has a world-wide agreement with APC. APC
distributes a free software (no cost, not open-source), to manage its UPS under
Linux. It's available at http://www.apcc.com/products/management/pcp_linux.cfm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1.13. Complementary information

Please refer to the Hardware_Howto and Ethernet_Howto for other details
concerning the support of some hardware elements by Linux.
For video chipsets support, a fundamental page is the one of XFree86 with its
supported chipsets list.
Commercial servers are also available, as those of X-Inside and MetroLink
Netvectra are not supported by Linux.
Driver supporting the HP GPIB cards (IEEE 488) HP 27209 (= HP 82990, HP 61062,
HP 88500) and HP 82335 is available at the following address : ftp://
ftp.llp.fu-berlin.de/pub/linux/LINUX-LAB/IEEE488.
Another GPIB driver may be found at this address http://www.inesinc.com/
linux.htm.


  Multimedia keyboards
      Some of the PCs provided by HP are equiped with a multimedia keyboard.
      You may use the additional keys thanks to the HotKeys daemon (Cf: http://
      freshmeat.net/projects/hotkeys/)

3.2.3. PA-Risc based computer range

The PA-Risc range is achitectured around a processor designed and realised by
HP. First versions were produced in 1987. Currently the versions are named PA-
8000 (8200, 8500, ...).
The initiative to port Linux on the PA-RISC architecture was taken during the
Atlanta Linux exhibition in October 1998. HP has announced in February 1999 its
sponsorship to this port of Linux. This port is a native one, which is
different from a preceding project which used MkLinux on machines based on PA-
7200. The work is currently done with The_Puffin_Group bought by Linuxcare, and
more precise information on the status may be found on the official_Web_site.
In particular, interesting starting points may be found on http://www.parisc-
linux.org/faq.html and http://www.parisc-linux.org/hw.html. Consult also ESIEE
site (712 on Linux/PA) which participates actively to the port : http://
mkhppa1.esiee.fr/en/ The last version is 0.9.3. It supports the following
systems L1000, L2000, A500, A180, B, C, J, D, R, 742, 725, 735, 755, 705, 710,
720, 730, 750, 712, 715.
This version supports 32 and 64 bits modes, SMP (1-4 way), RAM up to 16 GB, HP-
UX compatibility, X-Window, KDE, Gnome, 80% of Debian packages.
Debian has accepted PA-RISC as a supported architecture for the upcoming Debian
GNU/Linux 3.0 (woody) stable release. http://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/.
Thomas Marteau has written a HOWTO on the way to boot concretely a Pa-Risc
suystem. It's available at http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PA-RISC-Linux-Boot-
HOWTO/index.html.
FAQ is also available at http://dsportal.eservices.hp.com/dspp/tech/
tech_TechDocumentDetailPage_IDX/1,1701,276,00.html.
There is on the other side for these machines a Linux project based on the
MkLinux micro-kernel. This project as developped within OSF. The web site
mentionning information is at http://www.gr.opengroup.org/mklinux/hppa/mkpa-
rel.html. Links to more parisc ports are at http://parisc.workstations.org/.

3.2.4. The IA-64 range

HP has developed in collaboration with Intel a new generation of 64 bits
processors called Itanium (IA-64). The first processor of this new generation,
called Itanium, was born in September 2001. The initial port of Linux on IA-64
was published the 2nd of february, 2000 and the sources of the project are
available through ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ports/ia64. This is the
place of the latest sources for this project. More information on this topic
may be found on these pages: http://www.hp.com/products1/linux/itanium/
index.html (LSO), http://devresource.hp.com/devresource/Topics/IA64/IA64.html
and http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/index.html (HP Labs) or on the reference
site http://www.linuxia64.org
HP, as a founding member of the IA-64 Linux project, works on the port of the
kernel, the initial version of gcc, gas, ld and emacs. Another major
contribution of HP to this project is the availability of the software
development kit available at http://www.software.hp.com/ia64linux. It allows to
develop applications as well as kernel code on Linux/IA32 for IA64 platforms
and moreover to test them through a simulator.
You may find some useful tools for IA-64 architecture on the ftp site of the HP
labs.
Debian has accepted IA-64 as a supported architecture for the upcoming Debian
GNU/Linux 3.0 (woody) stable release. Cf: http://www.debian.org/ports/ia64/.
The IA-64 installer CD image is now available by either HTTP or FTP from these
locations: http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz and ftp://
gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz.
MandrakeSoft has announced that its Mandrake 8.1 for IA-64 version supports
perfectly HP Itanium configurations as related on http://www.mandrakesoft.com/
company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1444en=en
The following key features which are all unique to IA-64 are described by
Stéphane Eranian:

* IA-64/EPIC goes beyond pure VLIW. Code is portable from one implementation to
  another. The timing dependencies are protected by stop bits. This allow
  unmodified code to run with no recompilation. Of course better performance is
  achieved by recompilation.
* Very large register set: 128 floating point, 128 general registers.
* Predication: a very elegant way of removing the cost of branch in if-then-
  else statments.
* Speculation: a elegant mechanism to hide memory access latency by allowing
  load instructions to be hoisted from the location where they are needed
  without risking unwanted faults (like NULL pointer).
* Register Stack Engine: a mechanism similar to the register window found a
  SPARC but much more powerful and dynamic. The window size varies on demand.
  Take advantage of the large register set and is used on function calls.
* Hardware support for software pipelined-loop: this is the most powerful
  construct which takes advantages of : predication, large registers. This is a
  renaming scheme for general, floating point or predication registers which
  allows one to unroll loops without incuring the code expansion seen on other
  architectures.
* All the multmedia-type instructions are support in IA-64 mode.
* IA-32 hardware emulation: possibility to run unmodified Linux/ia32
  applications on Linux/ia64 (requires some OS support).
* On the system level: full 64 bit address space. Hardware walker to TLB
  misses.
* Banked registers (16 of them) to help speed up interrupt processing.

Stéphane Eranian and David Mosberger will publish begining of 2002 a book
called 'Design and implementation of the Linux/ia64 kernel' (Prentice Hall)

David Mosberger reports that recent versions (7.2) of Red Hat install a GPT
partition and that you must enable the following two config options for the
kernel to recognize them:

3.2.5. X Terminals

HP proposes now NCD X terminals to replace the Envizex/Entria range.
The HP X terminal range (Entria, Envizex) is usable with a Linux server. More
over, a Linux server may be a boot server for X terminals. To do it, a certain
number of operations are mandatory.
We suppose we have a HP-UX machine named hpux, on which is installed Enware, a
Linux server, named linux and an X Terminal with MAC address 08:00:09:db:8d:1c.
The gateway on the network is at IP address 192.168.1.254, and the DNS name
server at 192.168.1.1.
Commands to do are :

3.2.6. The printing product range


3.2.6.1. General points

Printers may be connected directly to a machine through either a parallel port
(generally), or a serial port, or even (more recently) through a USB port. They
may also be directly wired to the network, for a global access; this is done
thanks to a card put in a slot of the printer, or through the connexion of the
parallel port of the printer to a sharing network box.
HP provides such boxes, called JetDirect, which allow thus to share personnal
printers on the network, directly, without going through a machine. They exist
for various network topologies (10 BT, 10/100 BT, Localtalk, 10B2) and offer
the ability to access to the printer directly from machine which like Linux
support the LPD protocol, by using a remote printer in the /etc/printcap file.
The name of the queue to use is then raw.
An example of /etc/printcap file allowing to access to a printer, equiped with
such a box or card, named lj4000 on the network is given below :
 _________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                         |
|  # REMOTE POSTSCRIPT 1200x1200 a4 {} PostScript Default {}              |
|                                                                         |
|  lj4000::sd=/var/spool/lpd/lj4000::rm=lj4000::rp=raw::if=/var/spool/lpd/|
|  lj4000/filter::mx#0::sh:                                               |
|_________________________________________________________________________|

The configuration access to the box is done either through the WebJetAdminHP
WebJetAdmin tool provided also under Linux now, or by the telnet command. The
default address of these products is 192.0.0.192. To connect to them initially,
you just have to add an IP alias on your network interface, typically by :
 ____________________________
|                            |
|  #ifconfig eth0:0 192.0.0.1|
|____________________________|

and a route to that network (if not automatically created) typically by :
 ___________________________
|                           |
|  #route add -net 192.0.0.0|
|___________________________|

The access to the equipment is thus done simply by :
 _____________________
|                     |
|  #telnet 192.0.0.192|
|_____________________|

Please pay attention to have only one such equipment on the network, at the
same time, or you'll have duplicate IP addresses, which always causes problems.
Note that HP manageable network equipments also use the same default address.
The reading of the IP_Alias_mini_HOWTO may be useful if you don't understand
the previous paragraph :-).
It is of course possible to access through the network to an HP printer
attached and declared directly on a Linux machine, thanks to the lpd service
for the other Unix clients, through SaMBa for the clients of Microsoft systems
(Win9x ou WinNTx) or through NetAtalk for the MacIntosh clients.
At last, SaMBa offers a tool, smbclient, which allows to print from a Unix/
Linux machine to a printer wired directly on a Microsoft based PC, without any
need to use a JetDirect system. All the details useful to realize this
operation are described in the example file of smbprint provided with the SaMBa
package and on the page http://www.medasys-digital-systems.fr/linux/samba-
truc.html.
Communication between a Linux machine and a printer needs also, outside a
network dialog, a discussion with an exchange language between the two
elements. There are a lot of languages of that sort, such as PCL, Postscript or
HPGL. To be able to print correctly, the tool providing the datas to print has
to generate code known by the printer. Filters exist which allow to easily
transform an output in one given format to another one. Thus the Ghostscript
software authorizes the transformation of Postscript source in a great variety
of output formats, as indicated by its invocation in the 'Available devices'
part :

A FAQ dedicated to HP scanners support under Linux with SANE is available at
the address : http://www.kirchgessner.net/sanehpfaq.html
Some usefull adresses for USB scanners should be consulted : http://
www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html and http://www.qbik.ch/usb/
devices/search_res.php3?pattern=hp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.7.2. Digital photo cameras

To use these peripherals, you have to compile SCSI support with your kernel,
and turn on mass storage device in USB support. Then mount the /dev/sdxx device
as usual.
The following table provides all information on the support for this hardware
by Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.7.3. The Digital Sender

This product is a scanner, able to send the result of the digitalisation
through e-mail, by sending the digitalised document as an attachement in PDF
format. It may so well be used with a Linux (or other) mail server (sendmail,
postfix, ...), as well as with clients reading their messages under Linux,
providing they have a tool to display PDF file such as Acrobat_Reader or xpdf.
The Digital Sender can also send images as black and white or colour TIFF
files. The black and white images work fine, however, there is a problem with
the coloured TIFF files. These are sent in an obsolete format which is not
supported by libtiff, which is the basis of support for the TIFF format for
nearly all Linux software. This means that you cannot directly open colour TIFF
images created by the Digital Sender using Linux software (e.g. The GIMP,
ImageMagick).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.7.4. The CapShare

THere is an application for the Window Maker window manager to manage the
CapShare. More information at http://www.netjunki.org/projects/index.php
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.8. All-in-one range (OfficeJet)

These products gather many functions : printing (all), scanning (all), copying
(all), and faxing (some).
More information from their dedicated web site : http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/
suplist.shtml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.9. The Storage products range


3.2.9.1. Tape based products

Most HP SCSI tape drives (DAT 1, 2, 3, 4, DLT, LTO) work with Linux. the driver
file to use is /dev/st0 for the first drive, /dev/st1, for the second...
More information may be found on the certification site http://
www.linuxtapecert.org/
HP provides the tapeware software with its drives, including a Linux version.
Colorado Trakker 250 and 350 are supported with ftape (>= 4.02) T1000 should
also work correctly. Colorado 5GB are supported with the paride driver.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.9.1.1. HP libraries

Tools to manage such drives may be found on http://mtx.sourceforge.net/ or
http://www.arkeia.com/ or http://www.strusel007.de/linux/changer.html. I had
the chance to test models 6x24, 418, 718, 818 with arkeia without problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.9.2. HP SureStore Virtual Array

These systems are supported in a mixed environment Windows NT/2K, HP-UX 11.0
and Linux. They are connected through Fibre Channel controlers to the SAN.
Among all FC cards supported on Linux, HP supoprts those provided by Emulex and
QLogic. HP sells a Linux version of the management software for these arrays.
Supported models are VA7100 (A6183A), VA7400.

|_____________________________________________________________________________|

Khalid Aziz reports that there may be a problem with XP512 support of Linux due
to a hole in LUN numbers. If the LUNs were numbered continuously, you would see
all LUNs. Some folks in HP have written patches for this. Essentially all that
is needed is to add an entry in device_list[] in scsi_scan.c for the XP512 and
set the flag BLIST_SPARSELUN. The entry would look something like:
 ________________________________________
|                                        |
|  { "HP", "XP512", "*", BLIST_SPARSELUN}|
|________________________________________|

The first field is the vendor name as reported by XP512 and second field is the
model name as reported by XP512. These two need to match what XP512 returns in
Inquiry command, exactly.

Chapter 4. Solutions and Sizing

This chapter proposes an help for sizing NetServers under Linux, depending on
the different kind of use.
You have to consider that exercise as a bit perilous. Indeed, only the reality
allows to test such previsions. Nevertheless, using the experience acquired by
deploying solutions in the past, we can give some useful rules.
We may apply a certain number of rules valid for the sizing of classical Unix
servers, considering that CISC systems (the majority in Linux environment) need
2.5 less times resources in memory than RISC systems, due to the fact that
binaries used are smaller (Intel platforms are for the moment 32 bits
architectures). This has also influences on disk and swap space.
It's obvious you have to consider, whatever the system, bottlenecks of the
solution put in place, because they will determine the weakest link in the
chain.
You have to look particularly at the following points :

* The number and the speed of disks (the I/O rate of 10.000 rpm disks may go up
  to 20 MB/s, and 25 for 15.000 rpm disks),
* The number and the speed of SCSI controlers (the I/O rate of Ultra2 LVD of
  the LC2000 - LH3/4/3000/6000 may go up to 80 MB/s, and latest B model up to
  160 MB/s),
* The addition of a supplementary SCSI card supported, when adding slow
  peripherals (DAT, DLT, CD writer ...) in order to avoid that the controler
  slow down in compatible mode, and that I/O performances drop significantly.

You have also to be suspicious of the extensible functions of machines. Indeed,
it's often better for a customer to add a new server, rather than to increase
the capacities of the one in place. The first reason is a financial one, on one
side, because the costs of add-ons on an already old system may be near those
of a new system, whose prices are becoming cheaper and cheaper. And the same
for maintenance. On the other hand, technically, it could be more interesting
to benefit from the latest technologies to obtain a machine more equilibrate,
powerful and to reuse the old one for secondary tasks (secondary DNS, ...) or
to split processes from the other one. For example, when Ultra2 LVD was
introduced, it was more interesting to buy a new server to benefit from the 80
MB/s SCSI bus speed, rather than to update a server which had 40 MB/s Ultra
Wide SCSI. This implies that it's interesting to size correctly the server,
from the begining, for the whole forseeable period of life of its use
(typically 3 years nowadays).
In the same kind of ideas, you have to examine closely the choice between a bi-
processors and two mono-processors machines. 2 different systems imply 2 disk
controlers, 2 disks set, 2 separate RAM busses thus better performances, but
more administration. On the other hand, a unique system renders it easier,
allows for a quicker communication between processors, which could be necessary
for certain applications, but makes the environment more fragile (more downtime
in case of an hardware problem). In fact, there are more losses intrinsically
on a multi-processor model, in communications at the system level. This
question should mainly be considered for the addition of a processor
(necesseraly obsolete) on a machine a posteriori, rather than to add a new
server.
On memory aspects, Linux can manage today up to 64 GB in stable kernels. Linux
takes the maximum from the memory you give to it, mainly by the constitution of
a cache disk which improves greatly system performances. You may thus oversize
the quantity of RAM installed, because it's preferable to a situation where the
server would be forced to swap (which drop performances dramatically). The
minimum RAM size provided on the NetServers (128 ou 256 MB) matches perfectly a
normal use of a system, and doesn't need any particular addition. You have to
take in account that there is no graphical environment used on production
servers. Concerning the swap, under Linux, it comes in addition to the RAM to
give the complete virtual memory available for the server. As a base rule, it's
recommanded to give the same amount of swap space as the amount of RAM, to
allow the system to put on disk nearly all the running processes in case of
need. But the rule which exists for System V Unix (such as HP-UX) consisting of
reserving twice the amount of RAM for swap isn't useful under Linux. You may
note that Linux may swap certain inactive processes to free the maximum RAM
possible. So having a system whose swap is partially used isn't necesseraly a
proof of lack of memory, nor lack of performances.
You'll find below recommandations depending of the type of use made by the HP
NetServer under Linux. It's possible to cumulate several functions on the same
server. You'll take care to add at least in that case the resources needed to
give the services.
Some generic rules have to be considered :

* We consider that the number of simultaneous users is the same as half the
  whole number of users on the server.
* The minimal RAM size needed for a usable Linux server is 32 MB, which is less
  than the minimum amount of RAM available on the NetServers (128 MB). In case
  you use X-Window with KDE or Gnome on this machine, you need to have 64 MB in
  supplement, thus 96 MB as a minimum.
* The minimal disk size needed for a usable Linux server is 2 GB, which is less
  than the minimum amount of disk available on the NetServers (9 GB).
* In case of use of Raid 1, you have to double the amount of disk space useful
  to obtain the disk space needed. In case of use of Raid 5, you need to add 1
  disk to obtain the disk space needed (up to 8 disks).
* Except in particular cases (computing server), the amount of swap is the same
  as the amount of RAM.
* The minimal processor needed for a usable Linux server is a Pentium 133,
  which is less than the minimum processor available on the NetServers (Pentium
  III 933).
* Each X-Window user excuting a client on the server uses in average 2 MB.
* It may be useful to add network cards in this type of machine to smooth the
  traffic, depending on the number of clients. Using the bonding option
  provided by the Linux kernel may also be very useful.

4.1. Linux as file and print server


4.1.1. Linux as file server

The sharing service uses 2 MB of RAM, and 2 more MB per share. In case of a
unique share (users space for example), it leads to a 2 MB consumption per
user. In the proposed case, we estimate that each user has 100 MB of disk space
on the server, with an evolution to 200 MB 3 years later. Processor resources
used are relativeley small, an entry level model will be sufficient from that
point of view. We will priviledge the I/O speed with Ultra 3 LVD SCSI at 160
MB/s, if the budget allows it, and 15.000 RPM disks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.2. Linux as print server

The sharing service uses 2 MB of RAM, and 2 more MB per printer shared. In case
of a unique share (One printer per user typically), it leads to a 2 MB
consumption per user. In the proposed case, we estimate that each user prints
simultaneously files of 5 MB in average, thus we need to have that space
available on the server. Processor resources used are relativeley small, an
entry level model will be sufficient from that point of view.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2. Internet/Intranet Linux server


4.2.1. Web Server

The Web service uses 2.5 MB of RAM, in static mode (simple HTML pages) and 5 MB
of RAM in dynamic mode (HTML pages generated from perl, PHP, ...) per user. The
disk space needed is function of the nature of the server, knowing that most of
the consumption comes from images. Processor resources used are important, thus
it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency and the addition of
processors, because this type of traffic could be quite well done in parallel.
With Apache 2.0 and the support of threads, it will become even more obvious.
We will priviledge also the I/O speed with Ultra 2 LVD SCSI at 80 MB/s, if the
budget allows it, and 10.000 RPM disks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.2. Mail Server

Generally, this machine is used as both SMTP (sending and reception of
messages) and POP/IMAP server (keeper of messages and manager of client
accesses). The SMTP Mail service uses 2 MB of RAM per user. The POP/IMAP Mail
service uses 2 MB of RAM per user. The disk space needed becomes more and more
important as long as attachments (images, various documents) take the greatest
place in exchanges via e-mail. We consider in that case that an average mail
box size is 50 MB. Processor resources used are important, thus it could be
useful to consider the increase in frequency and the addition of processors,
because this type of traffic could be quite well done in parallel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.3. Firewall/Proxy/Web-Cache server

Generally, this machine is both a Firewall server, a proxy (in both directions)
and a cache for the Web because all requests go through it. The Firewall
service uses 1 MB of RAM. The Proxy service uses 0.3 MB per incoming relay. The
Web cache service uses 0.5 MB per user. The disk space needed is function of
the parameters of the cache Web server. In that case, we consider 20 MB per
user. Processor resources used are important, due to the analysis of IP
packets. Thus it could be useful to consider the increase in frequency.

|500_-_1000________|1_GB____|27_GB____|E800___________|

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.4. Directory server

Generally, this machine use a software like OpenLDAP to fulfill its goals. The
LDAP service uses 1 MB of RAM and 10 kB of RAM per user. The disk space needed
is of the same kind, so 10 kB per user. Processor resources used are moderated.

|500_-_1000________|128_MB__|9_GB_____|E800___________|

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. Linux as computing server

Generally, this machine is extremely stressed, mainly on the processor and RAM
aspects. Sometimes this is combined with intensive I/O needs. We thus equip
such a machine with high-end processors (nowadays Pentium III Xeon) with the
greatest level 2 cache possible (nowadays 2 MB). In RAM, we would tend to reach
the maximum possible, thus 4 GB. For this type of server, we should adapt the
swap such as it covers all the needs in memory required by the computing codes
to execute. There is often no specific constraint on network performances,
except in case of a computing cluster, in which case we may consider to equip
the machines with 100 Mb/s cards with a switch between them, even with Myrinet,
Dolphin or Gigabit products. Typically, a LP1000 2*PIII 1.4GHz 1 GB/2*9GB is
the target of this type of server. The choice is extremely variable depending
on the nature of the computation to do. We should underline that there are
processors, such as PA-Risc, much more performant in floating point computation
than today Intel processors (up to 6 times). The new IA-64 Itanium family seems
also to bring a better compromise for price/performances for that environment.
This is by the way not the only approach as shown by the i-cluster project. Cf:
http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2001/HPL-2001-206.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4. Linux as an office server

This kind of server is for the moment rare in the free software world. It's
more frequent in Microsoft world, by association with Metaframe solutions of
Citrix. An office server needs 50 MB of RAM per user. Intrinsically, this
machine has no requirements in term of disk, if it's not at the same time a
file server. Processor resources used are important, thus it could be useful to
consider the increase in frequency and the addition of processors, because this
type of traffic could be quite well done in parallel.

 Read Wonderful_World_of_Linux_2.2 or the_same_in_french.
5.2."What's new in kernel 2.4 ?"
 Read Wonderful_World_of_Linux_2.4.
5.3."How to have more than 1 GB of RAM on my NetServer ?"
 The following information are adapted from the page of Rik van Riel. They
concern 2.0.x as well as 2.2.x kernels, and 2.4.x.
First of all, the IA32 Intel architecture is limited by construction in its
memory management to 4 GB. Space which should be divided into virtual memory
and physical memory. Which means that if you choose to recognize more RAM, the
maximum size for a program decreases.
But Linux can't manage more than 1 GB by default. To go above that, in fact up
to 2 GB today, because Linux can't manage more memory for the moment, you need
to modify 2 files provided with kernel sources and recompile it. Those 2
sources are /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386/page.h and /usr/src/linux/arch/
i386/vmlinux.lds.
From 2.0.37 and 2.2.12 kernels on, the patch was integrated in the kernel and
may be activated when doing a make {menu,x}config.
The maximum Ram managed in the i386 version was ported to 64 GB after 2.3.23.
5.4."How to have more than 128 MB of swap on my NetServer ?"
 Up to the version 2.8x of the util-linux package, the mkswap command could
create swap partitions only up to 128 MB maximum. You then had to create as
much partitions as necessary. Till the 2.9 version, included in standard in
RedHat 6.0 and following distributions, it's possible to create directly swap
partitions up to 2 GB and to 8 partitions.
5.5."How to use the other procesors of my NetServer ?"
 Multi-processing is supported by Linux operationnaly till the 2.0 version of
the kernel. For a 2.0.x kernel, you have to recompile it and set up the SMP
variable in the Makefile to 1. For a 2.2.x or 2.4.x kernel, you have to set it
up during the make {menu,x}config. For more details, please consult the SMP-
HOWTO.
5.6."Is Linux Y2K compatible ?"
 Generally, Linux is Y2K compatible. For more information please consult the
FAQ.
5.7."How to increase the number of processes managed by the kernel ?"
 For 2.2.x kernels, you need to edit the file /usr/src/linux/include/linux/
tasks.h, modify the value of the constant NR_TASKS (512 by default) and set it
to a value which doesn't exceed 4092 or 4090 if APM is configured. It could be
useful to set MAX_TASKS_PER_USER at the same time to an appropriate value. Then
recompile the kernel as usual.
5.8."How to increase the number of loopback devices managed by the kernel ?"
 You need to edit the file /usr/src/linux/drivers/block/loop.c, For 2.2.x
kernels, you need to modify the value of the constant MAXLOOP (8 by default).
For 2.4.x kernels, you need to modify the value of the static int max_loop
variable. Then recompile the kernel as usual.
5.9."How to have files bigger than 2 GB on ext2 ?"
 You need to have a kernel 2.4.x, glibc 2.1.3 at least and that all necessary
tools have been recompiled. Look at http://www.suse.de/~aj/linux_lfs.html

Appendix A. GNU Free Documentation License

Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
     Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
     and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
     it is not allowed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is
not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed
by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member
of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or
a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-
Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose
contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic
text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in
covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with
each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the
Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has
access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
provide you with an updated version of the Document.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:

  a. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
     that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
     if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You
     may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
     that version gives permission.
  b. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
     together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
     of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
  c. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
     as the publisher.
  d. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
  e. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
     other copyright notices.
  f. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
     the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
     License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
  g. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
     required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
  h. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
  i. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
     item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
     Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
     entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
     authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
     add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
  j. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
     access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
     locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
     These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
     location for a work that was published at least four years before the
     Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
     gives permission.
  k. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the
     section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
     each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
  l. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
     text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
     considered part of the section titles.
  m. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
     included in the Modified Version.
  n. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
     title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
titles.
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but
endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts
in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-
Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If
the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that
you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the
original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
combined work in its license notice.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a
compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the
Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the
Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers
around the whole aggregate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the original
English version will prevail.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free
Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license
     is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead
of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write "no
Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for
Back-Cover Texts.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
software.
