<H1>UMSDOS HOW-TO</H1>

<HR>
<EM>    <EM>Umsdos</EM> is a linux file system. It provide an alternative
        to the <EM>EXT2</EM> file-system. Its main goal is to achieve
        easier coexistence with <EM>Ms-DOS</EM> data by sharing the same
        partition.
        This document explain first how to use Umsdos in different
        configuration, and later explain its operation and try to
        provide some information letting you decide if it is
        a good choice for you (see UMSDOS-WHY-TO at the end).</EM>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 History</A>
</H2>


<P>The <EM>Umsdos</EM> project was started in 1992 and made available
to the net in January 1994 as a patch. It was included in the standard
kernel distribution in July, starting with kernel 1.1.36.</P>
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> was early adopted in the <EM>Slackware</EM> distribution
even before it was officially included in the official kernel.</P>
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> was improved starting at kernel 1.1.60. Its performance
has been dramatically enhanced, especially for writing. Since 1.1.70
(around this), it is stable again.</P>
<P>A major bug was solve in <EM>Linux</EM> 1.2.2. This bug was causing
some grief to users since the beginning (some file were
silently renamed, giving the sad impression that they were
deleted). Beware that <EM>Slackware</EM> 2.2 is still shipping
release 1.2.1 of the kernel, so has this bug.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Availability</A>
</H2>


<P>It is available as a patch for kernel 1.0.x. It is built-in
for kernel 1.2. It can be compiled in or load as a module.
Beware that for now, if you intend to load <EM>umsdos</EM> as a module,
you must also use the Ms-DOS fs as a module. This come from
a limitation in the module system (some symbols are only
export when the drivers is installed as a module).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Distribution supporting it</A>
</H2>


<P>So far, I think only <EM>Slackware</EM> does support it. I am surely
wrong, so please send me info to correct this.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Home site</A>
</H2>


<P>The home site for <EM>Umsdos</EM> is sunsite.unc.edu. Look in
the directory <CODE>/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/umsdos</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Technical documentation</A>
</H2>

<P>There is quite a lot of documentation about the internal of
<EM>Umsdos</EM>. It is available both in <CODE>HTML</CODE> and text format
at the same location as the utilities.</P>
<P>As far as I know, the <CODE>HTML</CODE> version is not available online
on any web site. You must down-load it and "UN-tar" it and
read it locally.</P>

</H2>

<P>With <EM>Umsdos</EM>, <EM>Linux</EM> can be installed in a standard
DOS partition. <EM>Linux</EM> is then installed as a second (or
third) OS in the partition. To avoid name collision (there
is maybe a bin or tmp directory in the drive C: already),
<EM>Umsdos</EM> use
a smart trick: The pseudo-root.</P>
<P>All <EM>Linux</EM> files are installed in a DOS subdirectory
called <CODE>linux</CODE>, generally <CODE>C: LINUX</CODE>. The normal
<EM>Linux/Unix</EM> directory structure goes there. So you

<LI> This mode can only be triggered

<LI> This mechanism is purely a different view of a normal

used as a root partition can be normally mounted. There won't
be any pseudo-root effect.

For example, if you boot linux with a maintenance floppy and
mount your normal root partition in <CODE>/mnt</CODE>, you will
find all your linux directory in
<CODE>/mnt/linux/bin, /mnt/linux/etc</CODE> and so on.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Different topics about the operation of <EM>Umsdos</EM></A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Mount option</A>
</H2>


<P>You can use the same mount option as for the Ms-DOS file system.
The option conv= is questionable on a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system. I suggest
to avoid it. Mostly the option you may want to look at are</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>uid=</LI>
<LI>gid=</LI>
<LI>umask=</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Just remember that <EM>Umsdos</EM> manage non promoted directory
the same way as the <EM>Ms-DOS</EM> file system. The option above
will apply globally to all non promoted directory. <EM>uid</EM>
setup the default owner, <EM>gid</EM> setup the default group
and <EM>umask</EM> setup the default permissions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 How to set defaults for the root</A>
</H2>


<P>umssetup was created to provide at run time default ownership
for the root partition. For other <EM>Umsdos</EM> partition, mount
option may be used or umssetup. Storing mount option in /etc/fstab
is the prefered way for non root partition. Here is an example.
Put this in     /etc/rc.d/rc.S.</P>
<P>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 To swap or not to swap</A>
</H2>


<P>Using a swap file is generally slower than a swap partition.
It is however much more flexible. You can setup a swap file
in a <EM>Umsdos</EM> partition the same way you do it for any
other <EM>Linux</EM> file systems. For example, to setup a
8 megabytes swap file in the root directory:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k count=8 of=/swap
                mkswap /swap 8192
                sync
                swapon /swap
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Once done, you can put the following line in /etc/fstab</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>And the swap file will be activated at each boot (There is
generally a "swapon -a" in <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.S</CODE>).</P>

<P>The package lodlin15.tgz available from sunsite.unc.edu

</H2>


<P>Booting a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system from a floppy is not different from
booting a <EM>Ext2</EM> system. You need a kernel zImage file properly
initialize to locate your root <EM>Umsdos</EM> partition. This
is generally achieved using the command <CODE>rdev</CODE>. The following
sequence will initialize a zImage and put it on a floppy.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 LILO</A>
</H2>


<P>LILO, the official <EM>Linux</EM> boot loader can also be used
to boot a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system. I have no experience with it
though. Since 1.1.60, it should work. Please email if you know
something.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 How to defragment a <EM>Umsdos</EM> partition</A>
</H2>


<P>It can be done using any popular DOS tool. There is nothing
particular about file produced by <EM>Umsdos</EM>. And <EM>Umsdos</EM>
do not expect anything particular (directory layout, directory
entry sequence, etc...) from the file system under it.</P>
<P>As far as I know, there is no <EM>Linux</EM> tool to achieve this.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Advance tricks</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> rely on the <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE> which rely on the
<EM>DOS</EM> directory. Some users may want to experiment
a bit. The utility <CODE>udosctl</CODE> part of the umsdos_progs
package (containing <CODE>umssync</CODE> and <CODE>umssetup</CODE>) allows
basic directory operation (listing, deletion) independently
on the <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE> and the <EM>DOS</EM> directory.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Basic principle</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>


<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> map <EM>Linux</EM> files directly to <EM>Ms-DOS</EM> files.
This is a one for one translation. File content is not manipulated
at all. <EM>Umsdos</EM> only works on names. For special files (links
and devices for example), it introduces special management.</P>
<P>For each directory, there is a file named <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 <EM>Umsdos</EM> can replace the <EM>Ms-DOS</EM> file-system.</A>
</H2>


<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> can be thought as a general purpose superset
of the <EM>Ms-DOS</EM> file system of linux. In fact this
capability or flexibility yields much confusion about
<EM>Umsdos</EM>. Here is why. Try to mount a newly formatted
<EM>DOS</EM> floppy like this.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mount -t umsdos /dev/fd0 /mnt
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>And do this,</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ls / >/mnt/LONGFILENAME
        ls -l /mnt
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will get the following result</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>So far, it seems that the <EM>Umsdos</EM> file system does not do
much more (in fact nothing at all) than the normal <EM>Ms-DOS</EM>
file system of <EM>Linux</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>???</EM></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Directory promotion</A>
</H2>


<P>Pretty unimpressive so far. Here is the trick. Unless promoted
a <EM>DOS</EM> directory will be managed the same way with <EM>Umsdos</EM>
than the <EM>Ms-DOS</EM> file-system will. <EM>Umsdos</EM> use a special
file in each subdirectory to achieve the translation between
the extended capabilities (long name, ownership, etc...) of
<EM>Umsdos</EM> and the limitation of the <EM>DOS</EM> file-system.
This file is invisible to <EM>Umsdos</EM> users, but visible when
you boot <EM>DOS</EM>. To avoid cluttering the <EM>DOS</EM> partition
with those file (<CODE>--linux-.---</CODE>) uselessly, the file is now
optional. If absent, <EM>Umsdos</EM> behave like <EM>Ms-DOS</EM>.</P>
<P>When a directory is promoted, any subsequent operation will be
done with the full semantic normally available to <EM>Unix</EM> and
<EM>Linux</EM> users. And all subdirectory created afterward will
be silently promoted.</P>
<P>This feature allows you to logically organize your <EM>DOS</EM> partition
into <EM>DOS</EM> stuff and <EM>Linux</EM> stuff. It is important to
understand that those <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE> file do take some place
(generally 2k per directory). <EM>DOS</EM> generally use large
cluster (as big as 16k for a 500meg partition), so avoiding
putting <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE> everywhere can save your day.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 How to promote: <CODE>/sbin/umssync</CODE></A>
</H2>


<P>A directory can be promoted any time using <CODE>/sbin/umssync</CODE>.
It can be used at any time. Promoting a directory do the
following operation</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Establish a one to one relation between the <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE>
and the current content of the directory.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><CODE>/sbin/umssync</CODE> maintain an existing <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE> file.
It does not create it from scratch all the time. It simply add
missing entries in it (Files created during a <EM>DOS</EM> session).
It will also removed files which do not exist anymore in the
<EM>DOS</EM> directory from the <EM>--linux-.---</EM>. <CODE>umssync</CODE> gets
its name from that. It put <EM>--linux-.---</EM> in sync with
the underlying <EM>DOS</EM> directory.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Using <CODE>/sbin/umssync</CODE> at boot time</A>
</H2>

<P>It is a good idea to place a call to <CODE>/sbin/umssync</CODE>
at the end of your /etc/rc.d/rc.S if it's not there. The following
command is adequate for most system:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        /sbin/umssync -r99 -c -i+ /
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>-c</CODE> option prevent <CODE>umssync</CODE> from promoting
directories. It will only update existing <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE>.</P>
<P>This command is useful if you access <EM>Linux</EM> directory during
a <EM>DOS</EM> session. <EM>Linux</EM> has no efficient way to tell that
a directory has been modified by <EM>DOS</EM> so <EM>Umsdos</EM> can't
do a <EM>umssync</EM> operation as needed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 How to UN-promote</A>
</H2>


<P>Remove the <CODE>--linux-.---</CODE> file using <EM>DOS</EM>. You will
be sorry.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 What about files created during a <EM>DOS</EM> session ?</A>
</H2>


<P>Unless you use <CODE>umssync</CODE> on a directory where files have
been added or removed by <EM>DOS</EM>, you will notice some problems:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It won't crash the system nor it won't cause major
problems, only annoyance :-)</LI>
<LI>Files created by <EM>DOS</EM>.
<UL>
<LI>They will be invisible in <EM>Linux</EM>.</LI>
<LI>When trying to create a file with the same name,
you will get an error message stating that the

<LI>This creates more confusion that real problem. It
does not harm the file system.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Files deleted by <EM>DOS</EM> won't cause problem. <EM>Umsdos</EM>
will notice the absence at the first access. A message
will be output (and generally written into
<CODE>/var/adm/syslog</CODE>).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Installation/UN-installation and some tricks</A></H2>

<P>The installation of a <EM>Umsdos</EM> is not much different
from the installation of an ordinary (<EM>Ext2 based</EM>) <EM>Linux</EM>
system.</P>
<P>There are two main differences.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 The pseudo-root <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>The normal steps for an installation are</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Setting a partition with fdisk and formatting it.</LI>
<LI>Mounting it as /mnt relative to our installation
root disk.</LI>
<LI>Copy all packages into <CODE>/mnt</CODE>.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>With <EM>Umsdos</EM>, the step 1 is not required (wasn't it the goal
of <EM>Umsdos</EM> not to reformat ?).</P>
<P>It is possible to install a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system just by copying
all packages into <CODE>/mnt</CODE>. This will certainly work. But it
will create a
bunch of subdirectories into your <EM>DOS</EM> root directory (C:) and
you won't like it. This is the reason all <EM>Umsdos</EM> installation
use the pseudo-root. And this is the major difference between
a normal <EM>Ext2</EM> installation and a <EM>Umsdos</EM> one: All files
are copied into <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Preparing <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P><CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE> is not an ordinary directory. It has to
be promoted so it will correctly handle <EM>Linux</EM> long file name
and special files (links, device). The step required to
setup <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE> are:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI><CODE>mkdir /mnt/linux</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>umssync /mnt/linux</CODE></LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>That's it!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Making sure <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE> is correctly setup</A>
</H2>

<P>Even if the setup of <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE> is pretty simple, there
are many installation package out there who get it wrong. How can ?</P>
<P>The biggest installation problem come from an incompatible
<CODE>umssync</CODE> program. <EM>Umsdos</EM> has been update in
linux 1.1.88 (Can't remember exactly) and a flaw was uncovered
in <CODE>umssync</CODE>. To avoid confusion in the <EM>Linux</EM>
community, it was decided to raise the compatibility
level required for all <EM>Umsdos</EM> tools. Old version
of the tools were simply rejected.</P>
<P>It sounds like many distribution did not update their
<CODE>umssync</CODE> utility on the installation disk.</P>
<P>There are still many distribution like this out there. The net result
is that the directory <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE> is not promoted at all
and will truncate all long file name and will reject all special
file.</P>
<P>It is possible to do a test very early during the installation to
find out if something went wrong. Thanks to the pseudo console
mechanism of <EM>Linux</EM>, you can do that without leaving the
installation program. Do the following steps:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Press <CODE>Alt-F2</CODE> (<CODE>Alt</CODE> key at the same time
as the <CODE>F2</CODE> key).</LI>
<LI>login as root.</LI>
<LI><CODE>cd /mnt/linux</CODE>

If this fail, you are trying this too early. A good time
to do this is at the end of the packages selection.</LI>
<LI><CODE>>TOTO</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>ls -l</CODE>

You should see an empty file <CODE>TOTO</CODE> in uppercase. If you
see it in lowercase, something went wrong. Try to do
the <CODE>umssync</CODE> step again. <CODE>umssync</CODE> can be use over
and over without problem.

<CODE>umssync .</CODE>

If there is no error message, try the <CODE>TOTO</CODE> test again.
If
<CODE>TOTO</CODE> appears fine, then all is OK. Something is strange
in this installation, but you just save it. Continue
                </LI>
<LI>Press <CODE>Alt-F1</CODE> to get back to the installation screen.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>If the test fail, the best fix is to get a newer installation
root disk. You can generally fix this root disk by installing
a newer version of <CODE>umssync</CODE>. This is not difficult but
required a working <EM>Linux</EM> system. You simply have to
mount the root disk floppy and replace the offending
<CODE>umssync</CODE> with a new one.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Oops releasing pseudo root ...</A>
</H2>

<P>Most <EM>Umsdos</EM> installation which fail, do this by printing
this strange message. This is not a bug in <EM>Umsdos</EM> although
the message looks strange. Here are the known causes.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The most common one
<P>The <EM>Slackware</EM> installation try to setup a swap
file very early during the installation. To do so, it asks
you to select a partition (dos drive), then mount it and
set the swap file.</P>
<P>When installing a <EM>Slackware</EM> system, you must setup
the target partition prior to install. This normally
mounts the <EM>DOS</EM> partition on <CODE>/mnt</CODE>, creates
the <CODE>/mnt/linux</CODE> directory and applies <CODE>umssync</CODE>
on it.</P>
<P>This is where most problems come from. Most user just
forget the "setup target partition" step and go directly
to the rest of the installation. Since <CODE>/mnt</CODE> is

<LI>Old bug in umsdos
<P>There was a bug in <EM>Umsdos</EM> prior to <EM>Linux 1.2.2</EM>. The

in <CODE>/sbin</CODE>. You can fix it by getting a newer kernel.
This is recommended because another bug was uncover and fixed

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 How to UN-install a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system</A>
</H2>

<P>One neat thing about <EM>Umsdos</EM> and its pseudo-root
mechanism, is that you can UN-install it without pain. You
just boot <EM>DOS</EM> and recursively delete the <CODE>linux</CODE>
directory. That's all. <EM>Umsdos</EM> requires no special
drivers in the config.sys, nor it creates anything
special outside of the <CODE>linux</CODE> directory.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Moving a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system to another <EM>DOS</EM> drive</A>
</H2>

<P>This can be done from <EM>Linux</EM> or from <EM>DOS</EM>.
You just have to copy recursively the <CODE>linux</CODE> directory
from one drive to the other. After that you will have to
adjust you boot mechanism (generally loadlin command) and
the <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> file.</P>
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> can live on any <EM>DOS</EM> drive. There is no
need to install it on the <CODE>C:</CODE> drive, nor it is important
to have it on the first hard drive. It does not matter at
all.</P>
<P>In fact, one may decide to have several <EM>Umsdos</EM> installations
on different drive just to do experiments.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 About installing 50 <EM>Umsdos</EM> systems.</A>
</H2>

<P>How about installing a bunch of <EM>Linux</EM> systems in no time ?</P>
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> systems are living in a <EM>DOS</EM> world. You can
take advantage of this if you wish to install <EM>Linux</EM> easily.</P>
<P>You can install and configure a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system at your site.
When you are satisfied with the configuration and the different
packages you have selected, you can boot <EM>DOS</EM> and copy
the complete <CODE>linux</CODE> directory to your <EM>DOS</EM> file
server. Then you go to other <EM>DOS</EM> station and simply
copy the files on the network drive to the local drive.
That's it. Only adjust the boot script (<EM>Loadlinx</EM>) and go.</P>
<P>With minimal adjustment (Host name, IP number), anyone will
be able to install a <EM>Linux</EM> system in a matter of minute.</P>
<P>Interest readers may note that installing <EM>Linux</EM> systems
by copying running system also works for any other <EM>Linux</EM>
systems, including <EM>Ext2</EM> based one.</P>
<P>One beauty of <EM>Linux</EM> is that there is no hidden files which
have to be install by magic installation program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Setting a <EM>Linux</EM> section in a <EM>DOS</EM> partition</A></H2>

<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> has some use even for <EM>Ext2</EM> (Native <EM>Linux</EM>
file-system) users. One common scenario is this:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>Linux</EM> being your <EM>OS</EM> of choice, the <EM>Linux</EM>
partition start to fill and fill and fill.</LI>
<LI>Your <EM>DOS</EM> partition is collecting dust, being half empty.</LI>
<LI>You are suddenly out of space in the <EM>Ext2</EM> partition.</LI>
<LI>You are still not sure you want to get rid of <EM>DOS</EM>.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> may save the day here. You can setup a <EM>Linux</EM>
directory in the <EM>DOS</EM> partition and use it without restriction
for <EM>Linux</EM> usage. For example, say you want to setup a new
directory named <CODE>"extra"</CODE> in your <CODE>C:</CODE> drive. And you want this
directory to behave as a normal <EM>Linux</EM> directory. Do this
(assuming that C: is /dev/hda1).</P>

<P>You must be root to do this.</P>
<P>By setting up <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> like this, you will always
have access to the <CODE>/c/extra</CODE> directory.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s9">9. UMSDOS-WHY-TO</A></H2>

<P>Explaining how to operate or install a <EM>Umsdos</EM> system
is not enough. Most people are seeking some advises about
using <EM>Umsdos</EM> or not. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 The goal of <EM>Umsdos</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>The goal of <EM>Umsdos</EM> was to ease the installation of
<EM>Linux</EM>. An other goal was to ease its UN-installation.
The idea here was to promote the spreading of <EM>Linux</EM>.
Installing a new OS on a system is always troublesome. <EM>OS/2</EM>
for one will happily pollute your <CODE>C:</CODE> root with a bunch of
new directories. If you are clever like me, it will also erase
your config.sys and autoexec.bat files :-(</P>
<P>The pseudo-root feature of <EM>Umsdos</EM> avoid this unwanted
invasion. <EM>Linux</EM> can be UN-install without side effect. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Who needs it</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have a small hard drive, <EM>Umsdos</EM> will allow you
to share disk space between <EM>DOS</EM> and <EM>Linux</EM>. A disk
below 300 megs is in my opinion a small disk. This opinion
is based on the size of the different package available today.
One popular word processor may eat as much as 70 megabytes
if you select all features.</P>
<P>If you have a larger drive, you may consider having a dedicated
<EM>Linux</EM> partition running the <EM>Ext2</EM> file-system. <EM>Ext2</EM>
use a smaller cluster size that <EM>DOS</EM> (1k in fact) so installing
many small files will eat less space than in a <EM>Umsdos</EM>
partition.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Performance issue</A>
</H2>

<P>The following point apply to <EM>Umsdos</EM> compared with <EM>Ext2</EM>.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Directory management is faster on <EM>Ext2</EM>. This come from
the overhead of the double directory structure of
<EM>Umsdos</EM>.</LI>
<LI>File access (reading and writing) is probably faster on
<EM>Umsdos</EM> than <EM>Ext2</EM>. This come from the simplicity
of the <EM>FAT</EM> file-system used by <EM>DOS</EM>.

Beware that this simplicity come with a cost:

<UL>
<LI>A maximum of around 65,000 files or clusters
per partitions. This also means that a 500
megabytes partition will use cluster 16k large.
In other word, a file containing a single byte
will use 16k of disk storage.</LI>
<LI>Everything is controlled by the <CODE>FAT</CODE> located
at the beginning of the hard drive. The <EM>DOS</EM>
file-system is probably more fragile because of this.</LI>
<LI>No provision to avoid fragmentation of files. A
<EM>Umsdos</EM> system will generally be used as
a single user workstation. In this case, this does
not matter much. As a multi-user engine, files
will get spread-ed all around the drive, lowering
file access performance.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Symbolic links are stored in normal file. If you intend
to have a lot of them, you will find that <EM>Umsdos</EM>
use quite a lot of disk space compared to <EM>Ext2</EM>.</LI>
</UL>
