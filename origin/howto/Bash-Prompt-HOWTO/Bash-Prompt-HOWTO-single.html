>Creating and controlling terminal and xterm prompts is discussed,
including incorporating standard escape sequences to give username, 
current working directory, time, etc.  Further suggestions are made
on how to modify xterm title bars, use external functions to provide
prompt information, and how to use ANSI colours.&#13;</P

>I've been maintaining this document for nearly six years (I believe
the first submitted version was January 1998).  I've received a lot of
e-mail, almost all of it positive with a lot of great suggestions, and I've
had a really good time doing this.  Thanks to everyone for the support,
suggestions, and translations!&#13;</P
><P
>I've had several requests both from individuals and the LDP group to issue
a new version of this document, and it's long past due (two and a half years 
since the last version) - for which I apologize.  Converting this monster
to DocBook format was a daunting task, and then when I realized that I
could now include images, I decided I needed to include all the cool
examples that currently reside on my homepage.  Adding these is a slow
process, especially since I'm improving the code as I go, so only a few are
included so far.  This document will probably always feel incomplete to me
...  I think however that it's reasonably sound from a technical point of
view (although I have some mailed in fixes that aren't in here yet
- if you've heard from me, they'll get in here eventually) so I'm going to
post it and hope I can get to another version soon.&#13;</P
><P
>One other revision of note: this document (as requested by the LDP) is now
under the GFDL.  Enjoy.&#13;</P

>You will need Bash.  This should be easy: it's the default shell for just
about every Linux distribution I know of.  The commonest version is now
2.0.x.  Version 1.14.7 was the standard for a long time, but that started
to fade around 2000.  I've been using Bash 2.0.x for quite a while now.  With
recent revisions of the HOWTO (later than July 2001) I've been using a lot
of code (mainly ${} substitutions) that I believe is specific to 2.x and
may not work with Bash 1.x.  You can check your Bash version by typing
<KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>echo $BASH_VERSION</KBD
> at the prompt.  On my machine, it
responds with <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>2.05a.0(1)-release</SAMP
>.&#13;</P
><P
>Shell programming experience would be good, but isn't essential: the more
you know, the more complex the prompts you'll be able to create.  I assume
a basic knowledge of shell programming and Unix utilities as I go through
this tutorial.  However, my own shell programming skills are limited, so I
give a lot of examples and explanation that may appear unnecessary to an
experienced shell programmer.&#13;</P

>There are issues with the PDF and RTF conversions (as of December 2000),
including big problems with example code wrapping around the screen and
getting mangled.  I always keep my examples less than 80 characters wide,
but the PDF version seems to wrap around 60.  Please use online examples if
the code in these versions don't work for you.  But they do look very
pretty.&#13;</P

compile time options.  If you're using a binary distribution such as comes
with a standard Linux distribution, all such features should be compiled

in mind if something you expected to work doesn't.  Some notes about this

replaced by a "$" for a normal user, and a "#" if you are root, and the

modifications made by the prompt.  However, I've had problems seeing the
"#" when I'm root.  I believe this is because Bash doesn't like two dollar
signs in a row.  Use <KBD

>Most Linux systems have a default prompt in one colour (usually gray) that
tells you your user name, the name of the machine you're working on, and
some indication of your current working directory.  This is all useful
information, but you can do much more with the prompt: all sorts of
information can be displayed (tty number, time, date, load, number of
users, uptime ...) and the prompt can use ANSI colours, either to make it
look interesting, or to make certain information stand out.  You can also
manipulate the title bar of an Xterm to reflect some of this information.&#13;</P

>Beyond looking cool, it's often useful to keep track of system information.
One idea that I know appeals to some people is that it makes it possible to
put prompts on different machines in different colours.  If you have
several Xterms open on several different machines, or if you tend to forget
what machine you're working on and delete the wrong files (or shut down the
server instead of the workstation), you'll find this a great way to
remember what machine you're on.&#13;</P

>The appearance of the prompt is governed by the shell variable PS1.
Command continuations are indicated by the PS2 string, which can be
modified in exactly the same ways discussed here - since controlling it is
exactly the same, and it isn't as "interesting," I'll mostly be modifying
the PS1 string.  (There are also PS3 and PS4 strings.  These are never seen
by the average user - see the Bash man page if you're interested in their
purpose.)  To change the way the prompt looks, you change the PS1 variable.
For experimentation purposes, you can enter the PS1 strings directly at the
prompt, and see the results immediately (this only affects your current
session, and the changes go away when you exit the current shell).  If you
want to make a change to the prompt permanent, look at the section below
<A
HREF="#SETPS"
>Section 2.6</A
>.&#13;</P
><P
>Before we get started, it's important to remember that the PS1 string is
stored in the environment like any other environment variable.  If you
modify it at the command line, your prompt will change.  Before you make
any changes, you can save your current prompt to another environment
variable:</P

approximate equivalent of sourcing a bash/bourne shell script save that no
file I/O need be done as the function is already in memory.  The shell
functions are typically loaded from [.bashrc or .bash_profile] depending on
whether you want them only in the initial shell or in subshells as well.
Contrast this with running a shell script: Your shell forks, the child does
an exec, potentially the path is searched, the kernel opens the file and
examines enough bytes to determine how to run the file, in the case of a
shell script a shell must be started with the name of the script as its
argument, the shell then opens the file, reads it and executes the
statements.  Compared to a shell function, everything other than executing
the statements can be considered unnecessary overhead."</SPAN

>Any arguments you pass to the alias are passed to the command line of the
aliased command (ls in the first two cases).  Note that aliases can be
nested, and they can be used to make a normal unix command behave in a
different way.  (I agree with the argument that you shouldn't use the
latter kind of aliases - if you get in the habit of relying on "rm *" to
ask you if you're sure, you may lose important files on a system that
doesn't use your alias.)&#13;</P
><P
>Functions are used for more complex program structures.  As a general rule,
use an alias for anything that can be done in one line.  Functions differ
from shell scripts in that they are loaded into the environment so that
they work more quickly.  As a general rule again, you would want to
keep functions relatively small, and any shell script that gets relatively
large should remain a shell script rather than turning it into a function.
Your decision to load something as a function is also going to depend on
how often you use it.  If you use a small shell script infrequently, leave
it as a shell script.  If you use it often, turn it into a function.&#13;</P

>This could readily be set as an alias, but for the sake of example, we'll
make it a function.  If you type the text shown into a text file and then
source that file, the function will be in your environment, and be
immediately available at the command line without the overhead of a shell
script mentioned previously.  The usefulness of this becomes more obvious
if you consider adding more functionality to the above function, such as
using an if statement to execute some special code when links are found in
the listing.&#13;</P

command substitution.  Without it, the external command is executed exactly
once: when the PS1 string is read into the environment.  For this prompt,
that would mean that it would display the same time no matter how long the
prompt was used.  The backslash protects the contents of $() from immediate
shell interpretation, so <B

that allow you to manipulate data.  If you find yourself trying to create
complex combinations of these programs within a prompt, it may be easier to
make an alias, function, or shell script of your own, and call it from the
prompt.  Escape sequences are often required in bash shell scripts to
ensure that shell variables are expanded at the correct time (as seen above
with the date command): this is raised to another level within the prompt
PS1 line, and avoiding it by creating functions is a good idea.&#13;</P

track of that in his head (or types "pwd").  He learned Unix with csh and
tcsh, so he uses his command history extensively (something many of us
weaned on Bash do not do), so the first item in the prompt is the history
number.  The second item is the tty number, an item that can be useful to
"screen" users.  The third item is the exit value of the last
command/pipeline (note that this is rendered useless by any command
executed within the prompt - you can work around that by capturing it to
a variable and playing it back, though).  Finally, the "\$" is a dollar
sign for a regular user, and switches to a hash mark ("#") if the user is
root.&#13;</P

><P
>Outside of the characters that you can type on your keyboard, there are a
lot of other characters you can print on your screen.  I've created a
script to allow you to check out what the font you're using has available
for you.  The main command you need to use to utilize these characters is
"echo -e".  The "-e" switch tells echo to enable interpretation of
backslash-escaped characters.  What you see when you look at octal 200-400
will be very different with a VGA font from what you will see with a
standard Linux font.  Be warned that some of these escape sequences have
odd effects on your terminal, and I haven't tried to prevent them from
doing whatever they do.  The linedraw and block characters that are used 
heavily by the Bashprompt project are between octal 260 and 337 in the VGA
fonts.</P

#   "hostloadcolour" - 17 October 98, by Giles
#
#   The idea here is to change the colour of the host name in the prompt, 
#   depending on a threshold load value.

# THRESHOLD_LOAD is the value of the one minute load (multiplied
# by one hundred) at which you want
# the prompt to change from COLOUR_LOW to COLOUR_HIGH
THRESHOLD_LOAD=200
COLOUR_LOW='1;34'
          # light blue
COLOUR_HIGH='1;31'
           # light red

function prompt_command {
ONE=$(uptime | sed -e "s/.*load average: \(.*\...\), \(.*\...\), \(.*\...\)/\1/" -e "s/ //g")
#   Apparently, "scale" in bc doesn't apply to multiplication, but does
#   apply to division.
ONEHUNDRED=$(echo -e "scale=0 \n $ONE/0.01 \nquit \n" | bc)
if [ $ONEHUNDRED -gt $THRESHOLD_LOAD ] 
then 
    HOST_COLOUR=$COLOUR_HIGH
	# Light Red
else
    HOST_COLOUR=$COLOUR_LOW
	# Light Blue
fi
}

function hostloadcolour {

PROMPT_COMMAND=prompt_command

}</PRE

>Using your favorite editor, save this to a file named "hostloadcolour".  If
you have the Bashprompt package installed, this will work as a theme.  If you
don't, type <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>source hostloadcolour</KBD
> and then <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>hostloadcolour</KBD

Either way, "prompt_command" becomes a function in your environment.
If you examine the code, you will notice that the colours ($COLOUR_HIGH and 
$COLOUR_LOW) are set using only a partial colour code, ie. "1;34" instead of
"\[\033[1;34m\]", which I would have preferred.  I have been unable to get
it to work with the complete code.  Please let me know if you manage this.</P

works.  It's pretty slow on a P75, though, so I removed it."</SPAN

#    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA
#    02111-1307, USA.
#
# Purpose:
#
#    This program is intended to be called each time a shell prompt is
#    displayed. It looks at current CPU times (user+system) for the shell and
#    its children, and if the CPU time is more than some user-specified amount
#    then user-specified commands are executed.  The author uses it to provide
#    an audio indication of when a long-running command completes.
#
# Usage:
#
#    The prompt_bell command takes two arguments: the name of a file
#    containing the latest CPU usage information for the shell and its
#    children, and some optional state information from the environment
#    variable $PROMPT_BELL_STATE.
#
#    The times file simply contains one or more times, zero or more to a line,
#    each of the form `#h#m#.#s' where `#' is a sequence of one or more
#    decimal digits and `#h' is the optional number of hours, `#m' is the
#    required number of minutes, and `#.#s' is the number of seconds and
#    fractions thereof. The total time is the sum of all the times in this
#    file. Example:
#
#        0m0.050s 0m0.060s
#        0m15.790s 0m0.220s
#
#    The output from this command is one or more semicolon-separated shell
#    commands which should be eval'd by the caller. If the difference between
#    the current CPU times and the previous CPU times (stored in environment
#    variable PROMPT_BELL_STATE) is more than $PROMPT_BELL_TIME seconds
#    (default 10) then the commands printed include the value of environment
#    variable PROMPT_BELL_CMD (default is "echo -ne '\a'").
#
#    Typical usage is:
#        eval "`prompt_bell $TIMES_FILE $PROMPT_BELL_STATE`"
#
#    and this command is usually part of the bash PROMPT_COMMAND. The author's
#    .bashrc contains the following:
#
#        PROMPT_BELL_TIME=15
#        PROMPT_BELL_CMD="echo -e 'done.\a'"
#
#        COMMAND_PROMPT='TIMES_FILE=/tmp/times.$$;
#                        times &#62;$TIMES_FILE;
#                        eval "`prompt_bell $TIMES_FILE $PROMPT_BELL_STATE`";
#                        /bin/rm -f $TIMES_FILE'
#        export PROMPT_BELL_TIME PROMPT_BELL_CMD COMMAND_PROMPT
#
#    Note: the output of `times' is stored in a temporary file to prevent it
#    from being executed in a subshell whose CPU times are always nearly zero.

Because many X terminal emulators don't implement cursor position save and
restore, the alternative when putting a clock in the upper right corner is
to anchor the cursor at the bottom of the terminal.  This builds on the
idea of the "termwide" prompt above, drawing a line up the right side of
the screen from the prompt to the clock.  A VGA font is required.</P
