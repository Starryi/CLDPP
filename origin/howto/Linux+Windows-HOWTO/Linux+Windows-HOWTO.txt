1.3. Intended Audience

 Nancy just bought a new computer. It came preloaded with Windows 98. Nancy
wants to run accounting software supported by Windows 98 and mathematical
research software. Nancy is an accountant and donates her time as the
accountant for the local chapter of a charitable organization. The charitable
organization requires the chapters to use standard software that they have
chosen. This software is only supported on Windows 98, so Nancy must have
Windows 98 to donate her accounting services. Nancy also teaches mathematics
and personally pursues research mathematics. She is not a programmer amd
doesn't want to waste unnecessary time doing system administration nor working
with inflexible software. She believes that octave, c++ and the best research
software is supported by unix. As a unix dialect she wants linux.
 Lisa is shopping for a new computer to replace her aging host. Her computer
will be preloaded with RedHat 6.2 linux. Lisa is a professional programmer, who
plans to run a server and firewall on her old computer. Lisa wants a low
maintenance machine that reliability does her bidding. Occasionally she needs
to read and write files for Macintosh and/or Windows users. She plans to remove
Windows 95 from her old computer and run a dedicated server and firewall under
linux. In accordance with her Microsoft End User License Agreement she will
transfer Windows 95 to her new computer. Since she plans to spend most of her
time in linux, it isn't worth buying a second Windows license to run Windows on
both hosts.
 Oscar is a system administrator for a large corporation that uses Windows NT
and Irix workstations. One of the Windows NT workstations has just crashed and
won't boot. Oscar has to recover critical data from the host which was not
backed up. He needs tools to script searches and filter files. Oscar wants to
use the panolpy of unix commands to low-level examine the hard disk in his
search for the lost corporate assets. Last year Oscar configured a "dual
booter" but he no longer remembers the details.
 Tom is a graduate school teacher. Tom also teaches continuing education at the
local community house. Nancy is a friend of Tom and asked for his help with her
new computer. Tom is happy to oblige and this HOWTO is one of the consequences.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4. How to Use This HOWTO

 This HOWTO is focused on a general step-by-step procedure. You should first
read which character among the intended audience that you most nearly match.
Follow along as Tom helps each characters configure their systems. Before doing
more than skimming, you should at least skim the critical concepts. Some of the
words used may be unfamiliar, obsolete, or applied differently, so it is
important to understand their usage in this HOWTO. Please write the maintainer
with your experience good or bad.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5. Concepts

Understanding this HOWTO depends on understanding its use of the following
concepts.

* Disk and Format
* Partition and Filesystem
* Operating System

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Procedure


2.1. Reference


  1.   Backup your software and data
  2.    Compile a catalog of hardware component models and software versions.
  3.  Attach new disks.
  4.   Compact the existing software and data.
  5.    Repartition the disk.
  6.    Format the new partitions.
  7.    Load the new operating systems.
  8.    Install the boot manager (uc).
  9.     Cross mount the devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1. Backup

 Installing linux on Nancy system will involve repartitioning. Any time you
repartition a hard disk you run a significant risk of losing data on the disk.
More precisely repartitioning does not actually cause data loss, but does tend
to discover data that was lost piror.
 Tom warned Nancy that she should backup everything before starting. Familiar
with pluming repair, Tom knew that whey you shut off the water for 10min to
replace a dripping faucet, you often find that the pipes in the floor were
rusted and leaking. Nancy knew nothiing of plumbing, but she had a good book
collection and had moved several times. She knew that bookshelves often break
when you move them.
Since Lisa is buying a new computer, she has nothing yet to backup. When Oscar
asked for the backups of the crashed computer he was met with the usual blank
expressions. His job is essentially ot make a backup of the otherwise lost
data.
This version of this HOWTO does not detail how to backup. If you wish to see
more information on backing up or if you wish to provide information please
contact the maintainer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.2. Catalog

During installation, the size of disks, and other accurate specifications will
be necessary. Entry of slightly wrong values will result in subtle problems
that may not show up immediately but will often be chronic, frustratingly
difficult to diagnose, and maybe impossible to fix.
Windows and your linux distribution may not support the same hardware. You
should see the Hardware Compatibility HOWTO for a list of what is known to be
compatible or incompatible.
In general Windows is the more restrictive with exception of WinModems/
WinPrinters/.... Any hardware supported by Windows will usually be supported by
linux, though not necessarily included in your distribution. Much hardware,
especially the old and the cutting edge, may be supported by linux but not by
Windows. If not included in your distribution, you can usually download linux
drivers and or modules from the Internet.
Winmodems, Winprinters, Winscanners, etc. are not supportable under linux.
These devices are actually firmware that depend on proprietary Windows
software. In the United States it is illegal to sell a linux distribution that
supports these devices.
 Lisa has dealt with software long enough to know the value of specifications.
Even before purchasing a computer, Lisa has already created a log. For each
computer being considered from each prospective vendor, Lisa has a list of each
component, its model and capabilities.
 Tom knows that one of the least expensive means to support reliability in any
complex system (computer, airplane, car, etc.) is by keeping accurate
maintenance records. Many (if not most) of the compatiblity problems reported
by Tom's students would be prevented if accurate records were kept and
consulted.
Tom usually recommends avoiding WinModems, etc. because their performance
limitations are too severe for most people..
 Oscar's company keeps records on the hardware components of each computer.
Before trying to fix any problem, Oscar examines the log and often finds that
intractible problems becomre easily solved when you know the model details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3. Attach

One of the useful features of linux is the wide range of diagnostic and repair
tools that it supports. The easy ability to write scripts also makes it easy to
write worms and do other recovery operations.
 Oscar has easy access to a spare hard drive. He checked the Hardware
Compatibility HOWTO to select a hard drive model.

* Oscar grounds himself with a wrist strap to avoid accidental electrostatic
  damage.
* He opens the case according to the service manual.
* He slides the disk into the secondary drive slot and attaches an IDE cable.
* Oscar closes the case and ungrounds himself.

This version of this HOWTO does not detail how to attach new drives. If you
wish to see more information on attaching or if you wish to provide information
please contact the maintainer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.4. Compact

Most new computers preloaded with Windows are delivered with a single FAT32
partition that occupies the entire disk. Before loading a second operating
system on a shared disk, it must be split into at least two partitions, since
Windows and some linux distributions will not tolerate another operating system
on the same partition.
 Software is normally stored distributed across the disk partition. Before
splitting a partition, all the data must be moved to the start of the
partition, so that when the partition is split, the old software and data won't
be lost. Tom warns Lisa, Nancy, and especially Oscar that compacting is not
reversible. If the partition is error-free, no active files will be lost, but
disconnected (deleted) files may be lost. If the partition has errors, tools
exist that can often (but not always) recover disconnected files before
compaction. After compacting , the disconnected files are probably
unrecoverable.
The fips included in tomsrtbt-1.6.335 is 0.9e and Tom has used it directly with
Windows 95. Windows98 requires fips-2.0 or later which (at press time) was not
included in the archived tomsrtbt distributions.
Nancy is unafamiliar with open source code and the Internet, so Tom offers to
create her fips disk.

  1. Download fips-2.0 and expand in the directory $FIPSROOT
     (This may require privelege depending on Tom's linux configuration)
     (The address will probably change by the time you read this.)
      _______________________________________________________________________
     |                                                                       |
     |  bash> FIPSROOT=/opt/packages/fips-2.0                                |
     |  bash> mkdir -p $FIPSROOT/original                                    |
     |  bash> cd $FIPSROOT/original                                          |
     |  bash> wget ftp://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/pub/Linux/sunsite.unc.edu/system/|
     |  installl/fips-2.0.zip                                                |
     |  bash> cd $PIPSROOT                                                   |
     |  bash> unzip -d oritinal/fips-2.0.zip                                 |
     |  			                                                                  |
     |_______________________________________________________________________|

  2. Insert and mount the startup disk from Nancy.
     (This may require priveleges depending on Tom's linux configuration)
      ______________________________________
     |                                      |
     |  bash> mkdir -p /floppy              |
     |  bash> mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /floppy|
     |  			                                 |
     |______________________________________|

  3. Follow the instructions for fips. At press time, this means copy 3 files
     to the startup disk.
      ___________________________________________________
     |                                                   |
     |  bash> cp restorrb.exe fips.exe errors.txt /floppy|
     |  			                                              |
     |___________________________________________________|

  4. Unmoun the floppy and return it to Nancy.
      ______________________
     |                      |
     |  bash> umount /floppy|
     |  			                 |
     |______________________|


 Nancy's new machine was delivered preloaded with Windows 98 on a single
partition occupying the entire disk. The installation was already compact, but
Nancy used scandisk and defrag anyway just to be safe. When splitting the
partition with fips, it warns that the physical partition length does not equal
the logical partitin length. Tom explains that this is expected since her disk
has more than 1024 cylinders. Tom suggests that Nancy record the current
partition info in case it is needed to recover from a disaster. Following Tom's
suggestion, Nancy reduces the first partition to approximately 30% of the total
disk size.

  1. Create a statup disk and give it to Tom.
     [Start][Settings...\Control Panel] [[Add/Remove Programs] [Startup Disk]
     [Create Disk ...]
  2. Verify that the disk has no detectible errors.
     (There may still be hiddent errors.)
     [My Computer] {(C:\)} [Properties ...] [Tools] [Error-checking
     status\Check now ...] [Type of test\Thorough] [Start]
  3. Fis any errors reported.
  4. Defragment the disk to remove blank areas and deleted files.
     [My computer] {(C:\)} [Properties ...] [Tools] [Defragmentation
     status\Defragment now ...]
  5. Insert the fips startup disk from Tom and restart the computer.
     [Start] [Shutdown...] [Restart] [OK]
  6. When the computer reboots, split the partition.

2.1.5. Repartition

A normal linux installation requires at least two partitions. It usually
improves performance to more partitions. Most bioses support no more than 4
primary partitions.
 Tom recommends that the disk be divided into 4 partitions.

  1. ~33% Windows bootable
     Windows requires residency on the first primary partition
  2. ~33% linux bootable
     On most computers, bootable partitions must reside entirely below 1024
     cylinders.
  3. ~64M swap
     A filesystem optimized for memory caching improves performance.
  4. ~33% data
     The last partition may be used by either or both operating systems if is
     compartible.

The Windows bootable partition must be one of the filesystems supported by
Windows. Likewise the linux bootable partition must be one of the filesystems
supported by linux. The swap partition must have a filesystem supported by the
operating system that will use it. The last partition will be used for data,
and can have any filesystm.
At press time, the above division is safe for most computers.
Nancy is unfamiliar with open source and the Internet, so Tom lends her one of
his diagnostic disks with tomsrtbt..
tomsrtbt is a small distribution of linux on a single floppy disk that loads
into RAM. Since it does not occupy nor run on the hard disk it is superb for
situations where the hard disk will be modified (e.g. repartitioning).
Tom stresses that repartitioning is simple but must be done with meticulous
care, since everything else depends on it. Like ignoring a crack in the
foundation of a house, partition table errors may not become apparent for a
long time, when it will be difficult or impossible to correct.
 Nancy will be using her system primarily with Windows, so Tom recommends that
her data partition use FAT32 From the compoent catalog that Tom prepared for
her computer, Nancy knows that her hard disk has 1661 cylinders.

  1. 0001-0501 Windows FAT32 bootable
  2. 0502-1002 linux ext2 bootable
  3. 1003-1011 linux swap
  4. 1012-1661 data FAT32

 Lisa will be using her system primarily with linux, so her data partition will
use ext2 The data partition will then be unavailable to Windows, but will be
more easily used from linux. Lisa's hard disk has 787 cylinders.

  1. 0001-0262 Windows FAT32 bootable
  2. 0263-0525 linux ext2 bootable
  3. 0526-0779 linux swap
  4. 0780-0787 data ext2

 Nancy uses the tomsrtbt disk provided by Tom and fdisk on it to edit her
partition table.

  1. Insert the tomsrtbt disk and restart the computer.
  2. Read the fdisk instructions and list of known partition types

2.1.6. Format

In order to use any hard disk effectively, it must be formatted. After
formating, whther successful or not, all the old data in that partition is lost
(the cost of recovery goes up 10-100x).
 Tom warns that Formatting is the only operation that is neither idempotent nor
reversible. The tool provided by the intended operating system should be used
to format the partitions intended for that partition. Use format under Windows
to format FAT32 partitions. Use
 Nancy formats the data partition under Windows.

  1. Restart the computer in Windows
  2. Format the partition
     [[My Computer]] {(D:)} [Format ...] [Format type\Full] [Start] Nancy uses
     the tomsrtbt disk provided by Tom to format the linux and swap partitions
     under linux.
  3. Insert the tomsrtbt disk and restart

2.1.7. Initial Program Load

Now is when the operating system(s) becomes a part ot the computer. All prior
steps laid the foundation. This is the first time when the detail and accuracy
of the catalog will be especially useful. Follow the installation instructions
provided with your distribution. This HOWTO does not detail how to load the
distribution because the distribution instructions will provide the best
instructions.
 Though linux is available at no cost, Tom recommends purchasing a distribution
with hardcopy instructions and support tools.. The price of a good distribution
is well worth it. In Tom's opinion, asking friends is the best way to choose a
linux distribution. A distribution that satisfies your friends with similar
interests will probably satisfy you.
Tom knows that Nancy got a newly released graphics card with which he has no
experience. He warns Nancy that the X configuration may not work. When she
calls him, he uses the expert options of yast which tell him that though her
card is not listed by manufacturer and model it used the mach64 X server. Now
familiar with yast, Nancy installs the mach64 x server and removes the svga X
server. Tom stays to talk Nancy through X installation. Nancy's monitor is not
named in the configuration list, but with the model known from the catalog, a
quick visit to the manufacturer's website provides the scan rate limits.
Tom knows that the configurability of linux frightens many new users and so he
has often recommended RedHat to first-time users because of its commercial
technical support and default configuration settings. He lets Nancy know that
though she should try to consider each question before answering, she need fear
a mistake because she can reverse almost any configuration decision later. Most
packages managment tools offer to load and save configurations files (e.g. /
etc/linuxrc).

* Keep a list of the configuration questions and each answer to them.
* When in doubt, add a package to linux, and note that it was in doubt.
* A month after installation, go back and remove any packages that you haven't
  used, and log the removal.
* Expect to discover some linux configuration errors by loss.
* Change the linux configuration when you find that it is different from your
  desires.
* When in doubt, do not add a package to Windows.

Tom knows that some differences between Windows and linux force some
compromises.

* Set the hardware clock to local time.
  Windows displays time, timestamps file operations, and synchronizes with the
  netowrk from the same clock.
  Linux uses separate clocks for each of these. On a linux only system, the
  hardware clock is usually set to UTC (Universal Time Coordinate), the network
  standard. The network and file operations clock are usually just views of the
  hardware clock by linux. For display, linux usually shifts the hardware clock
  according to the timezone and date.
  Since Windows supports only one clock, you must decide (unless you live in
  Greenwich England) whether to set the hardware clock to local time or UTC.
  If you use UTC, you will have to mentally convert the time displayed by
  Windows to local time.
  If you use local time, some network activity may become confused.
  International email problems are most commonly reported. Mail sent from
  Berlin at 1300 local time may be stored a second later in New York at 1200
  UTC where it awaits a channel to its San Francisco destination. To save
  space, the New York host may delete mail that could not be sent in a
  reasonable time of 30min. If the Berlin mail was unclear that it was sent at
  1300 Berlin time, or if the New York host is unwilling to do the conversion,
  the email may be lost as undliverable after 1 hour (1300 - 1200).

 Since Nancy is an accountant, Tom recommends that she use the SuSE
distribution. SuSE comes with the ApplixWare suite of office software. Nancy
has already read the installation chapters of the book that accompanied her
SuSE distribution. yast from SuSE lets her store her configuration choices in a
file which she includes in her computer log.

  1. Nancy makes sure she has the catalog (and Tom's phone number) handy.
  2. She inserts the SuSE CDROM and reboots the computer.
  3. She selects installation options (English, Color, ...)
  4. She examines the hardware detected for her system and confirms that it
     matches her own catalog.
     Both the hard disk and CD-RW were detected.
     Both the sound and graphics cards were detected.
     Both the PCI and USB buses were detected.
  5. Following the instructions from SuSE, she starts YaST, the system
     configuration tool.
  6. Already partitions, Nancy declines YaST's offer to repartition her disk.
  7. Already formatted by Windows, Nancy declines YaST's offer to format her
     Window's partitions.
  8. Though already formatted, Nancy accepts the offer to reformat her swap and
     linux partitions.
  9. Set the mount points for the partitions.

     |____________________________________________|

 10. Nancy now selects the packages she wants.
     Nancy includes the nonstandard packages that she knows she wants (e.g. CD
     writing).
     Nancy excludes the standard packages that she knows she doesn't want (e.g.
     tape drive support).
     Nancy selects packagas for her specific hardware (e.g. X server) using her
     catalog.
     She indicates that the hardware clock is set to local time.
     Nancy saves a copy of her configuration and puts in her log.

 (This subsection of this HOWTO is not yet written.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.8. Boot Manager Load

If you have two or more operating systems on a computer, you must have a means
of selecting which operating system is loaded.
 Before installing a boot manager, Tom recommends that Nancy and Lisa make a
boot disk (and master boot record backup). He also recommends that each test
their boot disks before installing the boot manager. This is done so that the
computer can be booted and the master boot record restored to the hard disk if
the boot manager installation fails
Because of its configurability and robustness, Tom recommends lilo to most
users.. Most linux distributions support multiple linux versions on the same
partition. This means that you can install and test an upgrade to the operating
system without the trouble of a lengthy reinstallation. When the upgrade is
satisfactory (or not) you can remove versions no longer useful.
 During installation, SuSE offers to make a boot disk, and master boot record
backup, before installing lilo.

  1. Create a rescue floppy.
      ___________________________
     |                           |
     |  [CREATE A BOOT DISK?/YES]|
     |  		                       |
     |___________________________|

  2. Nancy write-protects the disk and puts in her log.
  3. Nancy installs lilo
      _________________________________
     |                                 |
     |  [LILO INSTALLATION ...]        |
     |  Windows /dev/hda1              |
     |  SuSE    /dev/hda2 /boot/vmlinuz|
     |  		                             |
     |_________________________________|


 Windows installation overwrites the master boot record with one that loads
Windows. After installing Windows, Lisa must reinstall lilo. To make this
easier she uses loalin under Windows to load her existing linux and then uses
linus to configure and install lilo..

3.3. Linux Distribution

Your choice of distribution will depend mostly on friends' recommendations,
your level of computer expertise, and easy availability of packages. Most
distributions will happily reside on the same disk, so there is no reason not
to try several distributions until you find the one that is best for you.

4. Actual Experiences - Adding linux to New Computer Preloaded with Windows 98

 Nancy is unfamiliar with keeping a log, so Tom prepared it for her as he
unboxed and assembled her new computer. tom also knows that it is far easier to
remove the computer case once and record all the model numbers, chipsets, and
model types than it is to later open the case to get a single model number or
to guess the information that will be later needed. During the computer service
life, only 10% of the numbers collected will ever be used, but there is no easy
way to predict which 10%.
 The following is an extract from Nancy's log. Identidation numbers have been
changed and some irrelevant data has been removed. Most of the data came from
the invoice that accomapanied the computer and the specifications
[Start\Run...\] Open: c:\DELL\DOCS\EDOCS.EXE [OK] that were provided on the
computer.

4.1. Configuration

A hardcopy of critical portions of this information, master disks, and backup
disks is kept in a white binder, located physically close to this host,
labelled Nancy System Administration Log.

  A.1.7. How_large_should_my_swap_partition_be?

  A.1.8. Should_I_add_package_xxx?

A.1.1.After running fips, why does Windows report that I still have only one
partition?
Windows 98 does not recognize the effect of fips-0.9e. fips-2.0 has
successfully been used to split a Windows98 partition. According to an
unreliable source, Windows 98 reads partition data from the first 512 bytes of
the partition itself and considers this more reliable data than the partition
table.
A.1.2.Why does my tool report an error that physical length does not match the
logical length of the partition?
This means that the partition table is inconsistent, and may be inaccurate.
Modifying a disk with an inaccurate partition table usually requires an expert
to reduce the almost certain chance of data loss.
The severity of this message is dependent on the size of the disk. Due to
historical limitations, most (but not all) computer BIOSs only support disks
with less than 1024 cylinders. Booting the operating system depends on the
bios, therefore (on such systems), the entire operating system must fit within
this 1024 cylinders.. For the same historical reasons, the partition table
format only supports reporting disk sizes of 1024 or less cylinders. Many disks
today have more than 1024 physical cylinders but by convention the partition
table records exactly 1024 cylinders. The operating system still needs to know
where the actual partitions begin an end beyond the first 1024 cylinders and
this is recorded in the partition table.
A large disk with more than 1024 cylinders will have a logical size (sum of
partition sizes) that exceeds 1024 and matches the actual size, though the
partition table reports a physical size of exactly 1024 cylinders. In the case
of a large disk, this message is essentially useless.
A.1.3.How do I know what version of Windows I have?
One or more of the following should tell you what version of Windows you have.

* C:\>ver
* {My Compuer} [Properties] [General]
* [Start] [Run...] Open: command [OK]
* [Start\Run...] Open: ver [OK]
* [Start\Run...] Open: cmd ver [OK]

A.1.4.How do I know what version of linux kernel I have?
bash> uname -a
A.1.5.How do I know what version of linux distribution I have?
The question may have no meaningful answer. Since unix dialects (e.g. linux)
use many interchangeable parts, it makes little difference to this HOWTO what
distribution you have. The applications loaded on most linux hosts varies with
time and the tastes of the owner, so that they seldom match any distribution
for more than a very brief period.
Most distributions are loosely classed by the package manager that they use.

* pkgtool - slackware
* rpm - RedHat

bash> uname -a
A.1.6.If I make a mistake can I start over?
In general, no. For this reason, meticuluous care is required, especially at
certain stages. Some of the operations are idempotent. An idempotent operation
is one which either fails and has no effect, or succeeds and has no effect
after its first success. Some of the operations are reversible. A reversible
operation has an inverse operation so that you can return things to what they
were and start over.
Formatting is especially dangerous because it is neither idempotent nor
reversible. If formatting succeeds, the original data is lost. If formatting
fails, the original data is probably lost (since indices are usually destroyed
early).

A.1.7.How large should my swap partition be?
Swap partition size (or even its existence) is a hotly debated issue beyond the
scope of this HOWTO. Many books on performanc tuning provide guidelines on swap
partition size and how to recognize a need to expand or shrink it. At press
time, the author recommends 64M as a safe size.
A.1.8.Should I add package xxx?
A reader of this HOWTO presumably wants to benefit from the strengths of both
Windows and linux, and suffer the shortcomings of neither.
Most linux distributions allow you to cleanly remove any package. unix dialects
support permissions so that each package gets a well defined share of the
computer and this share can be identified and taken back in its entirety. unix
dialects support symbolic links so that the package can appear to be in a
convenient place without actually occupying space from the convenient place.
The distributions that do not support easy removal are usually tiny specialized
distributions like tomsrtbt. The risk that an unwanted package will plague your
linux indefinitely is small since you can remove it at any time.
Most Windows packages can never be uninstalled cleanly under Windows, as they
usually leave dll updates and registry entries. It is therefore important to
add packages only when you are sure that you need them, since your only way of
removing them may be to reinstall Windows and every package that you want.
Sharing a machine between Windows and linux, means that linux can aid clean
removal of packages from Windows. Since it only identifies but does not
predict, linux cannot insure clean removal. Since linux find resolves to the
second rather than Windows find to the day, it can much more accurately
identify what was changed.

  1. Record the date and time before you install a package to Windows.
  2. Install the package.
  3. Record the date and time after you install the package.
  4. Under linux, use touch to create a file timestamped at the start of
     installation.
  5. Under linux, use touch to create a file timestamped at the end of
     installation.
  6. Under linux, use find to identify every Windows file and folder that was
     altered during installation.
  7. Store the list of altered files and folders to identify what has to be
     removed or restored.

Glossary



B


      A bios (Basic Input/Output System) is a small operating system supplied
      with and usually encoded in the computer hardware. The bios is often
      little more than is needed to load and run the operating system normally
      used. Most BIOSs at press time reside in shadow ram which is
      electronically removed from the computer once the normal operating system
      is loaded and starts running.

  Disk
      A disk is a physical storage medium. A disk must be formatted before data
      on the disk is accessible. A municipal library building is a good model
      of a disk. The building itslf has a fixed volume and can therefore hold a
      fixed number of books. The largest number of books can be stored by
      simply dumping them inside the building, but the result would simply be a
      big trash pile and the books would not be available for use. In order to
      use the books, they are placed on bookshelves so they can be accessed.
      Placing the equivalent of bookshelves on the disk is called formatting

  Formating
      Though beyond the scope of this HOWTO, low-level formatting refers to the
      phsyical division of the magnetic media into magnetic domains similar to
      applying the bias to magnetic tape.
      See Also:Disk.



M


      Each bootable partition has firmware that runs in the bios. This firmware
      historically occupies the 446 bytes before the partition table. A simple
      master boot record simply copies the operating system from the media into
      memory and turns computer control over to the operating system.
      At power up, cold boot, or warm boot, the bios searches the computer
      storage media until it finds a master boot record which it then executes
      it. The search locations and order differ between different bioses. Often
      the search order is configuratble with firmware encoded in the computer
      hardware with the bios. The most common search order is floppy, cdrom,
      network, usb disk, scsi disk, ide disk.
      A more complex master boot record, called a boot manager, loads a program
      into memory that gives the user an opportunity to select which operating
      system to load.



O


      An operating system is firmware that supports effective computter use. As
      an allocator, the operating system verifies that only one process at a
      time controls the cpu , disk, write access to a file, and other
      unshareable resources. As a toolkit, the operating system provides a set
      of software pieces for common functions (e.g. reading from a file,
      writing to the screen). As a virtual machine, the operating system makes
      the physical computer behave like another well-specified computer, so
      that software can be written once for the well-specified computer and
      then run on many physical computers with compatible operating systems. As
      an allocator, the operating system is like the staff that schedules the
      use of meeting rooms in the library. As a toolkit, the operating system
      is like the library staff that reshelves books or the library copier. As
      a virtual machine, the operating system is like one of the many libraries
      that endeaver to look like the U.S. Library of Congress with vertical
      bookshelves, a circular reference desk, and a lobby area with indices. A
      patron entering any such library finds the layout familiar, and one
      patron can give usable directions to a patron of a different library.

  Partition
      A disk is a physical portion of a disk. A filesystem is a map between
      addresses and files accessed on the disk. Most libraries are divided into
      floors or sections, such as Adult Fiction, Reference, and Juvenile Non-
      Fiction. Each section usually has its own card catalog and often
      different sections use different schemes. Adult Fiction is usually
      indexed by Author Name. Reference is usually indexed by Subject. There
      are even competing indexing schemes for the same section such as Dewey
      Decimal or Library of Congress.

  Partition Table
      Every disk has a partition table stored in a standard location and in a
      standard format on the disk. The partition table describes where each
      partition begins and ends on the disk. The partition table also describes
      what filesystem is used in each partition. The partition table is like
      the wall map that usually appears at the entry to any library. This wall
      map tells where each section (e.g. Reference, Adult Fiction, Juvenile
      Non-fiction) is located and how the books are shelved (e.g. Title,
      Author, Dewey Decimal)

  Repartitioning
      Before defragmenting, the index (I), active files (A) and deleted files
      (d) are distributed across the partition.

      After defragmenting, the index(I), and active files (A) are concentrated.
      Some deleted files (d) are lost. Some space formerly occupied by active
      files become lost (l).

      After splitting, no active data is lost, and a new partition appears that
      is not yet formatted.

      After formatting, each formatted partition has an empty filesystem. (e.g.
      dos6 (I, A), ext2 (N, A), vfat (V, A)).

  Winmodem
      Winmodems are a class of devices including winprinters, winscanners.
      Winmodems are a subset of the class of devices that achieve low-cost by
      replacing hardware in their convential equivalents with firmware run by
      the host. The drawback of these devices is that their dependence on the
      host usually slows or prohibits other operations simultaneously on the
      host.
      By analogy low-cost headlights for an automobile might consist of a
      flashlight atop a battery tray that sits in the front passenger seat. To
      use the headlights, you must start the car, remove the battery from the
      car, and install the car battery in the flashlight tray. The headlight
      cost is reduced by the cost of the solenoid, dashboard switch, wiring,
      and fuses. If you use the headlights, the limitations mean that you can't
      carry a front passenger, you can't restart the car, you can't use the car
      radio, and the fuel guage reads empty.
      Winmodems are distinct from the slightly larger class of these low-cost
      devices by the fact that they use proprietary firmware included in the
      Windows operating system. In the United States, it is illegal to sell
      firmware to use this proprietary firmware without Microsoft consent. At
      press time, the price of Microsoft consent is only slightly less than the
      cost of a convential device.
