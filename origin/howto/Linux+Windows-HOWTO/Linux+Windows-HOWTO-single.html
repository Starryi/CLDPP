	Nancy just bought a new computer.  It came preloaded with Windows 98. Nancy wants to run accounting software supported by Windows 98 and mathematical research software. Nancy is an accountant and donates her time as the accountant for the local chapter of a charitable organization.  The charitable organization requires the chapters to use standard software that they have chosen.  This software is only supported on Windows 98, so Nancy must have Windows 98 to donate her accounting services.  Nancy also teaches mathematics and personally pursues research mathematics.  She is not a programmer amd doesn't want to waste unnecessary time doing system administration nor working with inflexible software.  She believes that octave, c++ and the best research software is supported by unix.  As a unix dialect she wants linux.</P

	Lisa is shopping for a new computer to replace her aging host.  Her computer will be preloaded with RedHat 6.2 linux.  Lisa is a professional programmer, who plans to run a server and firewall on her old computer.  Lisa wants a low maintenance machine that reliability does her bidding.  Occasionally she needs to read and write files for Macintosh and/or Windows users.  She plans to remove Windows 95 from her old computer and run a dedicated server and firewall under linux.  In accordance with her Microsoft End User License Agreement she will transfer Windows 95 to her new computer.  Since she plans to spend most of her time in linux, it isn't worth buying a second Windows license to run Windows on both hosts.</P

	Oscar is a system administrator for a large corporation that uses Windows NT and Irix workstations.  One of the Windows NT workstations has just crashed and won't boot.  Oscar has to recover critical data from the host which was not backed up.  He needs tools to script searches and filter files.  Oscar wants to use the panolpy of unix commands to low-level examine the hard disk in his search for the lost corporate assets.  Last year Oscar configured a "dual booter" but he no longer remembers the details.</P

	Installing linux on Nancy system will involve repartitioning.  Any time you repartition a hard disk you run a significant risk of losing data on the disk.  More precisely repartitioning does not actually cause data loss, but does tend to discover data that was lost piror.</P

	Tom warned Nancy that she should backup everything before starting.  Familiar with pluming repair, Tom knew that whey you shut off the water for 10min to replace a dripping faucet, you often find that the pipes in the floor were rusted and leaking.  Nancy knew nothiing of plumbing, but she had a good book collection and had moved several times.  She knew that bookshelves often break when you move them.</P

	Software is normally stored distributed across the disk partition.  Before splitting a partition, all the data must be moved to the start of the partition, so that when the partition is split, the old software and data won't be lost.   Tom warns Lisa, Nancy, and especially Oscar that compacting is not reversible.  If the partition is error-free, no active files will be lost, but disconnected (deleted) files may be lost.  If the partition has errors, tools exist that can often (but not always) recover disconnected files before compaction.  After compacting , the disconnected files are probably unrecoverable.</P

Nancy's new machine was delivered preloaded with Windows 98 on a single partition occupying the entire disk.  The installation was already compact, but Nancy used scandisk and defrag anyway just to be safe.   When splitting the partition with fips, it warns that the physical partition length does not equal the logical partitin length.  Tom explains that this is expected since her disk has more than 1024 cylinders.  Tom suggests that Nancy record the current partition info in case it is needed to recover from a disaster.  Following Tom's suggestion, Nancy reduces the first partition to approximately 30% of the total disk size.</P

When she calls him, he uses the expert options of yast which tell him that though her card is not listed by manufacturer and model it used the mach64 X server.  Now familiar with yast, Nancy installs the mach64 x server and removes the svga X server.  Tom stays to talk Nancy through X installation.  Nancy's monitor is not named in the configuration list, but with the model known from the catalog, a quick visit to the manufacturer's website provides the scan rate limits.</P

He lets Nancy know that though she should try to consider each question before answering, she need fear a mistake because she can reverse almost any configuration decision later.   Most packages managment tools offer to load and save configurations files (e.g. /etc/linuxrc).</P

	Nancy is unfamiliar with keeping a log, so Tom prepared it for her as he unboxed and assembled her new computer.   tom also knows that it is far easier to remove the computer case once and record all the model numbers, chipsets, and model types than it is to later open the case to get a single model number or to guess the information that will be later needed.  During the computer service life, only 10% of the numbers collected will ever be used, but there is no easy way to predict which 10%.</P

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>Windows 98 does not recognize the effect of fips-0.9e.  fips-2.0 has successfully been used to split a Windows98 partition.  According to an unreliable source, Windows 98 reads partition data from the first 512 bytes of the partition itself and considers this more reliable data than the partition table.</P

><B
> </B
>This means that the partition table is inconsistent, and may be inaccurate.  Modifying a disk with an inaccurate partition table usually requires an expert to reduce the almost certain chance of data loss.</P
><P
>The severity of this message is dependent on the size of the disk.  Due to historical limitations, most (but not all) computer BIOSs only support disks with less than 1024 cylinders.  Booting the operating system depends on the bios, therefore (on such systems), the entire operating system must fit within this 1024 cylinders..  For the same historical reasons, the partition table format only supports reporting disk sizes of 1024 or less cylinders.  Many disks today have more than 1024 physical cylinders but by convention the partition table records exactly 1024 cylinders.  The operating system still needs to know where the actual partitions begin an end beyond the first 1024 cylinders and this is recorded in the partition table.</P
><P
>A large disk with more than 1024 cylinders will have a logical size (sum of partition sizes) that exceeds 1024 and matches the actual size, though the partition table reports a physical size of exactly 1024 cylinders.  In the case of a large disk, this message is essentially useless.</P

The applications loaded on most linux hosts varies with time and the tastes of the owner, so that they seldom match any distribution for more than a very brief period.</P

>In general, no.  For this reason, meticuluous care is required, especially at certain stages.  Some of the operations are idempotent. An idempotent operation is one which either fails and has no effect, or succeeds and has no effect after its first success.  Some of the operations are reversible.  A reversible operation has an inverse operation so that you can return things to what they were and start over.</P
><P
>Formatting is especially dangerous because it is neither idempotent nor reversible.  If formatting succeeds, the original data is lost.  If formatting fails, the original data is probably lost (since indices are usually destroyed early).</P

>A reader of this HOWTO presumably wants to benefit from the strengths of both Windows and linux, and suffer the shortcomings of neither.</P
><P
>Most linux distributions allow you to cleanly remove any package.  unix dialects support permissions so that each package gets a well defined share of the computer and this share can be identified and taken back in its entirety.  unix dialects support symbolic links so that the package can appear to be in a convenient place without actually occupying space from the convenient place.  The distributions that do not support easy removal are usually tiny specialized distributions like tomsrtbt.  The risk that an unwanted  package will plague your linux indefinitely is small since you can remove it at any time.</P
><P
>Most Windows packages can never be uninstalled cleanly under Windows, as they usually leave dll updates and registry entries.  It is therefore important to add packages only when you are sure that you need them, since your only way of removing them may be to reinstall Windows and every package that you want.</P
><P
>Sharing a machine between Windows and linux, means that linux can aid clean removal of packages from Windows.  Since it only identifies but does not predict, linux cannot insure clean removal.  Since linux find resolves to the second rather than Windows find to the day, it can much more accurately identify what was changed.</P

>A disk is a physical storage medium.  A disk must be formatted before data on the disk is accessible.  A municipal library building is a good model of a disk.  The building itslf has a fixed volume and can therefore hold a fixed number of books.  The largest number of books can be stored by simply dumping them inside the building, but the result would simply be a big trash pile and the books would not be available for use.  In order to use the books, they are placed on bookshelves so they can be accessed.  Placing the equivalent of bookshelves on the disk is called formatting</P

>An operating system is firmware that supports effective computter use.  As an allocator, the operating system verifies that only one process at a time controls the cpu , disk, write access to a file, and other unshareable resources.  As a toolkit, the operating system provides a set of software pieces for common functions (e.g. reading from a file, writing to the screen).  As a virtual machine, the operating system makes the physical computer behave like another well-specified computer, so that software can be written once for the well-specified computer and then run on many physical computers with compatible operating systems.  As an allocator, the operating system is like the staff that schedules the use of meeting rooms in the library.  As a toolkit, the operating system is like the library staff that reshelves books or the library copier.  As a virtual machine, the operating system is like one of the many libraries that endeaver to look like the U.S. Library of Congress with vertical bookshelves, a circular reference desk, and a lobby area with indices.  A patron entering any such library finds the layout familiar, and one patron can give usable directions to a patron of a different library.</P

>A disk is a physical portion of a disk.  A filesystem is a map between addresses and files accessed on the disk.  Most libraries are divided into floors or sections, such as Adult Fiction, Reference, and Juvenile Non-Fiction.  Each section usually has its own card catalog and often different sections use different schemes.  Adult Fiction is usually indexed by Author Name.  Reference is usually indexed by Subject.  There are even competing indexing schemes for the same section such as Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress.</P

The partition table also describes what filesystem is used in each partition.  The partition table is like the wall map that usually appears at the entry to any library.  This wall map tells where each section (e.g. Reference, Adult Fiction, Juvenile Non-fiction) is located and how the books are shelved (e.g. Title, Author, Dewey Decimal)</P

>Winmodems are a class of devices including winprinters, winscanners.  Winmodems are a subset of the class of devices that achieve low-cost by replacing hardware in their convential equivalents with firmware run by the host.  The drawback of these devices is that their dependence on the host usually slows or prohibits other operations simultaneously on the host.</P
><P
>By analogy low-cost headlights for an automobile might consist of a flashlight atop a battery tray that sits in the front passenger seat.  To use the headlights, you must start the car, remove the battery from the car, and install the car battery in the flashlight tray.  The headlight cost is reduced by the cost of the solenoid, dashboard switch,  wiring, and fuses.  If you use the headlights, the limitations mean that you can't carry a front passenger, you can't restart the car, you can't use the car radio, and the fuel guage reads empty.</P
><P
>Winmodems are distinct from the slightly larger class of these low-cost devices by the fact that they use proprietary firmware included in the Windows operating system.  In the United States, it is illegal to sell firmware to use this proprietary firmware without Microsoft consent.  At press time, the price of Microsoft consent is only slightly less than the cost of a convential device.</P
