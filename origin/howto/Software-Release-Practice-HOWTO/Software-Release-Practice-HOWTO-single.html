for other peoples' software before releasing projects of their own.
Suppose you've written a set of source-code changes for someone else's
baseline code. Now put yourself in that person's shoes. How is he
to judge whether to include the patch?</p><p>The truth is that it is very difficult to judge the quality of code.
So developers tend to evaluate patches by the quality of the submission.
They look for clues in the submitter's style and communications behavior
instead &#8212; indications that the person has been in their shoes and
understands what it's like to have to evaluate and merge an incoming patch.
</p><p>This is actually a pretty reliable proxy for code quality.  In many
years of dealing with patches from many hundreds of strangers, I have only
seldom seen a patch that was thoughtfully presented and respectful of my
time but technically bogus.  On the other hand, experience teaches me that
patches which look careless or are packaged in a lazy and inconsiderate way
are very likely to actually <span class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> bogus.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to get your patch accepted:</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm107"></a>2.1. Do send patches, don't send whole archives or files</h3></div></div></div><p>If your change includes a new file that doesn't exist in the code,
then of course you have to send the whole file.  But if you're modifying
an already-existing file, don't send the whole file.  Send a diff instead;
specifically, send the output of the 
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span>
command run to compare the baseline distributed version against your
modified version.</p><p>The diff command and its dual, 
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">patch</span>(1)</span>
(which automatically applies a diff to a baseline file)
are the most basic tools of open-source development.  Diffs are better
than whole files because the developer you're sending a patch to may
have changed the baseline version since you got your copy.  By sending
him a diff you save him the effort of separating your changes from his;
you show respect for his time.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm117"></a>2.2. Send patches against the current version of the code.</h3></div></div></div><p>It is both counterproductive and rude to send a maintainer
patches against the code as it existed several releases ago, and expect
him to do all the work of determining which changes duplicate things he
have since done, versus which things are actually novel in your patch.</p><p>As a patch submitter, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> responsibility
to track the state of the source and send the maintainer a minimal patch
that expresses what you want done to the main-line codebase. That means
sending a patch against the current version.</p><p>Nowadays effectively all open-source projects make their source code
available through public anonymous access to the project's version-control
repositrity. The most effective way to ensure that you're patching what's
current is to check the head version of the code out of the project's
repository. All version-control systems have a command that lets you
make a diff between your working copy and head; use that.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm123"></a>2.3. Don't include patches for generated files.</h3></div></div></div><p>Before you send your patch, walk through it and delete any
patch bands for files in it that are going to be automatically regenerated
once he applies the patch and remakes.  The classic examples of this
error are C files generated by <span class="application">Bison</span> 
or <span class="application">Flex</span>.</p><p>These days the most common mistake of this kind is sending a diff
with a huge band that is nothing but changebars between your
<span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script and his.  This file is generated by
<span class="command"><strong>autoconf</strong></span>.</p><p>This is inconsiderate.  It means your recipient is put to the trouble
of separating the real content of the patch from a lot of bulky noise.
It's a minor error, not as important as some of the things we'll get
to further on &#8212; but it will count against you.</p><p>You will probably avoid this automatically if you have checked out
the code from the project repo and use the version-control system's diff
command to generate your patch.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm133"></a>2.4. Don't send patch bands that just tweak version-control $-symbols.</h3></div></div></div><p>Some people put special tokens in their source files that are
expanded by the version-control system when the file is checked in: the
<span class="markup">$Id$</span> construct used by RCS, CVS, and
Subversion, for example.</p><p>If you're using a local version-control system yourself, your changes
may alter these tokens.  This isn't really harmful, because when your
recipient checks his code back in after applying your patch they'll get
re-expanded based on <span class="emphasis"><em>his</em></span> version-control status.  But
those extra patch bands are noise.  They're distracting.  It's more
considerate not to send them.</p><p>This is another minor error.  You'll be forgiven for it if you
get the big things right.  But you want to avoid it anyway.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm140"></a>2.5. Do use -c or -u format, don't use the default (-e) format</h3></div></div></div><p>The default (-e) format of
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">diff</span>(1)</span>
is very brittle.  It doesn't include any context, so the patch tool
can't cope if any lines have been inserted or deleted in the baseline 
code since you took the copy you modified.</p><p>Getting an -e diff is annoying, and suggests that the sender is
either an extreme newbie, careless, or clueless.  Most such patches
get tossed out without a second thought.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm147"></a>2.6. Do include documentation with your patch</h3></div></div></div><p>This is very important.  If your patch makes a user-visible addition
or change to the software's features, <span class="emphasis"><em>include changes to the
appropriate man pages and other documentation files in your patch</em></span>.
Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> assume that the recipient will be happy to
document your code for you, or else to have undocumented features lurking
in the code.</p><p>Documenting your changes well demonstrates some good things.  First,
it's considerate to the person you are trying to persuade.  Second, it
shows that you understand the ramifications of your change well enough
to explain it to somebody who can't see the code.  Third, it demonstrates
that you care about the people who will ultimately use the software.</p><p>Good documentation is usually the most visible sign of what separates
a solid contribution from a quick and dirty hack.  If you take the time
and care necessary to produce it, you'll find you're already 85% of the
way to having your patch accepted with most developers.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm154"></a>2.7. Do include an explanation with your patch</h3></div></div></div><p>Your patch should include cover notes explaining why you think the
patch is necessary or useful.  This is explanation directed not to the
users of the software but to the maintainer to whom you are sending the
patch.</p><p>The note can be short &#8212; in fact, some of the most effective
cover notes I've ever seen just said "See the documentation updates in this
patch".  But it should show the right attitude.</p><p>The right attitude is helpful, respectful of the maintainer's time,
quietly confident but unassuming.  It's good to display understanding of
the code you're patching.  It's good to show that you can identify with the
maintainer's problems. It's also good to be up front about any risks you
perceive in applying the patch.  Here are some examples of the sorts of
explanatory comments that I like to see in cover notes:</p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
I've seen two problems with this code, X and Y.  I fixed problem X, but I
didn't try addressing problem Y because I don't think I understand
the part of the code that I believe is involved.
</span>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
Fixed a core dump that can happen when one of the foo inputs is too long.
While I was at it, I went looking for similar overflows elsewhere.  I
found a possible one in blarg.c, near line 666.  Are you sure the sender
can't generate more than 80 characters per transmission?
</span>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
Have you considered using the Foonly algorithm for this problem?  There
is a good implementation at &lt;http://www.somesite.com/~jsmith/foonly.html&gt;.
</span>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
This patch solves the immediate problem, but I realize it complicates the
memory allocation in an unpleasant way.  Works for me, but you should 
probably test it under heavy load before shipping. 
</span>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
This may be featurititis, but I'm sending it anyway.  Maybe you'll know a
cleaner way to implement the feature.
</span>&#8221;</span></p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm169"></a>2.8. Do include useful comments in your code</h3></div></div></div><p>Usually as a maintainer, I will want to have strong confidence that I
understand your changes before merging them in.  This isn't an invariable
rule; if you have a track record of good work, with me I may just run a
casual eyeball over the changes before checking them in semi-automatically.
But everything you can do to help me understand your code and decrease my
uncertainty increases your chances that I will accept your patch.</p><p>Good comments in your code help me understand it.  Bad comments 
don't.</p><p>Here's an example of a bad comment:</p><pre class="programlisting">
/* norman newbie fixed this 13 Aug 2009 */
</pre><p>This conveys no information.  It's nothing but a muddy territorial 
bootprint you're planting in the middle of my code.  If I take your patch
(which you've made less likely) I'll almost certainly strip out this
comment.  If you want a credit, include a patch band for the project 
<code class="filename">NEWS</code> or <code class="filename">HISTORY</code> file.  I'll
probably take that.</p><p>Here's an example of a good comment:</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
 * This conditional needs to be guarded so that crunch_data()
 * never gets passed a NULL pointer.  &lt;norman_newbie@foosite.com&gt;
 */
</pre><p>This comment shows that you understand not only my code but the
kind of information that I need to have confidence in your changes.
This kind of comment <span class="emphasis"><em>gives</em></span> me confidence in your
changes.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm182"></a>2.9. Just one bugfix or new feature per patch.</h3></div></div></div><p>Don't gather various bugfixes, new features or other stuff and
send them as one single diff file. Instead, build a single diff for every
bugfix or feature. Every single diff should be generated using the current
version of the code and should not depend on any other patch you or someone
else sent before.</p><p>This helps the maintainer to read and understand your code, and he can
decide whether he wants to accept or abadon this single bugfix or feature.
For example, if you add a feature garanting full root access for everyone
because it's useful in your special setting, the maintainer will probably not
accept this part of your patch. When you send a single diff file confounding
this root access feature along with some bugfixes and other useful things, you
have a good chance the maintainer will ignore your complete patch.</p><p>With each bugfixes and new feature as a single diff file, the
maintainer could e.g. include your bugfixes in a few minutes and take later
a closer look to your new features or security issues.</p><p>Patches depending on other patches raise similar problems.  If the
maintainer rejects your basic patch, he won't be able to apply the
others. If you can't avoid such dependencies, offer to the maintainer that
you will bundle a patch with the sections or features he wants to
add.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="naming"></a>3. Good project- and archive- naming practice</h2></div></div></div><p>As the load on maintainers of archives like Metalab, the PSA
site and CPAN increases, there is an increasing trend for submissions
to be processed partly or wholly by programs (rather than entirely by
a human).</p><p>This makes it more important for project and archive-file names
to fit regular patterns that computer programs can parse and
understand.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm192"></a>3.1. Use GNU-style names with a stem and major.minor.patch numbering.</h3></div></div></div><p>It's helpful to everybody if your archive files all have GNU-like
names &#8212; all-lower-case alphanumeric stem prefix, followed by a dash,
followed by a version number, extension, and other suffixes.</p><p>Let's suppose you have a project you call `foobar' at version 1,
release 2, level 3.  If it's got just one archive part (presumably the

floating point numbers (e.g., you might see 1.303 rather than 1.3.3), and
the distributions are generally named Foo-Bar-1.303.tar.gz for version
1.303 of module Foo::Bar. (Perl itself, on the other hand, switched to

among your co-developers and users.  The copyright you put on the software
will function mainly as a legal assertion of your right to set license
terms on the software and derivative works of the software.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="copyrights"></a>4.1. Open source and copyrights</h3></div></div></div><p>Anything that is not public domain has a copyright, possibly more than
one.  Under the Berne Convention (which has been U.S. law since 1978),
the copyright does not have to be explicit.  That is, the authors of a
work hold copyright even if there is no copyright notice.</p><p> Who counts as an author can be very complicated, especially for
software that has been worked on by many hands.  This is why licenses
are important.  By setting out the terms under which material can be
used, they grant rights to the users that protect them from arbitrary
actions by the copyright holders.</p><p>In proprietary software, the license terms are designed to
protect the copyright.  They're a way of granting a few rights to
users while reserving as much legal territory is possible for the
owner (the copyright holder).  The copyright holder is very important,
and the license logic so restrictive that the exact technicalities of
the license terms are usually unimportant.</p><p>In open-source software, the situation is usually the exact opposite;
the copyright exists to protect the license.  The only rights the
copyright holder always keeps are to enforce the license.  Otherwise,
only a few rights are reserved and most choices pass to the user.  In
particular, the copyright holder cannot change the terms on a copy you
already have.  Therefore, in open-source software the copyright holder
is almost irrelevant &#8212; but the license terms are very important.</p><p>Normally the copyright holder of a project is the current
project leader or sponsoring organization.  Transfer of the project to
a new leader is often signaled by changing the copyright holder.
However, this is not a hard and fast rule; many open-source projects
have multiple copyright holders, and there is no instance on record of
this leading to legal problems.</p><p>Some projects choose to assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation,
on the theory that it has an interest in defending open source and lawyers
available to do it.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="opensource"></a>4.2. What qualifies as open source</h3></div></div></div><p>For licensing purposes, we can distinguish several different
kinds of rights that a license may convey.  Rights to <span class="emphasis"><em>copy
and redistribute</em></span>, rights to <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span>,
rights to <span class="emphasis"><em>modify for personal use</em></span>, and rights to
<span class="emphasis"><em>redistribute modified copies</em></span>.  A license may
restrict or attach conditions to any of these rights.</p><p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source
Initiative</a> is the result of a great deal of thought about what
makes software <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">open source</span>&#8221;</span> or (in older terminology)
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">free software</span>&#8221;</span>.  Its constraints on licensing require that:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>An unlimited right to copy be granted.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An unlimited right to use be granted.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An unlimited right to modify for personal use be granted.</p></li></ol></div><p>The guidelines prohibit restrictions on redistribution of
modified binaries; this meets the needs of software distributors, who
need to be able to ship working code without encumbrance.  It allows
authors to require that modified sources be redistributed as pristine
sources plus patches, thus establishing the author's intentions and an
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">audit trail</span>&#8221;</span> of any changes by others.</p><p>The OSD is the legal definition of the `OSI Certified Open Source'
certification mark, and as good a definition of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">free software</span>&#8221;</span> as
anyone has ever come up with.  All of the standard licenses (MIT, BSD,
Artistic, and GPL/LGPL) meet it (though some, like GPL, have other
restrictions which you should understand before choosing it).</p><p>Note that licenses which allow noncommercial use only do
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> qualify as open-source licenses, even if they
are decorated with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">GPL</span>&#8221;</span> or some other standard license.  They
discriminate against particular occupations, persons, and groups.

licenses.  The OSD is not a license itself; rather, it defines a
minimum set of rights that a license must guarantee in order to be
considered an open-source license.  The OSD, and supporting materials,
may be found at the web site of the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source Initiative</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="unoriginal"></a>5.3. Don't write your own license if you can possibly avoid it.</h3></div></div></div><p>The widely-known OSD-conformant licenses have well-established
interpretive traditions.  Developers (and, to the extent they care, users)
know what they imply, and have a reasonable take on the risks and tradeoffs
they involve.  Therefore, use one of the standard licenses carried on the
OSI site if at all possible.</p><p>If you must write your own license, be sure to have it certified
by OSI.  This will avoid a lot of argument and overhead.  Unless
you've been through it, you have no idea how nasty a licensing
flamewar can get; people become passionate because the licenses are
regarded as almost-sacred covenants touching the core values of the
open-source community.</p><p>Furthermore, the presence of an established interpretive tradition may
prove important if your license is ever tested in court.  At time of 
writing (early 2002) there is no case law either supporting or invalidating
any open-source license.  However, it is a legal doctrine (at least in
the U.S., and probably in other common-law countries such as England
and the rest of the British Commonwealth) that courts are supposed to 
interpret licenses and contracts according to the expectations and
practices of the community in which they originated.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="visible"></a>5.4. Make your license visible in a standard place.</h3></div></div></div><p>As larger and larger volumes of open-source software are deployed,
the problem of auditing these volumes for which licenses cover them become
nontrivial &#8212; in fact, it becomes larger than an unaided human being
can perform. Therefore, it is valuable to have conventions that support
mechanized querying of the licensing information. Fortunately, existing
community practise already tends in this direction.</p><p>As a beginning, the license information for your software should
live in a file named either COPYING or LICENSE in the top-level directory
of your source distribution.  If a single license applies to the entire
distribution, that file should include a copy of the license.  If multiple
licenses apply, that file should list the applicable licenses and
indicate to which files and subdirectories they apply.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="develpractice"></a>6. Good development practice</h2></div></div></div><p>Most of these are concerned with ensuring portability across all

information at compile-time. The user installing the package will not
necessarily know the answers to your questions, so this approach is doomed
from the start. Your software, calling the build system tools, must be able
to determine for itself any information that it may need at compile- or

becoming increasingly problematic because GNU autotools is showing its age.
Autotools was always a pile of crocks upon hacks upon kluges, implemented
in a messy mixture of languages and with some serious design flaws. The
resulting mess was tolerable for many years, but as projects become
more complex it is increasingly failing.</p><p>Still, people building from C sources expect to be able to type
"configure; make; make install" and get a clean build. Supposing you choose
a non-autotools system, you will probably want to emulate this behavior

Specifically, do use function prototypes, which will help you spot
cross-module inconsistencies.  The old-style K&amp;R compilers are
history.</p><p>Do not assume compiler-specific features such as the GCC "-pipe"
option or nested functions are available. These will come around and
bite you the second somebody ports to a non-Linux, non-GCC system.</p><p>Code required for portability should be isolated to a single area
and a single set of source files (for example, an "os" subdirectory).
Compiler, library and operating system interfaces with portability
issues should be abstracted to files in this directory. This includes
variables such as "errno", library interfaces such as "malloc", and
operating system interfaces such as "mmap".</p><p>Portability layers make it easier to do new software ports. It is
often the case that no member of the development team knows the porting
platform (for example, there are literally hundreds of different
embedded operating systems, and nobody knows any significant fraction
of them). By creating a separate portability layer it is possible for
someone who knows the port platform to port your software without having
to understand it.</p><p>Portability layers simplify applications. Software rarely needs
the full functionality of more complex system calls such as mmap or
stat, and programmers commonly configure such complex interfaces
incorrectly. A portability layer with abstracted interfaces
("__file_exists" instead of a call to stat) allows you to export only
the limited, necessary functionality from the system, simplifying the
code in your application.</p><p>Always write your portability layer to select based on a feature,
never based on a platform. Trying to create a separate portability layer
for each supported platform results in a multiple update problem
maintenance nightmare. A "platform" is always selected on at least two
axes: the compiler and the library/operating system release. In some
cases there are three axes, as when Linux vendors select a C library
independently of the operating system release. With M vendors, N
compilers and O operating system releases, the number of "platforms"
quickly scales out of reach of any but the largest development teams.
By using language and systems standards such as ANSI and POSIX 1003.1,
the set of features is relatively constrained.</p><p>Portability choices can be made along either lines of code or
compiled files. It doesn't make a difference if you select alternate
lines of code on a platform, or one of a few different files. A rule of
thumb is to move portability code for different platforms into separate
files when the implementations diverged significantly (shared memory
mapping on UNIX vs. Windows), and leave portability code in a single
file when the differences are minimal (using gettimeofday,
clock_gettime, ftime or time to find out the current
time-of-day).</p><p>Avoid using complex types such as "off_t" and "size_t". They vary
in size from system to system, especially on 64-bit systems. Limit your
usage of "off_t" to the portability layer, and your usage of "size_t"
to mean only the length of a string in memory, and nothing else.</p><p>Never step on the namespace of any other part of the system,
(including file names, error return values and function names).  Where
the namespace is shared, document the portion of the namespace that you
use.</p><p>Choose a coding standard. The debate over the choice of standard
can go on forever &#8212; regardless, it is too difficult and expensive to
maintain software built using multiple coding standards, and so some
coding standard must be chosen. Enforce your coding standard ruthlessly,
as consistency and cleanliness of the code are of the highest priority;
the details of the coding standard itself are a distant second.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="distpractice"></a>7. Good distribution-making practice</h2></div></div></div><p>These guidelines describe how your distribution should look when

happened to anyone yet, but best to be prepared).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="upgradeability"></a>7.4. Design for Upgradability</h3></div></div></div><p>Your software will change over time as you put out new releases.  Some
of these changes will not be backward-compatible.  Accordingly, you
should give serious thought to designing your installation layouts so
that multiple installed versions of your code can coexist on the same
system.  This is especially important for libraries &#8212; you can't 
count on all your client programs to upgrade in lockstep with your
API changes.</p><p>The Emacs, Python, and Qt projects have a good convention for handling
this; version-numbered directories.  Here's how an installed Qt
library hierarchy looks (${ver} is the version number):</p><pre class="screen">
/usr/lib/qt
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}/bin          # Where you find moc
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}/lib          # Where you find .so
/usr/lib/qt-${ver}/include      # Where you find header files
</pre><p>With this organization, you can have multiple versions
coexisting.  Client programs have to specify the library version they
want, but that's a small price to pay for not having the interfaces
break on them.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="checksums"></a>7.5. Provide checksums</h3></div></div></div><p>Provide checksums with your binaries (tarballs, RPMs, etc.).  This
will allow people to verify that they haven't been corrupted or had
Trojan-horse code inserted in them.</p><p>While there are several commands you can use for this purpose (such
as <span class="command"><strong>sum</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>cksum</strong></span>) it is best to use a
cryptographically-secure hash function.  The GPG package provides this
capability via the <code class="option">&#8212;detach-sign</code> option; so does the GNU
command <span class="command"><strong>md5sum</strong></span>.</p><p>For each binary you ship, your project web page should list
the checksum and the command you used to generate it.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="documentation"></a>8. Good documentation practice</h2></div></div></div><p>The most important good documentation practice is to actually
write some!  Too many programmers omit this.  But here are two good
reasons to do it:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Your documentation can be your design document.</em></span>
The best time to write it is before you type a single line of code,
while you're thinking out what you want to do.  You'll find that the
process of describing the way you want your program to work in natural
language focuses your mind on the high-level questions about  what it should
do and how it should work.  This may save you a lot of effort later.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Your documentation is an advertisement for the 
quality of your code.</em></span>
Many people take poor, scanty, or illiterate documentation for a program as
a sign that the programmer is sloppy or careless of potential users' needs.
Good documentation, on the other hand, conveys a message of intelligence
and professionalism. If your program has to compete with other programs,
better make sure your documentation is at least as good as theirs lest
potential users write you off without a second look.
</p></li></ol></div><p>This HOWTO wouldn't be the place for a course on technical writing
even if that were practical.  So we'll focus here on the formats and tools
available for composing and rendering documentation.</p><p>Though Unix and the open-source community have a long tradition of
hosting powerful document-formatting tools, the plethora of different
formats has meant that documentation has tended to be fragmented and
difficult for users to browse or index in a coherent way.
We'll summarize the uses, strengths, and weaknesses of the common 
documentation formats. Then we'll make some recommendations for good
practice.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="docpractice"></a>8.1. Documentation formats</h3></div></div></div><p>Here are the documentation markup formats now in widespread use among
open-source developers.  When we speak of "presentation" markup, we mean
markup that controls the document's appearance explicitly (such as a font
change).  When we speak of "structural" markup, we mean markup that
describes the logical structure of the document (like a section break or
emphasis tag.)  And when we speak of "indexing", we mean the process 
of extracting from a collection of documents a searchable collection
of topic pointers that users can employ to reliably find material
of interest across the entire collection.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">man pages</span></dt><dd><p>The most common format, inherited from Unix, a primitive form of
presentation markup.
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">man</span>(1)</span>
command provides a pager and a stone-age search facility.  No support for
images or hyperlinks or indexing. Renders to Postscript for printing fairly
well.  Doesn't render to HTML at all well (essentially as flat text).
Tools are preinstalled on all Linux systems.</p><p>Man page format is not bad for command summaries or short reference
documents intended to jog the memory of an experienced user.  It starts to
creak under the strain for programs with complex interfaces and many
options, and collapses entirely if you need to maintain a set of documents
with rich cross-references (the markup has only weak and normally unused
support for hyperlinks).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">HTML</span></dt><dd><p>Increasingly common since the Web exploded in 1993-1994. Markup is
partly structural, mostly presentation. Browseable through any web browser.
Good support for images and hyperlinks.  Limited built-in facilities for
indexing, but good indexing and search-engine technologies exist and are
widely deployed.  Renders to Postscript for printing pretty well.  HTML
tools are now universally available.</p><p>HTML is very flexible and suitable for many kinds of documentation.
Actually, it's <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> flexible; it shares with man page
format the problem that it's hard to index automatically because a lot of the 
markup describes presentation rather than document structure.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Texinfo</span></dt><dd><p>Texinfo is the documentation format used by the Free Software
Foundation. It's a set of macros on top of the powerful TeX formatting
engine. Mostly structural, partly presentation.  Browseable through Emacs
or a standalone <span class="command"><strong>info</strong></span> program.  Good support for
hyperlinks, none for images.  Good indexing for both print and on-line
forms; when you install a Texinfo document, a pointer to it is
automatically added to a browsable "dir" document listing all the Texinfo
documents on your system.  Renders to excellent Postscript and useable
HTML.  Texinfo tools are preinstalled on most Linux systems, and available
at the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">Free Software Foundation</a>
website.</p><p>Texinfo is a good design, quite usable for typesetting books as well
as small on-line documents, but like HTML it's a sort of amphibian &#8212; the
markup is part structural, part presentation, and the presentation part
creates problems for rendering. </p></dd><dt><span class="term">DocBook</span></dt><dd><p>DocBook is a large, elaborate markup format based on SGML (more
recent versions on XML).  Unlike the other formats described here it is
entirely structural with no presentation markup.  Excellent support for
images and hyperlinks.  Good support for indexing.  Renders well to HTML,
acceptably to Postscript for printing (quality is improving as the tools
evolve).  Tools and documentation are available at the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.docbook.org/" target="_top">DocBook website</a>.</p><p>DocBook is excellent for large, complex documents; it was designed
specifically to support technical manuals and rendering them in multiple
output formats.  Its main drawback is its verbosity.  Fortunately, good
tools and introductory-level documentation are now available; see the
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/DocBook-Demystification-HOWTO/" target="_top">DocBook Demystification
HOWTO</a> for an introduction.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">asciidoc</span></dt><dd><p>The one serious drawback of DocBook is that its markup is rather
heavyweight and obtrusive.  A clever recent workaround is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/" target="_top">AsciiDOC</a>. This tool is a
front end to DocBook with a much simpler and more natural input
syntax. Users don't need to be aware of DocBook at all, but still get
nearly the full power of those tools.</p><p>AsciiDOC (often referred to by the all-lower-case name of the
formatter it ships) has been seeing very rapid uptake recently by 
projects which had previously moved to DocBook.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm547"></a>8.2. Good practice recommendations</h3></div></div></div><p>Documentation practice has been changing since 2000, when some key
open-source project groups (including the Linux kernel project, GNOME, KDE,
the Free Software Foundation, and the Linux Documentation Project) agreed
on an approach more web-friendly than traditional Unix's print-oriented
tools.  Today's best practice, since the XML-DocBook toolchain reached
production status in mid-2001, is this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Maintain your document masters in either XML-DocBook or asciidoc.
Even your man pages can be DocBook <code class="sgmltag-element">RefEntry</code> documents.
There is a very good <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Man-Page.html" target="_top">HOWTO</a>
on writing manual pages that explains the sections and organization your
users will expect to see.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ship the XML or asciidoc masters.  Also, in case your users' systems don't have
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">xmlto</span>(1)</span>
(standard on all Red Hat distributions since 7.3), ship the troff sources
that you get by running conversions on your masters. Your
software distribution's installation procedure should install those in
the normal way, but direct people to the XML/asciidoc files if they want to write
documentation patches.</p><p>It's easy to tell <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">make</span>(1)</span> to keep the generated man files up
to date.  Just do something like this in your makefile:</p><pre class="programlisting">
foo.1: foo.xml
	xmlto man foo.xml
</pre><p>If you're using asciidoc, something like this should serve:</p><pre class="programlisting">
foo.1: foo.txt
	asciidoc --backend=docbook foo.txt
	xmlto man foo.xml
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>Generate XHTML from your masters (with <span class="command"><strong>xmlto
xhtml</strong></span>, or directly using <span class="command"><strong>asciidoc</strong></span>) and make it
available from your project's web page, where people can browse it in order
to decide whether to download your code and join your project.</p></li></ol></div><p>For converting legacy documentation in troff formats to DocBook,
check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr//doclifter/" target="_top">doclifter</a>. If you're
unwilling to move from using man sources as a master format, at least try
to clean them up so <span class="application">doclifter</span> can lift them
to XML automatically.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="communication"></a>9. Good communication practice</h2></div></div></div><p>Your software and documentation won't do the world much good if
