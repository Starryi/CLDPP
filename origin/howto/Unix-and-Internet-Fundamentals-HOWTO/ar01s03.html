electronics.  The first thing a computer has to do when it is turned on is
start up a special program called an <a name="os"></a><em class="firstterm">operating
system</em>.  The operating system's job is to help other computer
programs to work by handling the messy details of controlling the
computer's hardware.</p><p>The process of bringing up the operating system is called <a name="boot"></a> <em class="firstterm">booting</em> (originally this was
<em class="firstterm">bootstrapping</em> and alluded to the process of pulling
yourself up <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">by your bootstraps</span>&#8221;</span>).  Your computer knows how to
boot because instructions for booting are built into one of its chips, the
BIOS (or Basic Input/Output System) chip.</p><p>The BIOS chip tells it to look in a fixed place, usually on the
lowest-numbered hard disk (the <em class="firstterm">boot disk</em>) for a
special program called a <em class="firstterm">boot loader</em> (under Linux the
boot loader is called Grub or LILO).  The boot loader is pulled into memory and
started.  The boot loader's job is to start the real operating
system.</p><p>The loader does this by looking for a
<em class="firstterm">kernel</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm98"></a>,
loading it into memory, and starting it.  If you Linux and see
"LILO" on the screen followed by a bunch of dots, it is loading the kernel.
(Each dot means it has loaded another <a name="diskblock"></a><em class="firstterm">disk
block</em> of kernel code.)</p><p>(You may wonder why the BIOS doesn't load the kernel directly &#8212;
why the two-step process with the boot loader?  Well, the BIOS isn't very
smart.  In fact it's very stupid, and Linux doesn't use it at all after
boot time.  It was originally written for primitive 8-bit PCs with tiny
disks, and literally can't access enough of the disk to load the kernel
directly.  The boot loader step also lets you start one of several
operating systems off different places on your disk, in the unlikely event
that Unix isn't good enough for you.)</p><p>Once the kernel starts, it has to look around, find the rest of the
hardware, and get ready to run programs.  It does this by poking not at
ordinary memory locations but rather at <em class="firstterm">I/O ports</em>
&#8212; special bus addresses that are likely to have device controller
cards listening at them for commands.  The kernel doesn't poke at random;
it has a lot of built-in knowledge about what it's likely to find where,
and how controllers will respond if they're present.  This process is
called
<em class="firstterm">autoprobing</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm106"></a>.</p><p>You may or may not be able to see any of this going on.  Back when
Unix systems used text consoles, you'd see boot messages scroll by on your
screen as the system started up.  Nowawadays, Unixes often hide the boot
messages behind a graphical splash screen. You may be able to see them by
switching to a text console view with the key combination Ctrl-Shift-F1. If
this works, you should be able to switch back to the graphical boot screen
with a different Ctrl-Shift sequence; try F7, F8, and F9.</p><p>Most of the messages emitted boot time are the kernel autoprobing
your hardware through the I/O ports, figuring out what it has available to
it and adapting itself to your machine.  The Linux kernel is extremely good
at this, better than most other Unixes and <em class="firstterm">much</em> better
than DOS or Windows.  In fact, many Linux old-timers think the cleverness
of Linux's boot-time probes (which made it relatively easy to install) was
a major reason it broke out of the pack of free-Unix experiments to attract
a critical mass of users.</p><p>But getting the kernel fully loaded and running isn't the end of the
boot process; it's just the first stage (sometimes called <em class="firstterm">run
level 1</em>).  After this first stage, the kernel hands control to a
special process called &#8216;init&#8217; which spawns several housekeeping
processes. (Some recent Linuxes use a different program called
&#8216;upstart&#8217; that does similar things)</p><p>The init process's first job is usually to check to make sure your disks
are OK.  Disk file systems are fragile things; if they've been damaged by a
hardware failure or a sudden power outage, there are good reasons to take
recovery steps before your Unix is all the way up.  We'll go into some of
this later on when we talk about <a class="link" href="ar01s10.html#fsck" title="10.6. How things can go wrong">how file systems can
go wrong</a>.</p><p>Init's next step is to start several <em class="firstterm">daemons</em>.  A
daemon is a program like a print spooler, a mail listener or a WWW server
that lurks in the background, waiting for things to do.  These special
programs often have to coordinate several requests that could conflict.
They are daemons because it's often easier to write one program that runs
constantly and knows about all requests than it would be to try to make
sure that a flock of copies (each processing one request and all running at
the same time) don't step on each other.  The particular collection of
daemons your system starts may vary, but will almost always include a print
spooler (a gatekeeper daemon for your printer).</p><p>The next step is to prepare for users.  Init starts a copy of a
program called <span class="command"><strong>getty</strong></span> to watch your screen and keyboard
(and maybe more copies to watch dial-in serial ports).  Actually, nowadays
it usually starts multiple copies of <span class="command"><strong>getty</strong></span> so you have
several (usually 7 or 8) virtual consoles, with your screen and keyboards
connected to one of them at a time.  But you likely won't see any of these,
because one of your consoles will be taken over by the X server (about
which more in a bit).</p><p>We're not done yet.  The next step is to start up various daemons
that support networking and other services. The most important of these is
your X server.  X is a daemon that manages your display, keyboard, and
mouse.  Its main job is to produce the color pixel graphics you normally
see on your screen.</p><p>When the X server comes up, during the last part of your machine's
boot process, it effectively takes over the hardware from whatever virtual
console was previously in control.  That's when you'll see a graphical
login screen, produced for you by a program called a <em class="firstterm">display
manager</em>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2. Basic anatomy of your computer </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 4. What happens when you log in?</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
