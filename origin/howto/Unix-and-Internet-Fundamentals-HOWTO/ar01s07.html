Computers can only do one task (or
<em class="firstterm">process</em>) at a time.  But a computer can change tasks
very rapidly, and fool slow human beings into thinking it's doing several
things at once.  This is called
<em class="firstterm">timesharing</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm200"></a>.</p><p>One of the kernel's jobs is to manage timesharing.  It has a part
called the
<em class="firstterm">scheduler</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm204"></a>
which keeps information inside itself about all the other (non-kernel)
processes in your zoo.  Every 1/60th of a second, a timer goes off in the
kernel, generating a clock interrupt.  The scheduler stops whatever process
is currently running, suspends it in place, and hands control to another
process.</p><p>1/60th of a second may not sound like a lot of time.  But on today's
microprocessors it's enough to run tens of thousands of machine
instructions, which can do a great deal of work.  So even if you have many
processes, each one can accomplish quite a bit in each of its
timeslices.</p><p>In practice, a program may not get its entire timeslice. If an
interrupt comes in from an I/O device, the kernel effectively stops the
current task, runs the interrupt handler, and then returns to the current
task.  A storm of high-priority interrupts can squeeze out normal
processing; this misbehavior is called <em class="firstterm">thrashing</em> and
is fortunately very hard to induce under modern Unixes.</p><p>In fact, the speed of programs is only very seldom limited by the
amount of machine time they can get (there are a few exceptions to this
rule, such as sound or 3-D graphics generation).  Much more often, delays
are caused when the program has to wait on data from a disk drive or
network connection.</p><p>An operating system that can routinely support many simultaneous
processes is called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">multitasking</span>&#8221;</span>.  The Unix family of operating
systems was designed from the ground up for multitasking and is very good
at it &#8212; much more effective than Windows or the old Mac OS, which both
had multitasking bolted into them as an afterthought and do it rather poorly.
Efficient, reliable multitasking is a large part of what makes Linux
superior for networking, communications, and Web service.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">6. How do input devices and interrupts work? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 8. How does my computer keep processes from stepping on each other?</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
