On modern
Unixes you will usually do this through a graphical display manager. But
it's possible to switch virtual consoles with a Ctrl-Shift key sequence and
do a textual login, too. In that case you go through the
<span class="command"><strong>getty</strong></span> instance watching that console to call the
program <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span>.</p><p>You identify yourself to the display manager or
<span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> with a login name and password.  That login name
is looked up in a file called /etc/passwd, which is a sequence of lines
each describing a user account.</p><p>One of these fields is an encrypted version of the account password
(sometimes the encrypted fields are actually kept in a second /etc/shadow
file with tighter permissions; this makes password cracking harder).  What
you enter as an account password is encrypted in exactly the same way, and
the <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> program checks to see if they match.  The
security of this method depends on the fact that, while it's easy to go
from your clear password to the encrypted version, the reverse is very
hard.  Thus, even if someone can see the encrypted version of your
password, they can't use your account.  (It also means that if you forget
your password, there's no way to recover it, only to change it to something
else you choose.)</p><p>Once you have successfully logged in, you get all the privileges
associated with the individual account you are using.  You may also be
recognized as part of a
<em class="firstterm">group</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm134"></a>.
A group is a named collection of users set up by the system administrator.
Groups can have privileges independently of their members&#8217; privileges.  A
user can be a member of multiple groups.  (For details about how Unix
privileges work, see the section below on <a class="link" href="ar01s10.html#permissions" title="10.5. File ownership, permissions and security">permissions</a>.)</p><p>(Note that although you will normally refer to users and groups by
name, they are actually stored internally as numeric IDs.  The password
file maps your account name to a user ID; the
<code class="filename">/etc/group</code><a class="indexterm" name="idm139"></a>
file maps group names to numeric group IDs.  Commands that deal with
accounts and groups do the translation automatically.)</p><p>Your account entry also contains your <em class="firstterm">home
directory</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm143"></a>, the place in the Unix file system where
your personal files will live.  Finally, your account entry also sets your
<em class="firstterm">shell</em><a class="indexterm" name="idm146"></a>,
the command interpreter that <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> will start up to
accept your commmands.</p><p>What happens after you have successfully logged in depends on how you
did it. On a text console, <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> will launch a shell
and you'll be off and running.  If you logged in through a display
manager, the X server will bring up your graphical desktop and you will
be able to run programs from it &#8212; either through the menus, or
through desktop icons, or through a <em class="firstterm">terminal
emulator</em> running a <em class="firstterm">shell</em>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3. What happens when you switch on a computer? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5. What happens when you run programs
