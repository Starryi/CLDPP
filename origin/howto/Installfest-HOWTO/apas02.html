      You may want to consider having users sign some kind of agreement 
      before any work
      is performed on their systems. Such a document will make it clear to 
      users exactly what they can and cannot expect from the installfest.
      </p><p>
      If you do decide to use one of these documents, please
      have it reviewed by a lawyer in your area. 
      </p><p>
      If you do have an agreement approved by a lawyer, 
      please contribute to the Linux community by sending a copy
      to the lead author of this HOWTO so that it may be included in
      future versions.

        The following is a significantly modified version of a form posted on 
        David Pitts's Web site.
        </p><p>INSTALLFEST RELEASE FORM</p><p>
        By signing this release agreement
        between you and the group holding the installfest (members of the
        __________________________ Linux User's Group, hereinafter 
        referred to as
        Installers), you give up certain legal rights. Therefore, you should
        read the agreement carefully. If you have any questions about the
        legal effect of this agreement, you should consult an attorney and
        not any of the Installers. Please be aware that you may not participate
        in the installfest event unless you have signed this agreement.
        By signing this release agreement, you
        acknowledge the following: 
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            That your signing this agreement
            is partial consideration for the services provided by Installers. 
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            That Installers do not promise
            that the work done on your computer equipment will be successful.
            An Installer will help you attempt to install, configure, or
            otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on your computer
            equipment. However, because of possible defects in computer
            software or computer hardware, including improperly configured
            computer hardware, not every attempt is successful. 
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            That the attempt to install,
            configure, or otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on
            your computer equipment has inherent dangers that no amount of
            care, caution, instruction, or expertise can eliminate. 
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            That any attempt to install,
            configure, or otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on
            your computer equipment, especially including any attempt to
            partition or re-partition your computer's hard drive, may result in
            the loss of some or all of the data stored on that hard drive. That
            you are hereby advised that you should back up all important data
            before the attempt to install, configure or otherwise get the Linux
            operating system to work on your computer equipment. 
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            That an installfest is an inherently chaotic event at which
            many computer components, peripherals and systems are present;
            therefore, you are responsible for the security of your property.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            That you are expressly assuming
            the risks of the dangers set forth above. 
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            That by signing this release agreement, you hereby forever
            release the Installers from any legal liability they might have
            arising from the attempt to install, configure, or otherwise get
            the Linux operating system to run on your computer equipment. That
            this release includes, but is not limited to, any losses caused by
            the negligence of any Installer who attempts to install, configure
            or otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on your
            computer.

        I, _______________________________ acknowledge that I am participating
        in the "Linux Install Festival" entirely at my own risk. 
        I assume
        responsibility for the integrity of the data on my computer system,
        have backed up all important data, and I will hold the volunteer
        helpers blameless for any damage to my computer system, to my data, or
        any other damages or liability that may result through my
        participation in this event. I further agree to be responsible for any
        licensing fees, shareware registrations, or other licensing
        requirements that may apply to the software I will receive. The
        purpose of this event is to distribute software packages that are Open
        Source, legally distributable with no charge to the user.
        </p><p>
        Every reasonable effort will be made to ensure that my system operates
        correctly before and after the installation, but I recognize that,
        because the software installed at this event is licensed free of
        charge, the copyright holder(s) and volunteer helpers and/or other
        parties provide this material "as is" without 
        warranty of any kind,

        software, and the accuracy of its associated documentation, is with
        me. Should this software or its associated documentation prove
