    This HOWTO has three sections for things you should think about or do
    <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>during</em></span>
    and <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> 
    the day of the installfest. It is assumed
    that you will be having installfests periodically and hopefully regularly.

        In order to reach the most people, fests should be held
        on both weekends and weekdays. The time of day is not
        as important as the duration of the fest, which should
        be 6 to 10 hours. Here is why:
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              some people will not be able to arrive when the fest starts 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              it takes time to get systems moved in, connected,
              disconnected and moved out of the working area
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              making sub-systems like sound, printers and other
              peripherals function
              properly sometimes takes as long as a Linux installation
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              some people want to get some life out of older CPUs but
              OS installation takes longer on slower machines
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="Location"></a>3.1.2. location</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Make sure that the place where your installfest will be held has:
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">strong tables</span></dt><dd><p>
                Each table may have to hold multiple monitors and computers.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">restrooms</span></dt><dd><p></p></dd><dt><span class="term">chairs</span></dt><dd><p>
                People will want to sit down since they will be at 
                the fest for several hours.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Internet access</span></dt><dd><p>
                Some people will want to know that they can access the
                Internet from their computer. Some people will need 
                to download drivers or other software. A lot of helpful
                information is available on the Net. There is a list of
                Web sites at the end of this document.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">an address that is easy to find</span></dt><dd><p>
                A map and simple directions will help.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">an easy way to get hardware in and out</span></dt><dd><p>
                How will people bring their hardware from their cars
                to the installation room? Are 
                carts and elevators available?
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">sufficient AC power</span></dt><dd><p>
                Try to make sure that you have
                enough power for the number of computers that you 
                expect people to bring. You do not want people
                to suddenly lose power because one person too many
                turned on his or her computer.
                </p><p>
                How much power does a computer need?
                Laptops need about 0.5 amps.
                For a desktop/tower/workstation type of computer
                the amount of power needed depends on the monitor, 
                number of disk drives, etc.
                Basically though, if everything is connected to one
                power strip, then they need at most 3 to 4 amps at the moment
                that the power is turned on and 1.5 to 2 amps while
                they are running.
                </p><p>
                You should try to have access to the circuit breakers 
                either directly or 
                through readily available maintenance staff.
                </p></dd></dl></div><p>
        </p><p>
        If you are lucky you will be able to make arrangements to
        regularly hold installfests at
        a few locations that meet your needs. If possible you should 
        hold your fests at a variety of locations such as 
        technical colleges, universities and businesses because 
        Linux is for everyone.

          </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Linux distributions (distros)</span></dt><dd><p>
                Make sure that you will have several copies of the latest
                versions of the major Linux distributions available
                on CD. To learn which distributions to make available, please 
                do a little research on the Web sites listed in the 
                appendix of this document.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">installfest server</span></dt><dd><p>
                You may want to consider setting up a server for:
                  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>DNS</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>DHCP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>mirrors of distributions</p></li></ul></div><p>
                </p><p>
                You should provide multiple methods of 
                accessing the distributions on the server:
                  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>FTP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>rcp</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>HTTP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>CD burning</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>NFS</p></li></ul></div><p>
                </p><p>
                In order to conserve disk space
                you can create a virtual CD-ROM jukebox. 
                See Randolph J. Tata's "CDServer-HOWTO"
                (<a class="ulink" href="http://talcon.com/cdserver-howto/" target="_top">

                Hopefully someone will create a new Linux distribution to make
                it easy to set up such a server.

                      that if they wish to install a Linux

                      monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers, USB devices, 
                      power strip. Support people will need all the components

                      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                      that they may want to bring blank CD-R media

                Some people will want to install Linux on very old/slow 
                systems in an attempt to make them usable. This is OK,
                but there are limitations. Please look at the
                distributions area of 
                <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux.org" target="_top">
                www.linux.org</a> 
                for minimalist distributions. 

                You may want to include minimum system requirements 
                in your installfest advertisement so that people do
                not show up with an old machine, hoping to turn it
                into a power-house but leave disappointed.

                You should have a few signs posted to help people
                find their way around the location and provide other 
                information. Some examples are:

                Due to the duration of an installfest you should  
                consider the availability of food and drink.
                </p><p>
                Pizza usually works out well.
                Tell people that you will be collecting a specific amount
                of money at the door for pizza. If they 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> want to
                share some pizza, then they 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> need to pay.
                In order to know who has paid, use an ink stamp to
                mark their hand. Do not forget paper plates and napkins.
                </p><p>
                If there are no vending machines at the 
                location you may want to
                provide soft drinks, including water and possibly coffee
                during the fest. If you do provide drinks, you should
                consider selling them at cost.

              The people who run the fest need to be at the location at

            Look for: items people have forgotten, items that people
