    This document provides some guidelines that should help you
    run a successful installfest. 
    For purposes of this document, an installfest is a gathering at
    which experienced Linux users assist less experienced users with the
    installation and configuration of Linux distributions,
    and where Linux users can
    bring Linux systems to receive assistance with system problem
    remediation.
    </p><p>
    Please take from this document whatever you want. It is meant to be
    a guide, not a recipe that must be followed exactly 
    to have a successful installfest.
    Any installfest where most of the people leave happy is a 
    successful event.

    This HOWTO has three sections for things you should think about or do
    <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>during</em></span>
    and <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> 
    the day of the installfest. It is assumed
    that you will be having installfests periodically and hopefully regularly.

        In order to reach the most people, fests should be held
        on both weekends and weekdays. The time of day is not
        as important as the duration of the fest, which should
        be 6 to 10 hours. Here is why:
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              some people will not be able to arrive when the fest starts 
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              it takes time to get systems moved in, connected,
              disconnected and moved out of the working area
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              making sub-systems like sound, printers and other
              peripherals function
              properly sometimes takes as long as a Linux installation
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              some people want to get some life out of older CPUs but
              OS installation takes longer on slower machines
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="Location"></a>3.1.2. location</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Make sure that the place where your installfest will be held has:
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">strong tables</span></dt><dd><p>
                Each table may have to hold multiple monitors and computers.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">restrooms</span></dt><dd><p></p></dd><dt><span class="term">chairs</span></dt><dd><p>
                People will want to sit down since they will be at 
                the fest for several hours.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Internet access</span></dt><dd><p>
                Some people will want to know that they can access the
                Internet from their computer. Some people will need 
                to download drivers or other software. A lot of helpful
                information is available on the Net. There is a list of
                Web sites at the end of this document.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">an address that is easy to find</span></dt><dd><p>
                A map and simple directions will help.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">an easy way to get hardware in and out</span></dt><dd><p>
                How will people bring their hardware from their cars
                to the installation room? Are 
                carts and elevators available?
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">sufficient AC power</span></dt><dd><p>
                Try to make sure that you have
                enough power for the number of computers that you 
                expect people to bring. You do not want people
                to suddenly lose power because one person too many
                turned on his or her computer.
                </p><p>
                How much power does a computer need?
                Laptops need about 0.5 amps.
                For a desktop/tower/workstation type of computer
                the amount of power needed depends on the monitor, 
                number of disk drives, etc.
                Basically though, if everything is connected to one
                power strip, then they need at most 3 to 4 amps at the moment
                that the power is turned on and 1.5 to 2 amps while
                they are running.
                </p><p>
                You should try to have access to the circuit breakers 
                either directly or 
                through readily available maintenance staff.
                </p></dd></dl></div><p>
        </p><p>
        If you are lucky you will be able to make arrangements to
        regularly hold installfests at
        a few locations that meet your needs. If possible you should 
        hold your fests at a variety of locations such as 
        technical colleges, universities and businesses because 
        Linux is for everyone.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="Administration"></a>3.1.3. administration</h4></div></div></div><p>

                Make sure that you will have several copies of the latest
                versions of the major Linux distributions available
                on CD. To learn which distributions to make available, please 
                do a little research on the Web sites listed in the 
                appendix of this document.
                </p></dd><dt><span class="term">installfest server</span></dt><dd><p>
                You may want to consider setting up a server for:
                  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>DNS</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>DHCP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>mirrors of distributions</p></li></ul></div><p>
                </p><p>
                You should provide multiple methods of 
                accessing the distributions on the server:
                  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>FTP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>rcp</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>HTTP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>CD burning</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>NFS</p></li></ul></div><p>

                In order to conserve disk space
                you can create a virtual CD-ROM jukebox. 
                See Randolph J. Tata's "CDServer-HOWTO"

                Hopefully someone will create a new Linux distribution to make

                Some people will want to install Linux on very old/slow 
                systems in an attempt to make them usable. This is OK,
                but there are limitations. Please look at the
                distributions area of 
                <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux.org" target="_top">
                www.linux.org</a> 
                for minimalist distributions. 

                You may want to include minimum system requirements 
                in your installfest advertisement so that people do
                not show up with an old machine, hoping to turn it
                into a power-house but leave disappointed.

                You should have a few signs posted to help people
                find their way around the location and provide other 
                information. Some examples are:

                      reception desk:
                      People will need to find the reception desk from the

                Due to the duration of an installfest you should  
                consider the availability of food and drink.
                </p><p>
                Pizza usually works out well.
                Tell people that you will be collecting a specific amount
                of money at the door for pizza. If they 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> want to
                share some pizza, then they 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> need to pay.
                In order to know who has paid, use an ink stamp to
                mark their hand. Do not forget paper plates and napkins.
                </p><p>
                If there are no vending machines at the 
                location you may want to
                provide soft drinks, including water and possibly coffee
                during the fest. If you do provide drinks, you should
                consider selling them at cost.

        By signing this release agreement
        between you and the group holding the installfest (members of the
        __________________________ Linux User's Group, hereinafter 
        referred to as
        Installers), you give up certain legal rights. Therefore, you should
        read the agreement carefully. If you have any questions about the
        legal effect of this agreement, you should consult an attorney and
        not any of the Installers. Please be aware that you may not participate
        in the installfest event unless you have signed this agreement.
        By signing this release agreement, you
        acknowledge the following:

            That Installers do not promise
            that the work done on your computer equipment will be successful.
            An Installer will help you attempt to install, configure, or
            otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on your computer
            equipment. However, because of possible defects in computer
            software or computer hardware, including improperly configured
            computer hardware, not every attempt is successful.

            care, caution, instruction, or expertise can eliminate.

            partition or re-partition your computer's hard drive, may result in
            the loss of some or all of the data stored on that hard drive. That
            you are hereby advised that you should back up all important data
            before the attempt to install, configure or otherwise get the Linux
            operating system to work on your computer equipment.

            That by signing this release agreement, you hereby forever

            the Linux operating system to run on your computer equipment. That
            this release includes, but is not limited to, any losses caused by
            the negligence of any Installer who attempts to install, configure

    </h3><p>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
      functional and useful document &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense of freedom:
      to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
      or without modifying it, either commercially or
      noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
      publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
      responsible for modifications made by others.
    </p><p>
      This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means that
      derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
      sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
      license designed for free software.
    </p><p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
      software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
      should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
      does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
      for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
      published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
      works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

      refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
      and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;. You accept the license if you copy,
      modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
      copyright law.
    </p><p>
      A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing
      the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.
    </p><p>
      A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#8217;s overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
      with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
      philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
    </p><p>
      The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
      that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
      does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
      be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
      Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
      there are none.
    </p><p>
      The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
      that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
      be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    </p><p>
      A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
      not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
      not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
    </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
      without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
      using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
      image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
      formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
      SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
      available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
      some word processors for output purposes only.
    </p><p>
      The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the title page
      itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
      material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
      formats which do not have any title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221;
      means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#8217;s
      title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    </p><p>
      The &#8220;publisher&#8221; means any person or entity that distributes
      copies of the Document to the public.
    </p><p>
      A section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
      &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, &#8220;Dedications&#8221;,
      &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;.) To &#8220;Preserve
      the Title&#8221; of such a section when you modify the Document means that
      it remains a section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this
      definition.
    </p><p>
      The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
      states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.
    </p><h3><a name="section2"></a>
      2. VERBATIM COPYING
    </h3><p>
      You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
      notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
      Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
      measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
      copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
      exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
      must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    </p><p>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
      may publicly display copies.
    </p><h3><a name="section3"></a>
      3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    </h3><p>
      If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
      printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document&#8217;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
      Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
      back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
      the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
      these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
    </p><p>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
      you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
      actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
    </p><p>
      If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
      than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
      along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
      access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
      Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
      latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
      distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
      copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
      through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
    </p><p>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
      Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
      them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    </p><h3><a name="section4"></a>
      4. MODIFICATIONS
    </h3><p>
      You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
      conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
      Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
      filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
      modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
      addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem">
          Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
          from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
          should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
          Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
          original publisher of that version gives permission.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
          responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
          Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
          Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
          unless they release you from this requirement.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
          Version, as the publisher.

          Page. If there is no section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
          of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
          describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
          public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
          network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
          based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221;
          section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
          at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
          publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          For any section Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; or

          preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
          contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
          their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are

        </li><li class="listitem">
          Delete any section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;. Such a section

          Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          &#8220;Endorsements&#8221; or to conflict in title with any Invariant

        </li><li class="listitem">
          Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
        </li></ol></div><p>
      If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
      that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
      Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
      as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
      Sections in the Modified Version&#8217;s license notice. These titles
      must be distinct from any other section titles.
    </p><p>
      You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties &#8212; for example, statements of peer review or that the text
      has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.
    </p><p>
      You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
      passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
      Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
      and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
      by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
      same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
      entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
      replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
      that added the old one.
    </p><p>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
      permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
      endorsement of any Modified Version.
    </p><h3><a name="section5"></a>
      5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    </h3><p>
      You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
      License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
      provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
      of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
      Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
      you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
    </p><p>
      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
      identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
      are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
      make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
      parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
      if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
      titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
      combined work.
    </p><p>
      In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      &#8220;History&#8221; in the various original documents, forming one
      section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;; likewise combine any sections
      Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any sections Entitled
      &#8220;Dedications&#8221;. You must delete all sections Entitled
      &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.
    </p><h3><a name="section6"></a>
      6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    </h3><p>
      You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
      released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
      License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
      the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
      verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    </p><p>
      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
      it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
      License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
      respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    </p><h3><a name="section7"></a>
      7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    </h3><p>
      A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
      independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
      distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright
      resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
      the compilation&#8217;s users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.
    </p><p>
      If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
      of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
      aggregate, the Document&#8217;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
      bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
      covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
      on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
    </p><h3><a name="section8"></a>
      8. TRANSLATION
    </h3><p>
      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
      translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
      Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
      their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
      Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
      Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
      license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
      that you also include the original English version of this License and the
      original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
      disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
      License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
    </p><p>
      If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
      &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement
      (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
      changing the actual title.
    </p><h3><a name="section9"></a>
      9. TERMINATION
    </h3><p>
      You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
      expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
      modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
      terminate your rights under this License.
    </p><p>
      However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
      from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
      and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
      license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
      of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
      cessation.
    </p><p>
      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
      permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
      reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
      violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
      you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
    </p><p>
      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
      licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
      License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
      reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
      give you any rights to use it.
    </p><h3><a name="section10"></a>
      10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    </h3><p>
      The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
      Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
      similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
      address new problems or concerns. See
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">Copyleft</a>.
    </p><p>
      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
      the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
      &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of
      following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
      any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
      Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
      this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
      by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
      can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
      proxy&#8217;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
      authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
    </p><h3><a name="section11"></a>
      11. RELICENSING
    </h3><p>
      &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&#8221; (or &#8220;MMC
      Site&#8221;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable
      works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
      works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a
      server. A &#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&#8221; (or
      &#8220;MMC&#8221;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable
      works thus published on the MMC site.
    </p><p>
      &#8220;CC-BY-SA&#8221; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
      3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
      corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
      California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
      by that same organization.
    </p><p>
      &#8220;Incorporate&#8221; means to publish or republish a Document, in
      whole or in part, as part of another Document.
    </p><p>
      An MMC is &#8220;eligible for relicensing&#8221; if it is licensed under
      this License, and if all works that were first published under this
      License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in
      whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
      sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
    </p><p>
      The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
      under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
      provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

      ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    </h3><p>
      To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
      License in the document and put the following copyright and license
      notices just after the title page:
    </p><pre class="screen">Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME
  
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
  terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
  Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in
  the section entitled &#8220;GNU Free Documentation License&#8221;.</pre><p>
      If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
      replace the &#8220;with&#8230; Texts.&#8221; line with this:

      If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.
    </p><p>
      If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
      use in free software.
