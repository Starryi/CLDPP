This document will help you to de-compile the Java class programs. This
documents gives a list of decompilers which can reverse engineer the Java class
files and generate the Java source code files. Thie is very helpful if you do
not have the Java source code file and have only the Java class files. The
information in this document applies to all the operating sytems where Java
language/Java VM runs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

(The latest version of this document is at http://
www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com. You may want to check there for changes).
Java compiler compiles the Java source code files (*.java) into binaries files
(*.class). You would use the Java de-compiler to convert java class files into
source code files (*.java).
Java de-compiler is very useful especially if you have *.class files and you do
not have access to the source code. Some vendors do not ship the source code
for java class files, in which case you use the java decompiler to look at the
source code.
See also the "javap" command from Sun Microsystems. This command is available
as soon as you install the JDK from Sun Microsystems. At unix prompt type -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  bash$ javap -help
  bash$ javap -c  <filename>.class

2. How can I trust Java Decompiler ??!!

For 100% assurance you need a SCIENTIFIC way to validate and trust the Java
Decompiler program. The method described in this section will enable the
decompiler program to be accepted as "trust-worthy" and reliable.
In order to verify that the decompiler program is regenerating the Java source-
code properly, use the following technique -
Generate the class file from the generated source code using the compiler -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  bash$ mv myprogram.class myprogram_orig.class
  bash$ javac myprogram.java

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now use the unix 'diff' command to compare the two class files -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  bash$ diff myprogram.class myprogram_orig.class

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both these files MUST BE IDENTICAL. This verifies that decompiler program is
working perfectly. On DOS or Windows 95 you may want to use the free Cygnus
Cygwin 'diff' or 'MKS' utilities.
This step gives 100% guarantee and 100% quality assurance and life term or long
term WARRANTY on decompiler programs.
It is strongly recommended that you do these steps every time you run
decompiler programs.

  www.linuxdoc.org/mirrors.html select a site and go to directory /LDP/HOWTO/
  xxxxx-HOWTO.html


* You can get this HOWTO document as a single file tar ball in HTML, DVI,
  Postscript or SGML formats from - ftp://www.linuxdoc.org/pub/Linux/docs/
  HOWTO/other-formats/ and http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto
* Plain text format is in: ftp://www.linuxdoc.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO and
  http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto
* Single HTML file format is in: http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto
  Single HTML file can be created with command (see man sgml2html) - sgml2html
  -split 0 xxxxhowto.sgml
* Translations to other languages like French, German, Spanish, Chinese,
  Japanese are in ftp://www.linuxdoc.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO and http://
  www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto Any help from you to translate to other
  languages is welcome.

The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can be got from
- http://www.sgmltools.org Compiling the source you will get the following
commands like

* sgml2html xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate html file)
* sgml2html -split 0 xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate a single page html file)
* sgml2rtf xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate RTF file)
* sgml2latex xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate latex file)


 4.1 Acrobat PDF format

PDF file can be generated from postscript file using either acrobat distill or
Ghostscript. And postscript file is generated from DVI which in turn is
generated from LaTex file. You can download distill software from http://
www.adobe.com. Given below is a sample session:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  bash$ man sgml2latex
  bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
  bash$ man dvips
  bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
  bash$ distill filename.ps
  bash$ man ghostscript
  bash$ man ps2pdf
  bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
  bash$ acroread output.pdf &

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or you can use Ghostscript command ps2pdf. ps2pdf is a work-alike for nearly
all the functionality of Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product: it converts
PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files. ps2pdf is implemented
as a very small command script (batch file) that invokes Ghostscript, selecting
a special "output device" called pdfwrite. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite
device must be included in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled; see the
documentation on building Ghostscript for details.

 4.2 Convert Linuxdoc to Docbook format

This document is written in linuxdoc SGML format. The Docbook SGML format
supercedes the linuxdoc format and has lot more features than linuxdoc. The
linuxdoc is very simple and is easy to use. To convert linuxdoc SGML file to
Docbook SGML use the program ld2db.sh and some perl scripts. The ld2db output
is not 100% clean and you need to use the clean_ld2db.pl perl script. You may
need to manually correct few lines in the document.

* Download ld2db program from http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rrt/docbook.html or
  from Milkyway_Galaxy_site
* Download the cleanup_ld2db.pl perl script from from Milkyway_Galaxy_site

The ld2db.sh is not 100% clean, you will get lots of errors when you run
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          bash$ ld2db.sh file-linuxdoc.sgml db.sgml
          bash$ cleanup.pl db.sgml > db_clean.sgml
          bash$ gvim db_clean.sgml
          bash$ docbook2html db.sgml

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And you may have to manually edit some of the minor errors after running the
perl script. For e.g. you may need to put closing tag < /Para> for each <
Listitem>

 4.3 Convert to MS WinHelp format

You can convert the SGML howto document to Microsoft Windows Help file, first
convert the sgml to html using:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          bash$ sgml2html xxxxhowto.sgml     (to generate html file)
          bash$ sgml2html -split 0   xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate a single page
  html file)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then use the tool HtmlToHlp. You can also use sgml2rtf and then use the RTF
files for generating winhelp files.

 4.4 Reading various formats

In order to view the document in dvi format, use the xdvi program. The xdvi
program is located in tetex-xdvi*.rpm package in Redhat Linux which can be
located through ControlPanel | Applications | Publishing | TeX menu buttons. To
read dvi document give the command -


               xdvi -geometry 80x90 howto.dvi
               man xdvi


And resize the window with mouse. To navigate use Arrow keys, Page Up, Page
Down keys, also you can use 'f', 'd', 'u', 'c', 'l', 'r', 'p', 'n' letter keys
to move up, down, center, next page, previous page etc. To turn off expert menu
press 'x'.
You can read postscript file using the program 'gv' (ghostview) or
'ghostscript'. The ghostscript program is in ghostscript*.rpm package and gv
program is in gv*.rpm package in Redhat Linux which can be located through
ControlPanel | Applications | Graphics menu buttons. The gv program is much
more user friendly than ghostscript. Also ghostscript and gv are available on
other platforms like OS/2, Windows 95 and NT, you view this document even on
those platforms.

* Get ghostscript for Windows 95, OS/2, and for all OSes from http://
  www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost

To read postscript document give the command -


                       gv howto.ps
                       ghostscript howto.ps


You can read HTML format document using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet
explorer, Redhat Baron Web browser or any of the 10 other web browsers.
You can read the latex, LyX output using LyX a X-Windows front end to latex.
