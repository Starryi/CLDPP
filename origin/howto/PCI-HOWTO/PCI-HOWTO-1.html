<P>Many people, including me, would like to run Linux on a PCI-based machine.
Since it is not obvious which PCI motherboards and PCI cards will work
with Linux and which do not, I conducted a survey and spent some hours
to compile the information contained herein. Most of this was done before 1997
and more uptodate technology might be covered in the device specific howtos
such as the XFree86, Xinerama, Networking and Hardware-HOWTO. </P>
<P>If you have information to add, please mail me. If you have
questions, feel free to ask. </P>
<P>Help with my style/grammar/language is welcome as well. I am not a native-
speaker of English and expect to make occasional mistakes.</P>
<P>Note: "on-board chip" refers to a SCSI chip 
integrated onto the motherboard rather than on a PCI expansion card.</P>
<P>Also, "quotes" herein may have slight context editing.</P>
