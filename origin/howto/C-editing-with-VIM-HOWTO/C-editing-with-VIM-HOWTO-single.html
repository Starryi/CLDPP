	 The purpose of this document is to introduce the novice VIM
	 user to the editing options available in VIM for C files. The
	 document introduces some commands and keystrokes which will
	 help in improving the productivity of programmers using VIM
	 to edit C files.
      </P
><P
> 
	 The scope of the document is to describe how one can edit C
	 files with VIM. However most of what is described is also
	 applicable for vi. Plus what is mentioned here about editing
	 C files is more or less applicable to C++, Java and other similar
	 languages.

	    take you to the opening { of the bar() function. The

CLASS="KEYCAP"

	    The way to remember the keystrokes is by breaking them

CLASS="KEYCAP"

	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"

	    indicates the type of brace to match. If it same same as

	    the keystroke is different then the cursor will move to
	    }.

	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"

	    that they match the braces which are in the
	    <EM

	    all braces upwards and downwards regardless of whether its
	    in the first column or not is not possible. The VIM
	    documentation has a workaround. One has to map the
	    keystrokes to find the braces. Without spending too much

	 </P
><P
>	    VIM allows you to set more than one mark. These marks are
	    stored in registers a-z, A-Z and 1-0. To set a mark and
	    store the same in a register say j, all one has to hit is
	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>mj</B
>. To go back to the mark one has to hit
	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>'j</B
>.
	 </P
><P
>	    Multiple marks are really useful in going back and fro
	    within a piece of code. Taking the same example, one might
	    want one mark at x++; and another at y=x; and jump between
	    them or to any other place and then jump back.
	 </P
><P
>	    Marks can span across files. To use such marks one has to
	    use upper-case registers i.e. A-Z. Lower-case registers are
	    used only within files and do not span files. That's to
	    say, if you were to set a mark in a file foo.c in register
	    "a" and then move to another file and hit
	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>'a</B
>, 
	    the cursor will not jump back to the previous
	    location. If you want a mark which will take you to a
	    different file then you will need to use an upper-case
	    register. For example, use <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>mA</B
> instead of
	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>ma</B
>. I'll talk about editing multiple
	    files in a later section.

>	 The function A_Very_Long_Function_Name() can be quite
	 exasperating to type over and over again. While still in

	 forwards or backwards. In function, Another_Function() one can 
	 type A_Very... and hit <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>CTRL-P</B
>. The first
	 matching word will be displayed first. In this case it would
	 be A_Very_Long_Variable_Name. To complete it correctly, one can

CLASS="KEYCAP"
>CTRL-P</B

	 upwards to the next matching word, which is

	 you can continue typing. VIM remains in insert-mode during
	 the entire process.

CLASS="KEYCAP"

	 sub-mode of the insert mode. So you can enter this mode when
	 you are in the insert-mode. To leave CTRL-X mode you can 
	 hit any keystroke other than CTRL-X, CTRL-P and CTRL-N. Once
	 you leave CTRL-X mode you return to insert-mode.

>	 CTRL-X mode allows you do auto-completion in a variety of
