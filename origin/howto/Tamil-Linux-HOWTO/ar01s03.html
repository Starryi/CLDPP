There are an unknown number of fonts, each
    encoded with their own tables, driven by arbitrary keyboard
    layouts and outputs. In my opinion, Tamil can seriously compete
    with any other language for maximum number of font tables.
    Added to this commotion are the dynamic fonts for the web
    pages, that enable anyone to get away with a non-standard font
    as long as his pages are viewable.</p><p>Adding to all these is the official Indian Standard Code
    for Information Interchange (ISCII), the Government of India
    sponsored <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unifying</span>&#8221;</span> 
    scheme to bring all Indian fonts under the Devanagari umbrella.
    Anyone familiar with the way the characters are written in
    Tamil and in Devanagari script will understand the lack of any
    rationale in this approach.</p><p>Needless to say, this is serving to only add to the
    confusion. A good analysis of this and the unicode for Tamil is
    once again written by Sivaraj and can be found at 
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tamil.net/people/sivaraj/tamil_unicode.html" target="_top">

    introduction written by Sivaraj is at 
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tamil.net/people/sivaraj/write-tamil.html" target="_top">
    </a>.</p><p>Let us ignore the anarchy for a moment and get a picture
    of the frequently used font encodings. There are two main
    contenders and luckily they will converge soon. The first and
    most popular one is the Tamil Standard Code for Information
    Interchange (TSCII), developed by volunteers throughout the world,
    and the other, TAmil Monolingual (TAM), and TAmil Bilingual
    (TAB) encodings, were proposed by the Tamil Nadu Government. Once
    again, TAM is of limited use in an OS environment and we can
    safely ignore that. Almost all Linux efforts are in TSCII
    (Console, KDE, GNOME localizations).</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm72"></a>3.1. TSCII</h3></div></div></div><p>TSCII is a glyph-based, 8-bit bilingual encoding. It
      uses a unique set of glyphs; the usual lower ASCII set.
      Roman letters with standard punctuation marks occupy the
      first 128 slots and the Tamil glyphs occupy the 
      <span class="emphasis"><em>upper ASCII</em></span> 
      segment (slots 128-256). A good overview of the early font
      encoding schemes and a the rationale behind the TSCII
      approach can be found at

      This site discusses the TSCII
      encoding and provides tools including fonts, keyboard
      drivers, editors and inter-conversion tools for various
      platforms. The font encoding table according to TSCII-1.6 can be
      found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tamil.net/tscii/charset16.gif" target="_top">http://www.tamil.net/tscii/charset16.gif</a>.
      </p><p>The current version of TSCII is 1.6, and a revision is
      expected anytime now that will fix some anomalies in using
      various slots for encoding. This version 1.7 will be fully
      backward compatible with 1.6 and is expected to gain
      popularity. The <a class="ulink" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tscii" target="_top">
      TSCII discussion group</a> currently brainstorms on
      modifications to TSCII-1.6. You may be able to participate in
      the discussions by becoming a member. You may also be
      able to download various beta tools from there. The font encoding
