>1.2.1. Private Key/Public Key:</A
></H3
><P
>The encryption using a private key/public key pair ensures that the data can be encrypted by one key but can only be decrypted by the other key pair. This is sometime hard to understand, but believe me it works. The keys are similar in nature and can be used alternatively: what one key encrypts, the other key pair can decrypt. The key pair is based on prime numbers and their length in terms of bits ensures the difficulty of being able to decrypt the message without the key pairs. The trick in a key pair is to keep one key secret (the private key) and to distribute the other key (the public key) to everybody. Anybody can send you an encrypted message, that only you will be able to decrypt. You are the only one to have the other key pair, right? In the opposite , you can certify that a message is only coming from you, because you have encrypted it with you private key, and only the associated public key will decrypt it correctly. Beware, in this case the message is not secured you have only signed it. Everybody has the public key, remember!</P
><P
>The problem left is to know the public key of your correspondent. Usually you will ask him to send you a non confidential signed message that will contains his publick key as well as a certificate.</P

>How do you know that you are dealing with the right person or rather the right web site. Well, someone has taken great length (if they are serious) to ensure that the web site owners are who they claim to be. This someone, you have to implicitly trust: you have his/her certificate loaded in your browser (a root Certificate). A certificate, contains information about the owner of the certificate, like e-mail address, owner's name, certificate usage, duration of validity, resource location or Distinguished Name (DN) which includes the Common Name (CN) (web site address or e-mail address depending of the usage) and the certificate ID of the person who certifies (signs) this information. It contains also the public key and finally a hash to ensure that the certificate has not been tampered with. As you made the choice to trust the person who signs this certificate, therefore you also trust this certificate. This is a certificate trust tree or certificate path. Usually your browser or application has already loaded the root certificate of well known Certification Authorities (CA) or root CA Certificates. The CA maintains a list of all signed certificates as well as a list of revoked certificates. A certificate is insecure until it is signed, as only a signed certificate cannot be modified. You can sign a certificate using itself, it is called a self signed certificate. All root CA certificates are self signed.</P

>1.2.3. The Symmetric key:</A
></H3
><P
>Well, Private Key/Public Key encryption algorithms are great, but they are not usually practical. It is asymmetric because you need the other key pair to decrypt. You can't use the same key to encrypt and decrypt. An algorithm using the same key to decrypt and encrypt is deemed to have a symmetric key. A symmetric algorithm is much faster in doing its job than an asymmetric algorithm. But a symmetric key is potentially highly insecure. If the enemy gets hold of the key then you have no more secret information. You must therefore transmit the key to the other party without the enemy getting its hands on it. As you know, nothing is secure on the Internet. The solution is to encapsulate the symmetric key inside a message encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm. You have never transmitted your private key to anybody, then the message encrypted with the public key is secure (relatively secure, nothing is certain except death and taxes). The symmetric key is also chosen randomly, so that if the symmetric secret key is discovered then the next transaction will be totally different.</P

><P
>There are several encryption algorithms available, using symmetric or asymmetric methods, with keys of various lengths. Usually, algorithms cannot be patented, if Henri Poincare had patented his algorithms, then he would have been able to sue Albert Einstein... So algorithms cannot be patented except mainly in USA. OpenSSL is developed in a country where algorithms cannot be patented and where encryption technology is not reserved to state agencies like military and secret services. During the negotiation between browser and web server, the applications will indicate to each other a list of algorithms that can be understood ranked by order of preference. The common preferred algorithm is then chosen. OpenSSL can be compiled with or without certain algorithms, so that it can be used in many countries where restrictions apply. </P

>1.2.5. The Hash:</A
></H3
><P
>A hash is a number given by a hash function from a message. This is a one way function, it means that it is impossible to get the original message knowing the hash. However the hash will drastically change even for the slightest modification in the message. It is therefore extremely difficult to modify a message while keeping its original hash. It is also called a message digest. Hash functions are used in password mechanisms, in certifying that applications are original (MD5 sum), and in general in ensuring that any message has not been tampered with. It seems that the Internet Enginering Task Force (IETF) prefers SHA1 over MD5 for a number of technical reasons (Cf RFC2459 7.1.2 and 7.1.3).</P

>1.2.6. Signing:</A
></H3
><P
>Signing a message, means authentifying that you have yourself assured the authenticity of the message (most of the time it means you are the author, but not neccesarily). The message can be a text message, or someone else's certificate. To sign a message, you create its hash, and then encrypt the hash with your private key, you then add the encrypted hash and your signed certificate with the message. The recipient will recreate the message hash, decrypts the encrypted hash using your well known public key stored in your signed certificate, check that both hash are equals and finally check the certificate. </P
><P
>The other advantage of signing your messages is that you transmit your public key and certificate automatically to all your recipients.</P
><P
>There are usually 2 ways to sign, encapsulating the text message inside the signature (with delimiters), or encoding the message altogether with the signature. This later form is a very simple encryption form as any software can decrypt it if it can read the embedded public key. The advantage of the first form is that the message is human readable allowing any non complaint client to pass the message as is for the user to read, while the second form does not even allow to read part of the message if it has been tampered with.</P

>The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the software management system and database system that allows to sign certifcate, keep a list of revoked certificates, distribute public key,... You can usually access it via a website and/or ldap server. There will be also some people checking that you are who you are... For securing individual applications, you can use any well known commercial PKI as their root CA certificate is most likely to be inside your browser/application. The problem is for securing e-mail, either you get a generic type certificate for your e-mail or you must pay about USD100 a year per certificate/e-mail address. There is also no way to find someone's public key if you have never received a prior e-mail with his certificate (including his public key).</P

>If SSL was developed for web servers, it can be used to encrypt any protocol. Any protocol can be encapsulated inside SSL. This is used in IMAPS, POPS, SMTPS,... These secure protocols will use a different port than their insecure version. SSL can also be used to encrypt any transaction: there is no need to be in direct (live) contact with the recipient. S/Mime is such protocol, it encapsulates an encrypted message inside a standard e-mail. The message is encrypted using the public key of the recipient. If you are not online with the recipient then you must know its public key. Either you get it from its web site, from a repository, or you request the recipient to e-mail you its public key and certificate (to ensure you are speaking to the right recipient).</P

>In a reverse order, the browser can send its own signed certificate to the web server, as a mean of authentication. But everybody can get the browser certificate on the CA web site. Yes, but the signed certificate has been sent encrypted with the private key, that only the public key can decrypt.</P

>IPSec is a new protocol that sits on top of IP that provides ad-hoc encrypted links between 2 hosts on the Internet. The IPSec implementation is mandatory for IPv6 and can be added to IPv4. If IPSec is part of IPv6, it does not mean that it is deployed by network managers. IPSec is not simple to implement due to the difficulty of having mechanisms to exchange keys automatically between machines. DNS can help, but it is not mainstream, and well known Certificate Authorities do not yet deliver adequate certification facilities for a wide deployement in the enterprise.</P

>At the moment you have the choice between a commercial PKI or your own PKI. The commercial PKI were created at the beginning to enable secure commerce over the Internet, basically securing HTTP. The pricing of certificates was calculated on a per host basis. The cost is more expensive than for a domain name because of the costs to identify the owner of the certificate (tracability), but also as a percentage into your e-commerce profits. Unfortunately this vision of a host basis has some major limitations. It is still acceptable to have a certificate to secure POP, IMAP, and other protocols, but when you need a certificate for each e-mail box on your network, costs start to skyrocket as well as the administrative burden to register all these certificates to the Certificate Authority and that every year. This problems exists too if you want to use certificates to authenticate clients in client/server applications (Web server, IPsec,..)</P
><P
>Why not have a certificate that can sign other certificates? At the moment the only option is to build your own Certificate Authority as described in this document. This allows flexible management of certificates but is limited to the people in your organisation, because people outside your organisation will have to load your root CA certificate to allow smooth operations.</P

>In these days and age security on personnal computers has become important, such importance that Bill Gates stated that when Microsoft will have to choose between features and security, they will now choose security.</P
><P
>This reflections came from the increasing numbers of rogue people on the Internet. Anybody can send you anything, or trick you in installing anything on your computer. The solution is to identify everybody so when you have a problem you can at least blame someone. This is particulary true in the case of SPAM. It is often difficult to find the originator of an unsolicited e-mail and worse to be able to do something to stop this person. What many people have called for is tracability. If you receive some information which is not traceable through a certificate, you may decide to treat this information differently. This is the same concept as caller ID on telephone network. Certifcates offer this capaility for all applicationson the Internet, e-mails (S/MIME), Commerce transactions (HTTPS), Software install (Code Signing),... Unfortunately certificates are not widely used because they cost a lot if they have to be fully deployed. How many users on Yahoo mail, Hotmail, CA Online, can afford an e-mail certificate? There are some scheme to offer free e-mails certificates, but they can only certify that an e-mail address exists, they can trace back to a human or a body in the real world.</P
><P
>A global PKI is needed. All the protocols and standards exist, not need to reinvent the wheel. The <A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>IETF</A
> has all the mechanice worked out. An LDAP server can store the certificates, a DNS server can reference entry back to certificate stores, HTTP can deliver certificate to applications, S/MIME can secure e-mails,... The problem is now a policy problem or rather a profile problem: select which pieces of this standard should be used to cooperate into a global PKI. Which organisation should provide such service? What level of security/tracability will be achieved?... If one can answer these questions, it will be a step in the right direction and if users buy in, then problem solved...</P

>I will keep updated this chapter as the work of the working group on PKI of the <A
