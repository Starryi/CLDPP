levels lower than commercial state of the art.</p></li></ul></div><p>For best value, look in the <span class="emphasis"><em>middle</em></span> of the
current range of available processors.  On the desktop, in late 2007, that
means a CPU costing perhaps $75 to $200, not the latest and greatest quad
core marvels selling for several times that!</p><p>Why?  Because of the way manufacturers' price-performance curves are
shaped.  The top-of-line system is generally boob bait for corporate
executives and other people with more money than sense.  Chances are the
system design is new and untried &#8212; if you're at the wrong point in the
technology cycle, the chip may even be a pre-production sample, or an early
production stepping with undiscovered bugs like the infamous FDIV problem
in early Pentiums.  You don't need such troubles.  Better to go with a
chip/motherboard combination that's been out for a while and is known good.
It's not like you really need the extra speed, after all.</p><p>Besides, if you buy one of these gold-plated systems, you're only
going to kick yourself three months later when the price plunges by
30%.  Further down the product line there's been more real competition
and the manufacturer's margins are already squeezed.  There's less
room for prices to fall, so you won't watch your new toy lose street
value so fast.  Its price will still drop, but it won't plummet 
sickeningly.</p><p>Again, bear in mind that the cheapest processor you can buy new today
is plenty fast enough for Linux.  So if dropping back a speed level or 
two brings you in under budget, you can do it with no regrets.</p><p>Consider one drive rather than two.  This <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span>
reduce overall system performance somewhat, but the cost saving as a
fraction of total system cost is often substantial.</p><p>Another easy economy measure is looking for repaired or reconditioned
parts with a warranty.  These are often as good as new, and much
cheaper.</p><p>Your display is one of the areas where pinching pennies is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a good idea.  You're going to be looking at that
display for hours on end.  You are going to be using the screen real estate
constantly.  Buy the best quality, largest screen you possibly can &#8212; it
will be worth it.</p><p>Similarly, do not reduce the amount of RAM in your system too far.  A
minimum of 4GB of RAM is helpful in desktop systems today.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4. What To Optimize </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 6. Noise Control and Heat Dissipation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
