standards have created a commodity market with low entry barriers, lots of
competitive pressure, and volume high enough to amortize a
<span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of development on the cheap.</p><p>The result is that this hardware gives you lots of
bang-per-buck, and it's getting both cheaper and better all the time.
Furthermore, margins are thin enough that vendors have to be lean,
hungry, and <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> responsive to the market to
survive.</p><p>One good general piece of advice is that you should avoid 
the highest-end new-technology systems (those not yet shipping in
volume). The problem with the high end is that it usually
carries a hefty <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">prestige</span>&#8221;</span> price premium, and may be a bit less
reliable on average because the technology hasn't been through a lot
of test/improve cycles.</p><p>There used to be a real issue with low-end PCs as well,
because there used to be a lot of dodgy crap PC components out
there going into boxes made by vendors trying to save a few cents.
That's not really a problem anymore.  Market pressure has been 
very effective at raising reliability standards for even low-end 
components as the market has matured.  It's actually hard to go
wrong even buying at the bottom end of the market these days.</p><p>I put together the first version of this guide around 1992;
Unix-capable systems are now ten to twenty times cheaper than they were
then.  At today's prices, building your own system from parts no
longer makes much sense at all &#8212;so this HOWTO is now more oriented
towards helping you configure a whole system from a single vendor.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1. Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Buying the Basics</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
