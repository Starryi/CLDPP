information you need to be a savvy buyer of Intel hardware for running
Unix.  It is aimed especially at hackers and others with the technical
skills and confidence to go to the Internet/mail-order channel, but
contains plenty of useful advice for people buying store-front
retail.</p><p>This document is maintained and periodically updated as a service to
the net by Eric S. Raymond, who began it for the very best self-interested
reason that he was in the market and didn't believe in plonking down
several grand without doing his homework first (no, I don't get paid for
this, though I have had a bunch of free software and hardware dumped on me
as a result of it!).  Corrections, updates, and all pertinent information
are welcomed at <a class="ulink" href="mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com" target="_top">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</a>.  The
editorial «we&#8217; reflects the generous contributions of many
savvy Internetters.</p><p>If you email me questions that address gaps in the FAQ material,
you will probably get a reply that says <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Sorry, everything I know
about this topic is in the HOWTO</span>&#8221;</span>.  If you find out the
<span class="emphasis"><em>answer</em></span> to such a question, please share it with
me for the HOWTO, so everyone can benefit.</p><p>If you end up buying something based on information from this HOWTO,
please do yourself and the net a favor; make a point of telling the vendor
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">The HOWTO sent me</span>&#8221;</span> or some equivalent.  If we can show
vendors that this HOWTO influences a lot of purchasing decisions, we get
leverage to change some things that need changing.</p><p>Note that in December 1996 I published an introductory article on
building and tuning Linux systems summarizing much of the material in this
HOWTO.  It's <a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/lj-howtobuild.html" target="_top">available
here</a>.  In 2001 I published an article on building the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr//writings/ultimate-linux-box/" target="_top">Ultimate Linux
Box</a>.</p><p>This Buyer's Guide actually dates back to 1992, when it was known as
the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">PC-Clone Unix Hardware Buyer's Guide</span>&#8221;</span>; this was before Linux
took over my world :-).  Before that, portions of it were part of 
a Unix Buyer's Guide that I maintained back in the 1980s on USENET.</p><p>It may be a matter of historical interest that the page count of this
guide peaked in mid-2001 and has been declining since.  Video, sound, and
other functions are migrating onto motherboards.  Several bus types have
disappeared, as have all the old-school backup technologies that couldn't
scale up to match disk capacities, Spec sheets are getting
simpler. Accordingly, there are parts that used to have whole sections to
hemselves that I barely even write about anymore &#8212; mice, floppy disks,
CD-ROM drives, and keyboards, for example, are utterly generic now,</p><p>Another consequence of the technology stabilizing is also that I'm 
updating this guide less often than I used to.  Years can now go by without
the PC market changing in any fundamental way. </p><p>In retrospect, the success of the ATX standard for motherboards in
1998-1999 was probably the turning point. The PC industry has become
sufficiently commoditized that your choices are now getting simpler rather
than more complicated.  This is a Good Thing.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="newversions"></a>1.2. New versions of this document</h3></div></div></div><p>New versions of the Unix Hardware Buyer HOWTO will be periodically be
