waste heat and acoustic noise of operation.  This may seem like a boring
subject, but cooling is a centrally important one if you want your machine
to last &#8212; because thermal stress from the electronics' own waste heat
is almost certainly what will kill it.  You want that fatal moment to
happen later rather than sooner.  On the other hand, cooling makes acoustic
noise, which human beings don't tolerate well.</p><p>This tradeoff bites harder than you think; it's the fundamental
reason that, despite my money-is-no-object premise in the Ultimate Linux
Box artcles, I didn't go to relatively exotic technologies like
liquid-cooled overclocking or RAID disk arrays for a performance boost.
Sure, they may initially look attractive &#8212; but overclocked chips and
banks of disk drives require massive cooling with lots of moving parts, and
it's not good to be trying to do creative work like programming with
anything that sounds quite so much like an idling jet engine sitting beside
one's desk.</p><p>In 2001 we had already reached the point at which the thermal load
vs. cooling-noise tradeoff is the effective limiting factor in the
performance of personal machines.  Ten years ago, even low-end and medium
"server" machines differed from personal-PC designs in fairly important
ways (different processor and bus types, different speed ranges, etc.)
Nowadays specialized server architectures are in retreat at the high end of
the market and everything else looks like a PC.  And the difference between
a "PC" and a "server" is mainly that servers live in server rooms, and are
allowed to have monster cases with lots of noisy fans.</p><p>So how do we manage this tradeoff for a personal, desktop or
desk-side machine?  Careful choice of components and being willing to pay
some price premium for cool-running and low-noise characteristics can help
a lot.  Even exceptionally clueful system integrators can't generally
afford to do this, because they're under constant competitive pressure to
cut price and costs by using generic components.</p><p>Reducing expected noise and heat in a design call for different
strategies.  It's relatively easy to find decibel figures for the
noisemaking parts in a PC design.  And, once you know a little basic
audiometry and a few basic rules of thumb, it's not hard to form a fair
estimate of your design's noisiness.  Estimating a design's heat
dissipation is harder, partly because the waste-heat emission of a PC's
subsystems tends to vary in a more complex way than the acoustic emissions
of the mechanical parts.  This means that you can and should try to design
ahead for low noise, but on the other hand expect to have to monitor for
heat-dissipation problems in your prototype and solve them by building
in more cooling.</p><p>Here's the basic audiometry you need to know to control your
design's noise emissions:</p><p>Sound is measured in <em class="firstterm">decibels</em>, abbreviated dB,
relative to the threshold of audibility, "A".  (Thus, sound levels above
that threshold are written "dBA".)  The scale is logarithmic, with every
3dB increment roughly doubling sound intensity.</p><p>For sounds that are not phase-related, decibel levels add as a 
logarithmic sum.  Thus if X and Y are uncorrelated sound sources,</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
dBA(X + Y) = 10 * log(10 ^ (dBA(X)/10) + 10 ^ (dBA(Y)/10))<br>
</p></div><p>A consequence of the above formula is that dBA(X + Y) cannot be
more than 3dB above the greater of dBA(X) and dBA(Y) for uncorrelated
sources (6dB for perfectly correlated ones).</p><p>Sound from a point source decays by an inverse-square law,
roughly 6dB for each doubling of distance.</p><p>Important thresholds on the decibel scale:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">0   dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Threshold of hearing</p></dd><dt><span class="term">20  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Rustling leaves, quiet living room</p></dd><dt><span class="term">30  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Quiet office</p></dd><dt><span class="term">40  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Quiet conversation</p></dd><dt><span class="term">45  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Threshold of distraction, according to EPA</p></dd><dt><span class="term">50  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Quiet street, average office noise</p></dd><dt><span class="term">60  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Normal conversation (1 foot distance)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">70  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Inside car</p></dd><dt><span class="term">75  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Loud singing (3 feet)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">80  dBA</span></dt><dd><p>Typical home-stereo listening level</p></dd></dl></div><p>The acoustic noise emitted by PCs is normally a combination of white
noise produced by airflow, high-frequency noise produced by bearing
friction in drive spindles and fans, and the constant frequency "blade
passing" noise that all propellers emit (the latter is often more intense
than white noise and bearing whine).</p><p>The best low-noise ball-bearing case fans emit around 20dBA.
Typical sleeve-bearing fans emit 30-50dBA.</p><p>According to the indispensable <a class="ulink" href="http://tomshardware.com/" target="_top">Tom's Hardware site</a>, you can expect
to cut at least 5dB off the interior noise level of the computer with a
good choice of case.  We'll improve on that by adding sound-absorbing 
material to the interior.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5. But What If I'm Economizing? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7. Special Considerations When Buying Laptops and Netbboks</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
