A netbook is just a
small, low-priced, low-power laptop with relatively small solid-state
drives. Because the display and drive capacity are small, netbooks are
basically just good for email and surfing.  If you're going to do coding
or even much word processing you'll need something more like a traditional
laptop or desktop.</p><p>Up until about 1999 the laptop market was completely crazy.  The
technology was in a state of violent flux, with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">standards</span>&#8221;</span>
phasing in and out and prices dropping like rocks.  Things are beginning to
settle out a bit more now.</p><p>One sign of this change is that there are now a couple of laptop lines
that are clear best-of-breeds for reasons having as much to do with 
good industrial design and ergonomics as the technical details of the
processor and display.</p><p>In lightweight machines, I was a big fan of the Sony VAIO line.
I owned one from early 1999 until it physically disintegrated under
the rigors of travel in late 2000, and could hardly imagine
switching.  They weigh 3.5 pounds, give you an honest 3 hours of life
per detachable battery pack, have a very nice 1024x768 display, and
are just plain <span class="emphasis"><em>pretty</em></span>. Their only serious
drawback is that they're not rugged, and often fall apart after
a year or so of use.</p><p>If you want a full-power laptop that can compete with or replace your
desktop machine, the Lenovo (formerly IBM) ThinkPad line is the bomb.
Capable, rugged, and nicely designed.  I now use a ThinkPad X61, the
lightest and smallest machine in the line, and like it a lot.</p><p>These machines are not cheap, though.  If you're trying to save
money by buying a no-name laptop, here are things to look for:</p><p>First: despite what you may believe, the most important aspect
of any laptop is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the CPU, or the disk, or the
memory, or the screen, or the battery capacity.  It's the keyboard
feel, since unlike in a PC, you cannot throw the keyboard away and
replace it with another one unless you replace the whole computer.
<span class="emphasis"><em>Never buy any laptop that you have not typed on for a couple
hours</em></span>.  Trying a keyboard for a few minutes is not enough.
Keyboards have very subtle properties that can still affect whether
they mess up your wrists.</p><p>A standard desktop keyboard has keycaps 19mm across with 7.55mm
between them.  If you plot frequency of typing errors against keycap size,
it turns out there's a sharp knee in the curve at 17.8 millimeters.  Beware
of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">kneetop</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">palmtop</span>&#8221;</span> machines, which
squeeze the keycaps a lot tighter and typically don't have enough oomph for
Unix anyway; you're best off with the "notebook" class machines that have
full-sized keys.</p><p>Second: with present flatscreens, 1920x1200 color is the best you're
going to do (and that is on a 17in widescreen, which translates to a large
notebook.  On normal size notebooks, a maximum of 1440x900 is more common).
On travel machines like the Lenovo X serties, you're still stuck with
1024x768.  If you want more than that (for X, for example) you have to
either fall back to a desktop or make sure there's an external-monitor port
on the laptop (and many laptops won't support higher resolution than the
flatscreen's).</p><p>Third: about those vendor-supplied time-between-recharge
figures; <span class="emphasis"><em>don't believe them</em></span>.  They collect those
from a totally quiescent machine, sometimes with the screen or hard
disk turned off.  Under Windows, you'd be lucky to get half the endurance
they quote; under Unix, which hits the disk more often, it may be less
yet.  Figures from magazine reviews are more reliable.</p><p>Fourth: You can now avoid many of the driver hassles involved in
getting some devices on your notebook to work (or week well) under Linux by
purchasing a notebook with Linux pre-installed.  Dell has recently started
to make noise in this regard in the Linux community.  Taking this approach
limits the set of notebooks you can consider, but the one you get is likely
to "just work" (including sound, useful capabilities like suspend/resume,
and even hotplugging of external displays and projectors) to a much higher
degree under Linux than others.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">6. Noise Control and Heat Dissipation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 8. How to Buy</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
