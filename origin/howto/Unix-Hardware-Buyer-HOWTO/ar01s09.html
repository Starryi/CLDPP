market should include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>72-hour burn-in to avoid that sudden infant death
syndrome.  (Also, try to find out if they do a power-cycling test and
how many repeats they do; this stresses the hardware much more than
steady burn-in.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>30 day money-back guarantee.  Watch out for fine print
that weakens this with a restocking fee or limits it with
exclusions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1 year parts and labor guarantee (some vendors give 2
years).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1 year of 800 number tech support (many vendors give
lifetime support).</p></li></ul></div><p>Additionally, many vendors offer a year of on-site service free.  You
should find out who they contract the service to.  Also be sure the free
service coverage area includes your site; some unscrupulous vendors weasel
their way out with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">some locations pay extra</span>&#8221;</span>, which
translates roughly to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">through the nose if you're further away than
our parking lot</span>&#8221;</span>.</p><p>If you're buying store-front, find out what they'll guarantee beyond
the above.  If the answer is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">nothing</span>&#8221;</span>, go somewhere
else.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="documention"></a>9.2. Documentation</h3></div></div></div><p>Ask your potential suppliers what kind and volume of documentation
they supply with your hardware.  You should get, at minimum,
operations manuals for the motherboard and each card or peripheral;
also an IRQ list.  Skimpiness in this area is a valuable clue that
they may be using no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan, which is not
necessarily a red flag in itself but should prompt you to ask more
questions.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="quality"></a>9.3. A System Quality Checklist</h3></div></div></div><p>There are various cost-cutting tactics a vendor can use which
bring down the system's overall quality.  Here are some good questions
to ask:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>If you're buying a factory-configured system, does it
have FCC certification?  While it's not necessarily the case that a
non-certified system is going to spew a lot of radio-frequency
interference, certification is legally required &#8212; and becoming
more important as clock frequencies climb.  Lack of that sticker may
indicate a fly-by-night vendor, or at least one in danger of being
raided and shut down! (For further discussion, see the section on <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#rfi" title="3.13. Radio Frequency Interference">Radio Frequency Interference</a>
above.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are the internal cable connectors keyed, so they can't
be put in upside down?  This doesn't matter if you'll never, ever
<span class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> need to upgrade or service your system.
Otherwise, it's pretty important; and, vendors who fluff this detail
may be quietly cutting other corners.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">8. How to Buy </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 10. Things to Check when Buying</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
