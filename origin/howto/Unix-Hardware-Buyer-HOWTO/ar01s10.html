A few tips:</p><p>Beware the deadly modifier <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">manufacturer's</span>&#8221;</span> on a warranty;
this means you have to go back to the equipment's original
manufacturer in case of problems and can't get satisfaction from the
mail-order house.  Also, manufacturer's warranties run from the date
<span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> ship; by the time the mail-order house
assembles and ships your system, it may have run out!</p><p>Watch for the equally deadly <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">We do not guarantee
compatibility</span>&#8221;</span>.  This gotcha on a component vendor's ad means you may
not be able to return, say, a video card that fails to work with your
motherboard.</p><p>Another dangerous phrase is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">We reserve the right to substitute
equivalent items</span>&#8221;</span>.  This means that instead of getting the
high-quality name-brand parts advertised in the configuration you just
ordered, you may get those no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan
&#8212; theoretically equivalent according to the spec sheets, but
perhaps more likely to die the day after the warranty expires.
Substitution can be interpreted as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bait and switch</span>&#8221;</span>, so most
vendors are scared of getting called on this.  Very few will hold
their position if you press the matter.</p><p>Another red flag: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Only warranted in supported
environments</span>&#8221;</span>.  This may mean they won't honor a warranty on a
non-Windows system at all, or it may mean they'll insist on installing the Unix
on disk themselves.</p><p>One absolute show-stopper is the phrase <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">All sales are
final</span>&#8221;</span>.  This means you have <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> options if a
part doesn't work.  Avoid any company with this policy.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mail_questions"></a>10.2. Special Questions to Ask Web/Mail-Order
Vendors Before Buying</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Does the vendor have the part or system presently in
stock?  Mail order companies tend to run with very lean inventories;
if they don't have your item in stock, delivery may take longer.
Possibly <span class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> longer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Does the vendor pay for shipping?  What's the delivery
wait?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you need to return your system, is there a
restocking fee? and will the vendor cover the return freight?  Knowing
the restocking fee can be particularly important, as they make keep
you from getting real satisfaction on a bad major part.  Avoid dealing
with anyone who quotes more than a 15% restocking fee &#8212; and it's
a good idea, if possible, to avoid any dealer who charges a restocking
fee at all.</p></li></ul></div><p>Warranties are tricky.  There are companies whose warranties are
invalidated by opening the case.  Some of those companies sell
upgradeable systems, but only authorized service centers can do
upgrades without invalidating the warranty.  Sometimes a system is
purchased with the warranty already invalidated.  There are vendors
who buy minimal systems and upgrade them with cheap RAM and/or disk
drives.  If the vendor is not an authorized service center, the
manufacturer's warranty is invalidated.  The only recourse in case of
a problem is the vendor's warranty.  So beware!</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="payment"></a>10.3. Payment Method</h3></div></div></div><p>It's a good idea to pay with AmEx or Visa or MasterCard; that way you
can stop payment if you get a lemon, and may benefit from a
buyer-protection plan using the credit card company's clout (not all cards
offer buyer-protection plans, and some that do have restrictions which may
be applicable).  However, watch for phrases like <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Credit card
surcharges apply</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">All prices reflect 3% cash
discount</span>&#8221;</span> which mean you're going to get socked extra if you pay by
card.</p><p>Note that many credit-card companies have clauses in their
standard contracts forbidding such surcharges.  You can (and should)
report such practices to your credit-card issuer.  If you already paid
the surcharge, they will usually see to it that it is returned to you.
Credit-card companies will often stop dealing with businesses that
repeat such behavior.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="vendors"></a>10.4. Which Clone Vendors to Talk To</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="pans"></a>10.4.1. Some pans</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Gateway</em></span>: may also be a vendor to avoid.
Apparently their newer machines don't have parity bits in their
memories; memory is tested only on reboot.  This is dubious design
even for Windows, and totally unacceptable for Unix.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm670"></a>10.4.2. Some picks</h4></div></div></div><p>In early August 2001 I designed an `Ultimate Linux Box' with Gary
