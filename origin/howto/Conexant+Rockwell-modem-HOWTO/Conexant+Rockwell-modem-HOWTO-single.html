>&#13;If you've got a Rockwell or Conexant chipset based modem and you can't seem to get the modem to work with Linux, then you've come to the right place. Chances are that you've got a Software modem (also known as a "winmodem") and you'll need a driver to get the modem working under Linux.&#13;</P

NAME="ABOUT"
>1.2. About the howto</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;This HOWTO originally started out as a website about installing Conexant HSF modems under linux, but after several months of being online the number of hits on the website was rapidly growing (100 hits/day at time of writing this HOWTO) and so were the number of requests for information about Rockwell/Conexant modems that were being posted to the linmodem mailing list, usenet and various web based forums. This lead me to decide that the information needed another distribution medium which would be more accessible to users. The result of this was this HOWTO which has expanded to include a far larger range of information then the original website had, in order to cover all the questions being asked on the internet.</P
><P
> At the same time as the increase in demand for information about Rockwell/Conexant modems under linux a number of non-english webpages appeared explaining how to setup the drivers in languages as diverse as Portuguese and Japanese, these webpages often lacked all the current information which was available making it harder for users to get their modems to work. I decided to release this HOWTO under the GNU Free Documentation License, so that native speakers of other language can translate this document into their own language and redistribute it freely, thus ensuring that all users get all the information regardless of what language they speak. If you're interested in making a translation of this HOWTO please contact me.</P
><P
>&#13;The HOWTO assumes a basic knowledge of Linux, you should be familiar with the basics of how to use a console/terminal, how to use common commands like less and be familiar with a text editor.When the howto needs you to type something in at the console, the console prompt will look like this: '<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[user@localhost]$ </SAMP
>'&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Some parts of the howto rely upon a greater knowledge of Linux, but those section will mainly apply if you have a non-standard Linux distribution. &#13;</P

Drivers are available for both types, but the HSF driver is further into development then the HCF driver so is likely to be more advanced for now. Expect the HCF driver to come out of beta sometime mid-year(2002).

>3. Identifying your modem type</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;The first task you will need to do is to identify whether your modem's chipset is HCF or HSF. Unfortunately the traditional way of doing this (by using /proc/pci, lspci or KDE's control center) won't work for us here due to errors in the pci.ids file which can cause a misidentification of the modem. There are three main ways which you can use to identify your modem's chipset:&#13;</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;If you've got your modem working under Windows then you can identify your chipset by downloading and running <A
HREF="http://www.conexant.com/customer/md_driverassistance.html"
TARGET="_top"
><I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Conexant's ListModem Application</I
></A
>. When you run it, the program will give the information we want under "MODEM TYPE".&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;If you've opened your computer up chances are that the modem's chipset will have either the letters "HSF" or "HCF" printed on it.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;You can identify your type of modem from it's device ID and vendor ID, the easiest way get this information is from the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lspci -n</B
> (or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>less /proc/pci</B
> on older Linux distributions) this command tells you all of the Vendor IDs and Devices IDs for all of the PCI cards in your machine. You will be able to identify your modems' IDs as it will have a vendor ID of either 14F1 (Conexant) or 127A (Rockwell). Ignore any information that the lspci command tells you about your modem being a HSF or HCF as it could be wrong.&#13;</P
><P
>The information is often presented in the form VVVV:DDDD where VVVV is the vendor ID and DDDD is the device ID, for instance if it listed 127a:2005 it would mean the that the Vendor ID is 127a and device ID is 2005.</P

><P
>&#13;A HSF driver first appeared out of the blue in mid-2000 when Olitec released unto the world a binary only driver for their Olitec PCI modem for 2.2.14 kernel, it wasn't long before someone realized that the Olitec modem was based on the Rockwell/Conexant HSF Chipset. Inquiries to Olitec revealed that the driver should work with any HSF chipset as there was nothing in the driver that was specific to the Olitec modems. Many people tried to get the driver to work with non-Olitec modem unfortunately without success, however a few months later and after many hours of work by many people trying a variety of tricks to get the driver to work, several people managed to stumble across the solution. It was a simple one line change to file which solved the problem and the world was left with a working HSF driver, at the time it only worked on 2.2.14 Kernels and Olitec had refused to release the source code to let others try to get it to work with other kernels.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;A few months later Olitec released the driver for 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 kernels, this kept the HSF winmodem community satisfied until we came to the day when the 2.4 kernel was released. None of the previous drivers appeared to work with the 2.4 kernel and this caused problems for all those who wanted to upgrade and also for the large number of new users who were using 2.4.* kernel based distributions such as Mandrake 8 and RedHat 7.1. Not a word had been heard out of Olitec since the 2.4 kernel was released, but Conexant had announced that they intended to develop a Linux driver. After many months of waiting for a 2.4.* driver Marc Boucher decided to something about it and wrote a wrapper which allowed an old version of the driver to be used with 2.4.* kernels.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;That's where we are now, Marc's wrapper is still in experimental development stage but it works and many people are using it to connect to the internet under Linux.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;From the history you'll understand why the next section has to be split into two sections one for 2.2.14 - 2.2.18 kernels and one for 2.4.* kernels. If you don't know what kernel version you have you can find out by using the '<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uname -r</B
>' command at the console window before proceeding to the appropriate section of this HOWTO.&#13;</P

This means that the driver thinks that you don't have the appropriate kernel version, if you have a variant of the kernel (such as the one that has non-standard name) then you can still get the driver to work by loading up the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ins_all</TT
> in a text editor and replacing all of the '<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod -m</B
>' commands with '<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod -f -m</B
>'.&#13;</P

This error tends to be caused by the script being unable to find C Shell at the location <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin/csh</TT
>. If you have C Shell installed in a different location then you should create a symbolic link which points to the correct location. If you don't have you'll need to install it.&#13;</P

This is caused by your computer trying to get Plug-and-Play to work with your modem. You can stop it doing this by going to your BIOS and setting an option which tells it not to do that. The settings name varies from BIOS to BIOS but is normally something like PnP OS.&#13;</P

This is often caused by the modem's device number clashing with that of PCMCIA, you can check if this is the case by entering the command,</P
