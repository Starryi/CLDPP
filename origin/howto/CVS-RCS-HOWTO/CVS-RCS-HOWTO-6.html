<P>The following are wrappers around the basic CVS commands. These scripts
give you initial <B>booster-push</B> into the CVS system and are useful 
until you become very familiar with the CVS commands. The scripts 
are written for Korn shell since it is always available 
on all flavors of Unix, but you can translate to bash or 
Perl if needed. You can customize
these scripts to your taste. They are basically CVS commands, but features are
added to make it site specific. For example, the sedit script provides locking
so that users will know someone is editing the file. Of course users can 
directly use the CVS commands to bypass these scripts. These scripts 
demonstrate how CVS can be <B>customized</B> to a great extent.</P>
<P><B>NOTE: </B> <I>The wrapper shell scripts assume the user's 
home directory as the root and check out the tree from CVS to build the 
tree underneath user's home directory.</I></P>
<P><B> TIP: </B> <I>In these shell scripts, every target filename is composed 
of 3 parts - Home directory, sub-directory 
and the filename. The full-path is $HOME/$subdir/$fname
And in CVS the same directory structure is maintained (by 
variable $subdir) therefore in cvs there will be something 
like  $CVSROOT/$subdir/$fname.
In all scripts, these 4 variables $HOME, $CVSROOT, $subdir and $fname
play an important role. For example, sample values can be like
HOME=/home/aldev, subdir=myproject/src, CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot,
and fname=foo.cpp</I></P>
<P>Copy these scripts to /usr/local/bin and this should be in the user's PATH environment.
