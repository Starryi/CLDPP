<H2><A NAME="Intro_CVS"></A> <A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4">Intro to CVS Commands </A></H2>

<P>CVS provides a rich variety of  commands  (cvs_command  in
the  Synopsis),  each  of  which  often  has  a  wealth of
options, to satisfy the many needs of source management in
distributed environments.  However, you don't have to master
every detail to do useful work with CVS; in fact, five
commands  are  sufficient  to  use (and contribute to) the
source repository.
The most commonly used CVS commands are: 
<B>checkout</B>,
<B>update</B>,
<B>add</B>,
<B>remove</B>,
<B>commit</B> and
<B>diff</B>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="checkout"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.1">checkout</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs checkout modules...</B>
A necessary preliminary for most CVS work:  creates
your  private copy of the source for modules (named
collections of source; you can also use a path relative
to the source repository here).  You can work
with this copy  without  interfering  with  others'
work.   At  least  one subdirectory level is always
created.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help checkout
Usage:
  cvs checkout [-ANPRcflnps] [-r rev | -D date] [-d dir]
    [-j rev1] [-j rev2] [-k kopt] modules...
        -A      Reset any sticky tags/date/kopts.
        -N      Don't shorten module paths if -d specified.
        -P      Prune empty directories.
        -R      Process directories recursively.
        -c      "cat" the module database.
        -f      Force a head revision match if tag/date not found.
        -l      Local directory only, not recursive
        -n      Do not run module program (if any).
        -p      Check out files to standard output (avoids stickiness).
        -s      Like -c, but include module status.
        -r rev  Check out revision or tag. (implies -P) (is sticky)
        -D date Check out revisions as of date. (implies -P) (is sticky)
        -d dir  Check out into dir instead of module name.
        -k kopt Use RCS kopt -k option on checkout.
        -j rev  Merge in changes made between current revision and rev.
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)

<H2><A NAME="update"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.2">Staying in sync with other developers - 'cvs update'</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs update</B>
Execute  this  command  from  within  your  private
source  directory  when  you  wish  to  update your
copies of source  files  from  changes  that  other
developers  have  made to the source in the repository.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help update
Usage: cvs update [-APdflRp] [-k kopt] [-r rev|-D date] [-j rev]

In order to receive changes from the latest commits from your peer developers, do: 
bash$ cvs update

bash$ cvs update -d

</P>



<H2><A NAME="add"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.3">add</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs add file...</B>
Use this command to enroll new files in CVS records
of your working directory.  The files will be added
to the  repository  the  next  time  you  run  `cvs
commit'.   Note:  You  should  use the `cvs import'
command to bootstrap new sources  into  the  source
repository.   `cvs  add' is only used for new files
to an already checked-out module.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help add
Usage: cvs add [-k rcs-kflag] [-m message] files...
        -k      Use "rcs-kflag" to add the file with the specified kflag.
        -m      Use "message" for the creation log.
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)  

To add a new file to the repository do: 
bash$ cvs add newFile
bash$ cvs commit

To add a new binary file to the repository do: 
bash$ cvs add -kb newBinaryFile
bash$ cvs commit
(-kb specifies that file is binary) 

To add a new directory to the repository do: 
bash$ cvs add newDirectory
bash$ cvs commit

To remove an existing file from the repository do: 
bash$ rm existingFile
bash$ cvs remove existingFile
bash$ cvs commit
</PRE>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="remove"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.4">remove</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs remove file...</B>
Use this command (after erasing any  files  listed)
to  declare  that  you wish to eliminate files from
the repository.  The removal does not affect others
until you run `cvs commit'.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help remove
Usage: cvs remove [-flR] [files...]
        -f      Delete the file before removing it.
        -l      Process this directory only (not recursive).
        -R      Process directories recursively.
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)

<H2><A NAME="commit"></A> <A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.5">commit</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs commit file...</B>
To check in modifications (on existing files).
Use this command when you wish to ``publish'' your
changes to other developers, by incorporating  them
in the source repository.</P>
<P><B>NOTE : </B> It's usually a very good idea to do 'cvs update' before committing changes.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help commit
Usage: cvs commit [-nRlf] [-m msg | -F logfile] [-r rev] files...
        -n      Do not run the module program (if any).
        -R      Process directories recursively.
        -l      Local directory only (not recursive).
        -f      Force the file to be committed; disables recursion.
        -F file Read the log message from file.
        -m msg  Log message.
        -r rev  Commit to this branch or trunk revision.

<H2><A NAME="diff"></A> <A NAME="ss4.6">4.6</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.6">diff</A>

<H2><A NAME="createrelease"></A> <A NAME="ss4.7">4.7</A> <A HREF="CVS-RCS-HOWTO.html#toc4.7">Creating Releases</A>
</H2>

<P>Since there usually are several files with different version numbers in a project,
it's a good idea to "stamp" the files with a release tag for each release, this can
be done like this (for version "v001"): 
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs tag -R "v001"
bash$ cvs commit

This release can be checked out with 
bash$ cvs checkout -r "v001" YourProject

</H2>

<P>Emacs is a powerful editor and it supports CVS/RCS - especially 
for revision merging and comparing. The main Emacs site
