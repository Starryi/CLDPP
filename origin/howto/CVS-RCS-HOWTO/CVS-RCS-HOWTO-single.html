<EM>This document is a "practical guide" to very quickly setup CVS/RCS source code
control system. This document has custom shell scripts that are wrappers on top of CVS. These scripts provide an easy user interface for CVS. Several shell scripts are provided to make RCS easier to use.
The information in this document applies to Linux and as well as to all other flavors of Unix like Solaris, HPUX, AIX, SCO, Sinix, BSD, SCO, Apple Macintosh (which is BSD unix) etc.. and BeOS.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P><B>(The latest version of this document is at 
<A HREF="http://www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com">http://www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com</A>. 
You may want to check there for changes).</B></P>
<P>A source code control system is a MUST to manage 
the changes occurring to a software project during development. Developers need a complete history of changes
to backtrack to previous versions in case of any problems.
Since source code is the most vital component of any software project and  
software development takes a huge amount of time and money, it is very important to spend some 
time in <I><B>safe-guarding</B></I> the source code by using source code control systems like CVS and RCS.</P>
<P>CVS (Concurrent Version Control System) is a powerful tool which allows 
concurrent development of software by multiple users. It uses RCS 
underneath and has an application layer interface as a wrapper on top of RCS.</P>
<P>CVS can record the history of your files (usually,
but not always, source code). CVS only stores the differences
between versions, instead of every version of every file
you've created. CVS also keeps a log of who, when and
why changes occurred, among other aspects.</P>
<P>CVS is very helpful for managing releases and controlling
the concurrent editing of source files among multiple
authors. Instead of providing version control for a
collection of files in a single directory, CVS provides
version control for a hierarchical collection of
directories consisting of revision controlled files.</P>
<P>These directories and files can then be combined 
to form a software release.</P>
<P>CVS can be used for storing "C", "C++", Java, Perl, HTML and
other files.</P>
<P><B>HISTORY of CVS: </B>
CVS is a very highly sophisticated and complex system. It is the 
<I><B>"State of the Art"</B></I>
technology and is so called <I>"software miracle"</I>. The CVS software is a 
very advanced and capable system developed
over a very long period of time. And it took several years to mature!! It took
about 20 to 30 years of research to develop CVS algorithms and later it was coded 
into a software. And even today, it is still evolving!!</P>
<P>CVS algorithms actually started in Universities several decades ago and
CVS implementation started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by Dick Grune, who 
posted it to the newsgroup comp.sources.unix in the volume 6 release 
of <B>December, 1986</B>. While no actual code from these shell scripts is present in the 
current version of CVS much of the CVS conflict resolution algorithms come from them. 
In April, 1989, Brian Berliner designed and coded CVS. Jeff Polk 
later helped Brian with the design of the CVS module and vendor branch support.</P>
<P>And today each and every major software development project in the world is written
using CVS as the safe repository. As good old software hats say - 
<I>"You are in very safe hands, if you are using CVS !!!"</I></P>



<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Which One Is for Me? CVS or RCS</A></H2>

<P>CVS actually uses RCS underneath. CVS is a lot more powerful tool and
can control a complete source code tree. 
It is <I><B>very strongly</B></I> recommended that you use CVS, because you can greatly customize CVS with scripting languages like PERL, Korn and bash shells. 
See the sample korn shell scripts at 
<A HREF="#Shell Scripts">Shell Scripts</A>
.</P>
<P>Advantages of CVS:
<UL>
<LI> CVS is decentralized so a user checks out files/directories 
from the repository
and have his own separate stable source directory tree.</LI>
<LI> CVS can "STAMP" releases of an entire project source tree.</LI>
<LI> CVS can enable concurrent editing of files.</LI>
<LI> CVS can be greatly customized to enable strong locking of files 
via shell scripts or PERL scripts.
CVS supports weak locking with the command 'cvs watches' and also
no locking permitting concurrent editing of files. </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Disadvantages of CVS:
<UL>
<LI> Needs a little more administration than RCS.</LI>
<LI> Very highly sophisticated and complex system. It is "State of the Art" 
technology. The cvs software is a very advanced and capable system developed
over a very long period of time (it took several years!!). It took about 20 to 30 years
of research to develop CVS and it is still evolving!!</LI>
<LI> Has a large number of commands and command options, hence a steeper 
learning curve for beginners. The shell scripts at 
<A HREF="#Shell Scripts">Shell Scripts</A>
 can ease usage.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Advantages of RCS:
<UL>
<LI> RCS is very simple to setup, with less administrative work.</LI>
<LI> RCS is used in a centralized area where everyone works. </LI>
<LI> RCS is useful for simple systems.</LI>
<LI> Very strong locking of files - concurrency eliminated.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Downside of RCS:
<UL>
<LI> Concurrent development by multiple developers is not possible due to file 
locking and being limited to a single working directory. Because of the 
single working directory limitation, changes to files by multiple developers can 
cause failure of the 'make' command.</LI>
<LI> Cannot stamp releases of an entire software project.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>This document also has 
shell scripts which provide
simple commands to check-out, check-in, and commit files.
See shell scripts at 
<A HREF="#Shell Scripts">Shell Scripts</A>
</P>
<P>For RCS see the RCS mini-howto on the Linux cdrom: 
<HR>
<PRE>
cd /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS
ls -l howto-6.0-*.noarch.rpm
rpm -qpl howto-6* | grep -i rcs 
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="Setting up CVS"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. Setting up CVS </A></H2>

<P>First you need to install the CVS package. On Redhat Linux use:
<HR>
<PRE>
cd /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS
rpm -i rcs*.rpm
rpm -i cvs*.rpm
rpm -i openssh*.rpm
To see the list of files installed do -
rpm -qpl cvs*.rpm | less
</PRE>
<HR>

and browse the output using j,k, CTRL+f, CTRL+D, CTRL+B, CTRL+U or using arrow keys, page up/down keys.
See 'man less'.</P>
<P>The Openssh is required if you want to use ssh (Secure Shell) with CVS.</P>
<P>On other flavors of Unix, you may need to download the RCS and CVS tar balls
and follow the README, INSTALL files to setup CVS.

<H2><A NAME="CVS-Env"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Environment variables </A>
</H2>

<P>The following environment variables need to be setup in /etc/profile - default 
values required for all users.
If not set in /etc/profile, then you should add these to your 
local profile file &nbsp;/.bash_profile.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
export EDITOR=/bin/vi
export CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot

# WARNING!! WARNING: If you set CVSREAD to yes, checkout and update will try hard to 
# make the files in your working directory read-only.  When this is not set,
# the default behavior is to permit modification of your working files.
#export CVSREAD=yes
</PRE>
<HR>

And of course, individual users can <I>override</I> the environment variables 
set in /etc/profile by resetting them in their local profile file &nbsp;/.bash_profile
<HR>
<PRE>
# File ~/.bash_profile
# Overriding env variables by resetting
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/emacs
export CVSROOT=/home/someotherdir/java/cvsroot
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Create a directory to store the source code repository 
and give read, write access to Unix group/user.
Also make sure that the directory name of CVSROOT does not contain
any blank spaces. For example CVSROOT should not be like '/home/my rootcvs'.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ su - root
bash# export CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot
bash# groupadd --help
bash# groupadd cvs
bash# useradd --help
bash# useradd -g cvs -d $CVSROOT cvs
bash# mkdir $CVSROOT

bash# ls -ld $CVSROOT   ... (you should see the listing)
bash# chgrp -R cvs $CVSROOT
bash# chmod o-rwx $CVSROOT
bash# chmod ug+rwx $CVSROOT

# To initialize the CVS repository and to put in source code files
# do (but requires env CVSROOT to be set) :
bash# cvs init

# Add the unix users to the cvs group. Create supplementary groups for users.
# Note that you MUST not put any blank spaces after comma separating the
# group names in -G option.
# In example below user tom belongs to groups cvs, users and staff and user
# johnson belongs to group cvs only.
bash# usermod --help
bash# usermod -G cvs some_unix_username
bash# usermod -G cvs,users,staff tom
bash# usermod -G cvs,users,staroffice billclinton
bash# usermod -G cvs johnson
bash# exit    .... (logout of root superuser mode)

# Login as a user and import files into cvs....
bash$ su - billclinton
bash$ export EDITOR=/bin/vi
bash$ export CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot

# WARNING! WARNING: If you set CVSREAD to yes, checkout and update will try hard to 
# make the files in your working directory read-only.  When this is not set,

bash$ export CVSREAD=yes

# Change directory is a must (MANDATORY)
bash$ cd $HOME/somedir/anotherdir/directory/my_source_code_dir

# Must give vendor tag and revision tag
cvs import somedir/anotherdir/directory/my_source_code_dir vendor_1_0 rev_1_0

# Also note that it is very important to give the directory tree starting
# from the $HOME, that is, in above example starting from somedir.
# For example I did:
bash$ cd $HOME/howto/foobar
bash$ cvs import howto/foobar vendor_1_0 rev_1_0

# Another example is:
bash$ cd $HOME/javafilesdir
bash$ cvs import javafilesdir vendor_1_0 rev_1_0

# A sample testing and verification:
bash$ cd $HOME/howto/foobar
bash$ cvs checkout myfoo.java
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P><B>TROUBLESHOOTING:</B> When doing checkout it says module is unknown. It 
is a common mistake not to change directory while doing cvs import. You 
<B><I>MUST change directory</I></B> to the 
source-code-directory and then do cvs import. For example:
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cd $HOME/somedirectory/foobardir
bash$ cvs import somedirectory/foobardir vendor_1_0 rev_1_0
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="clientbox"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Setup CVS on Client Box</A>
</H2>

<P>On client boxes where you want to use the CVS, you should install
cvs packages and ssh package (if you want to use ssh).
Setup the environment variables:
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ export CVSROOT=":ext:developer@cvs_server_box.domain.com:/home/cvsroot"
bash$ export CVS_RSH="ssh"
</PRE>
<HR>

The cvs_server_box.domain.com is the IP address of the remote CVS repository server
and 'developer' is the user id.
Another example using pserver is given below:
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:username@cvs.tldp.org:/cvsroot
bash$ export CVS_RSH="ssh"
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="RCS2CVS"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Migrate RCS to CVS </A>
</H2>

<P>To migrate the existing RCS files to CVS, use the following script from
<A HREF="#downloadsoftware">downloadsoftware</A>
 
. Make sure that you installed the Korn shell package pdksh*.rpm from the Linux contrib cdrom.</P>
<P><B>NOTE : <I>Get the Korn shell /bin/ksh by installing pdksh*.rpm from the Linux contrib cdrom</I></B></P>
<P>Now the RCS is migrated to CVS as 'project'. You can start using the
CVS commands on module 'project'.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Intro_CVS"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Intro to CVS Commands </A></H2>

<P>CVS provides a rich variety of  commands  (cvs_command  in
the  Synopsis),  each  of  which  often  has  a  wealth of
options, to satisfy the many needs of source management in
distributed environments.  However, you don't have to master
every detail to do useful work with CVS; in fact, five
commands  are  sufficient  to  use (and contribute to) the
source repository.
The most commonly used CVS commands are: 
<B>checkout</B>,
<B>update</B>,
<B>add</B>,
<B>remove</B>,
<B>commit</B> and
<B>diff</B>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="checkout"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 checkout</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs checkout modules...</B>
A necessary preliminary for most CVS work:  creates
your  private copy of the source for modules (named
collections of source; you can also use a path relative
to the source repository here).  You can work
with this copy  without  interfering  with  others'
work.   At  least  one subdirectory level is always
created.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help checkout
Usage:
  cvs checkout [-ANPRcflnps] [-r rev | -D date] [-d dir]
    [-j rev1] [-j rev2] [-k kopt] modules...
        -A      Reset any sticky tags/date/kopts.
        -N      Don't shorten module paths if -d specified.
        -P      Prune empty directories.
        -R      Process directories recursively.
        -c      "cat" the module database.
        -f      Force a head revision match if tag/date not found.
        -l      Local directory only, not recursive
        -n      Do not run module program (if any).
        -p      Check out files to standard output (avoids stickiness).
        -s      Like -c, but include module status.
        -r rev  Check out revision or tag. (implies -P) (is sticky)
        -D date Check out revisions as of date. (implies -P) (is sticky)
        -d dir  Check out into dir instead of module name.
        -k kopt Use RCS kopt -k option on checkout.
        -j rev  Merge in changes made between current revision and rev.
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)

</P>




<H2><A NAME="update"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Staying in sync with other developers - 'cvs update'</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs update</B>
Execute  this  command  from  within  your  private
source  directory  when  you  wish  to  update your
copies of source  files  from  changes  that  other
developers  have  made to the source in the repository.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help update
Usage: cvs update [-APdflRp] [-k kopt] [-r rev|-D date] [-j rev]

        -f      Force a head revision match if tag/date not found.
        -l      Local directory only, no recursion.
        -R      Process directories recursively.
        -p      Send updates to standard output (avoids stickiness).
        -k kopt Use RCS kopt -k option on checkout.
        -r rev  Update using specified revision/tag (is sticky).
        -D date Set date to update from (is sticky).
        -j rev  Merge in changes made between current revision and rev.

</PRE>
<HR>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="add"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 add</A>
</H2>

<P><B>cvs add file...</B>
Use this command to enroll new files in CVS records
of your working directory.  The files will be added
to the  repository  the  next  time  you  run  `cvs
commit'.   Note:  You  should  use the `cvs import'
command to bootstrap new sources  into  the  source
repository.   `cvs  add' is only used for new files
to an already checked-out module.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help add
Usage: cvs add [-k rcs-kflag] [-m message] files...
        -k      Use "rcs-kflag" to add the file with the specified kflag.
        -m      Use "message" for the creation log.
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)  

To add a new file to the repository do: 
bash$ cvs add newFile
bash$ cvs commit

To add a new binary file to the repository do: 
bash$ cvs add -kb newBinaryFile
bash$ cvs commit
(-kb specifies that file is binary) 

To add a new directory to the repository do:

the repository.  The removal does not affect others
until you run `cvs commit'.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help remove
Usage: cvs remove [-flR] [files...]
        -f      Delete the file before removing it.
        -l      Process this directory only (not recursive).

To check in modifications (on existing files).
Use this command when you wish to ``publish'' your
changes to other developers, by incorporating  them
in the source repository.</P>
<P><B>NOTE : </B> It's usually a very good idea to do 'cvs update' before committing changes.
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs --help commit
Usage: cvs commit [-nRlf] [-m msg | -F logfile] [-r rev] files...
        -n      Do not run the module program (if any).

<H2><A NAME="createrelease"></A> <A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 Creating Releases</A>
</H2>

<P>Since there usually are several files with different version numbers in a project,
it's a good idea to "stamp" the files with a release tag for each release, this can
be done like this (for version "v001"): 
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ cvs tag -R "v001"
bash$ cvs commit

This release can be checked out with

<H2><A NAME="locking"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Strong, Weak or No Locking </A></H2>

<P>CVS is a powerful system and is highly customizable. CVS supports:

</UL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="Shell Scripts"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Shell Scripts </A></H2>

<P>The following are wrappers around the basic CVS commands. These scripts
give you initial <B>booster-push</B> into the CVS system and are useful 
until you become very familiar with the CVS commands. The scripts 
are written for Korn shell since it is always available 
on all flavors of Unix, but you can translate to bash or 
Perl if needed. You can customize
these scripts to your taste. They are basically CVS commands, but features are
added to make it site specific. For example, the sedit script provides locking
so that users will know someone is editing the file. Of course users can 
directly use the CVS commands to bypass these scripts. These scripts 
demonstrate how CVS can be <B>customized</B> to a great extent.</P>
<P><B>NOTE: </B> <I>The wrapper shell scripts assume the user's 
home directory as the root and check out the tree from CVS to build the 
tree underneath user's home directory.</I></P>
<P><B> TIP: </B> <I>In these shell scripts, every target filename is composed 
of 3 parts - Home directory, sub-directory 
and the filename. The full-path is $HOME/$subdir/$fname
And in CVS the same directory structure is maintained (by 
variable $subdir) therefore in cvs there will be something 
like  $CVSROOT/$subdir/$fname.
In all scripts, these 4 variables $HOME, $CVSROOT, $subdir and $fname
play an important role. For example, sample values can be like
HOME=/home/aldev, subdir=myproject/src, CVSROOT=/home/cvsroot,
and fname=foo.cpp</I></P>
<P>Copy these scripts to /usr/local/bin and this should be in the user's PATH environment.

<H2><A NAME="cvsexe"></A> <A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Method 1: Using VNC, Samba </A>
</H2>

<P>It is <B>VERY STRONGLY recommended</B> that you use 
<A HREF="http://www.samba.org">Samba(on cdrom samba*.rpm)</A>
and a VNC viewer (or PC X Server) on MS Windows 95/NT. 
With samba the Unix/Linux CVS server will be like a <B>file server</B>.
By using Samba the remote directory on Unix
will look like a local folder on MS Windows on the local disk. 
Install samba*.rpm on Unix/Linux server(which has the CVS repository) and install 
the VNC viewer (or PC X server) on 
MS Windows 95/NT/2000/XP desktop. Using a VNC (or PC X server) you can easily log on to the
Unix box and check-out/check-in the files. And you can use tools like
Java Visual Cafe or Java JBuilder on MS Windows to edit the files located in Unix/Linux
folder(via samba). 
After editing, you can check-in the files to Unix through VNC or PC X-server.</P>
<P>Advantages of using CVS on Linux/Unix via MS Windows are:
<UL>
<LI> Only one single Linux File server (CVS server) can serve many MS Windows clients.</LI>
<LI> A Linux file server (CVS) is very robust, secure and reliable</LI>
<LI> Only one UPS (uninterrupted power supply) battery is required for a linux server.</LI>
<LI> Linux can serve as MS Windows folder through Samba package.</LI>
<LI> A Linux file server (CVS) supports centralized backups via tools like

<P>The best tool for remote access is VNC. The VNC is lightweight and is

<H2><A NAME="multiuser"></A> <A NAME="s11">11. Remote, Multi-User CVS Repository </A></H2>

<P>The Cederqvist manual at 
<A HREF="http://cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_2.html#SEC30">http://cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_2.html#SEC30</A> 
describes how to setup CVS for external access.</P>
<P>In order to use CVS for a group, one has to set up a permissions 
system to allow people to access the system from other machines. 
There are three ways to do this (:server:, :pserver:, and :ext:). 
The pserver mechanism and use of rsh are 
both insecure.  Only the :ext: (with ssh) offers sufficient security 
protection.</P>
<P>If you set CVS_RSH to SSH or some other rsh replacement, 
the instructions <B>may be</B> similar to `.rhosts' but 
consult the documentation for your rsh replacement.</P>
<P>To get ssh visit
<A HREF="http://rpmfind.net">http://rpmfind.net</A> and in the search box enter "ssh".
Or visit 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/apps/download">http://www.redhat.com/apps/download</A> and in the search box enter "ssh".
Download and install the ssh RPM and then configure CVS to use it.  
See also 
<A HREF="http://www.ssh.org">http://www.ssh.org</A>.</P>
<P>Note: If you plan to configure CVS for use with rsh then 
you MUST do this critical step:
<HR>
<PRE>
bash# chmod 600 .rhosts
</PRE>
<HR>

</H2>

<P>If you're tired of entering passwords for each simple CVS command, then 
you can distribute your ssh-identity from the client to the server in order
to allow automatic identification (i.e. no password needed!), this can be done by 
On the CVS server box do:
<HR>

For ssh 1: 
bash$ cd $HOME
bash$ ssh-keygen

For ssh 2:

</P>
<P>You should be asked to save 'your identification' in /home/developer/.ssh/identity
(ssh 1) or /home/developer/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (ssh 2) (or wherever $HOME points to),
just hit enter. When asked for password and confirmation of password, continue
hitting enter. Then copy your public key (identity.pub for ssh 1 or id_rsa.pub for
ssh 2) to the server using secure copy (a part of ssh): </P>
<P>

<P>Version control from this point should not require you to enter the password.</P>
<P>Note: This enables anyone getting access to your client to continue into the server
without knowing the password on the server. </P>
<P>Encrypted Disks</P>
<P>If you fear such a situation, this can (somewhat) be prevented by using a encrypted
disk, e.g. PGPDisk holding the $HOME directory on the client. So when an intruder
takes over your machine s/he needs to know the password for your encrypted disk in
order to get further into the server. Another advantage of using a encrypted disk is
that your (checked out) source code can reside on it.</P>


<H2><A NAME="sshtunnel"></A> <A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Securing CVS by pserver Port Forwarding using an SSH Tunnel </A>
</H2>


<P>From : 
<A HREF="http://www.cycom.co.uk/howto/cvssshtunnel.html">http://www.cycom.co.uk/howto/cvssshtunnel.html</A></P>
<P>The Concurrent Versions System, in its "pserver" client/server mode, and secured by "ssh" encrypted tunnels, can allow multiple authors to safely collaborate over the internet. CVS is a source file version control system optimised for wide area networks, concurrent editing, and reuse of 3rd party source libraries. Pserver is a protocol used for communication between CVS clients and servers. SSH is a tool to transparently encrypt TCP/IP network connections.
MSWindows users can use a posix shell</P>
<P>The tools discussed here are most functional in a unix environment but windows users can obtain similar functions by using a posix shell available from http://www.cygwin.com/. which will include an openssh package in 'latest' and a cvs package in 'contrib'. Other native windows ports of the tools are available but may lack needed features such as SSH2 DSA support.
Creating the CVS Repository on the repository server machine</P>
<P>If you are a contributing author, you don't need to know how the repository was created. You may skip this section.
If you are the unix repository administrator, you would create a directory and run
cvs init
then adjust the control files in CVSROOT to suit the permitted users (writers, passwd). It is convenient to have all files owned by "cvsuser"
Starting the repository service</P>
<P>If you are a contributing author, you don't need to know how the repository server is started. You may skip this section. If you are the unix repository administrator, you allow the server to be started by xinetd with security constraints that specify that only clients local to the server machine may connect. To do this, create a configuration file named "/etc/xinetd.d/cvspserver" with contents similar to:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
service cvspserver
{
        flags           = REUSE
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = cvsuser
        server          = /usr/bin/cvs
        server_args     = -f --allow-root=/cycomcvs pserver
        passenv         =
        log_on_failure  += USERID
        only_from               = 127.0.0.1
        bind                    = 127.0.0.1
}   
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>then restart the xinetd super-service.
Generating a public/private DSA keypair on the author's client machine</P>
<P>Contributing authors must perform this step only once. The "ssh" tools have various ways of authenticating users. The method chosen here is to use the DSA Digital Signature Algorithm. This is a public/private keypair algorithm which means that the secret private key need never be communicated to anyone and can stay safe on the clients hard disk (protected by a passphrase). The public key can be advertised to anyone with no loss of security. If you do not already have the ssh tools then you should obtain them from http://www.openssh.com/. They must support SSH2 as we use the DSA algorithm not RSA.</P>
<P>A unix client will generate the keypair using:-
ssh-keygen -d
This will result in the creation of a file "&nbsp;/.ssh/id_dsa.pub". You must send this public file to the unix repository administrator. Do not send any other file nor reveal any passphrase.
Authorizing a client to tunnel to the repository server machine</P>
<P>If you are a contributing author, you don't need to know how authorization is allowed. You may skip this section.
If you are the unix repository administrator, on receipt of a clients "id_dsa.pub" file, append the single line therein to the "&nbsp;cvsnobody/.ssh/authorized_keys2" file on the server.
Creating the secure tunnel between author's client machine and the repository server machine.</P>
<P>CVS keeps a single copy of the master sources called a source repository. Remote authors access the repository using CVS client programs which talk to the repository service using a "pserver" protocol and connect using a registered TCP/IP port (port 2401).</P>
<P>The pserver protocol is insecure because passwords are transmitted unencrypted and there are often some hacked hosts on a network that are sniffing for passwords. The connection to be used for the pserver protocol therefore needs to be encrypted where it passes over any network. The "ssh" suite of programs provides such encrypted connections.</P>
<P>SSH will create a secure tunnel which makes the repository service appear to be local to your client machine. Similarly, your client machine will appear to be local to the repository service. Both client and server are fooled into thinking that they are on the same machine and that no traffic travels over any network.</P>
<P>The single line unix command to achieve this is:-
/usr/bin/ssh -v -a -e none -N -o 'KeepAlive=yes' -o 'BatchMode=yes' -L 2401:localhost:2401 cvsnobody@j2ee.cycom.co.uk
The fixed cvsnobody user is just for ssh tunneling purposes; it is not relevant to CVS. The j2ee.cycom.co.uk is the repository server machine name. This command will block. To destroy the tunnel, cntrl-c the command. If the tunnel collapses in use, reestablish it by repeating the command. Use another window to operate the CVS clients.
Operating CVS clients on the author's client machine</P>
<P>Having established a tunnel, the remote CVS repository service now appears to be local to your client machine (i.e. at localhost). The CVS client programs obtain configuration data from a CVSROOT environment variable which should be set in unix (e.g in your ".bash_profile") using:-</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
CVSROOT=':pserver:jsharp@localhost:/cycomcvs'
export CVSROOT
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>

<P>The username "jsharp" and the repository root "/cycomcvs" will have been sent to you by the repository administrator.</P>
<P>The first CVS client command should always be:-
cvs login
You will be prompted for a password (again sent to you by the repository administrator).</P>
<P>To create a new cvs working directory and populate it from Honest John Car Rental Demo sources, use :-</P>

<H2><A NAME="configmgt"></A> <A NAME="s15">15. Configuration Management System Tools </A></H2>

<P><B>What is Configuration Management (CM) ?</B></P>
<P>There are a number of different interpretations. 
It is about the tracking and
control of software development and its activities. That is, it concerns the 
management of software development projects with
respect to issues such as multiple developers working on the 
same code at the same time, targeting multiple
platforms, supporting multiple versions, and controlling the 
status of code (for example a beta test versus a real release).
Even within that scope there are different schools of thought:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Traditional Configuration Management - checkin/checkout control 
of sources (and sometimes binaries) and the
ability to perform builds (or compiles) of the entities. Other
functions may be included as well. 
</LI>
<LI>Process Management - control of the software development 
activities. For example, it might check to ensure
that a change request existed and had been approved for fixing
and that the associated design, documentation,
and review activities have been completed before allowing the 
code to be "checked in" again.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>While process management and control are necessary for a
repeatable, optimized development process, a solid
configuration management foundation for that process is essential.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s17">17. SCCS v/s CVS-RCS</A></H2>

<P>SCCS (Source Code Control System) 
is no longer being enhanced or improved. 
The general consensus has been that this tool is clumsy and not
suited to large numbers of users working on one project. 
Actually, SCCS interleaves 
all the versions, but it can make new development get 
<B>progressively slower</B>. Hence, SCCS is NOT recommended for
new projects; however, it is still there to support old code base in SCCS.</P>
<P>RCS (Revision Control System) is often considered to be 
better than SCCS. One reason for this is that RCS baselines the most
recent version and keeps deltas for earlier ones, making new
development faster. Additional discussions concerning SCCS vs RCS
are at 
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part7">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part7</A></P>
<P><B>Note that RCS learned from the mistakes of SCCS... </B></P>
<P>CVS, which requires RCS, extends RCS 
to control concurrent editing of sources by several users
working on releases built from a hierarchical set of 
directories. "RCS is [analogous to using] assembly language, while CVS is
[like using] Pascal". </P>
