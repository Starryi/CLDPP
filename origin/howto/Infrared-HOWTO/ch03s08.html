   This will tell you how to set up a masqueraded PPP connection via.
   IrDA from WinCE to a Linux based notebook computer. Once you are IP
   connected, the rest is up to you. We put this together as a guide for
   Sony notebook users with Casio E-100/105 PDA's, though the procedure
   should work for any WinCE 2.11 device with infrared capabilities
   talking to any notebook. Do all the Linux side testing signed on as
   root, standard warnings apply.
</p><p>
Configure WinCE

   Configure a network connection for your WinCE device. Go into
   "Connections" and create a "Direct Connection" Name it something
   meaningful, for device select "Infrared Port". Go into settings and
   change the baud rate to 115200, this is the max for WinCE. Go to
   TCP/IP settings and check "Use server-assigned IP address," and "Use
   software compression," and "Use IP header compression" Make sure "Use
   Slip," is unchecked. For Name Servers, make sure "Use server-assigned
   addresses" is checked. Go to Start, Settings, Communications,
   Identification and enter something for the Device Name. (I used
   "cetoy") You most likely already have these values set if you have
   synced with a Win9x desktop using Activesynch.
</p><p>
Configure Linux/IrDA

   Set up IrDA support on your notebook (described elsewhere) and get to
   the point where your notebook will discover an IrDA compliant device.
   A good sign is the irda0 device will show up when you execute
   ifconfig. It will not have an IP address, this is ok.
</p><p>
Setup the Connection

   Test the discovery by setting an IrDA device in range of your IR port,
   wait 5 seconds, and;
</p><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>cat /proc/net/irda/discovery</strong></span>
</p><p>
   For example, the Ericsson I888 World Phone with IR port enabled should
   immediately show something like this;
</p><p>

</p><pre class="programlisting">
"name:I 888 WORLD   ,hint:0x9104,saddr:0x838470e5,daddr:0x152dceaa"
</pre><p>

   Your WinCE machine will not be discovered unless it's actively looking
   for a connection. So, if you want to test with WinCE position your
   device and double tap on the network icon you created in step 2, you
   should see something like this:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="programlisting">
"name:mytoy,hint:0x8204,saddr:0x838470e5,daddr:0x00000b72"
</pre><p>

   The name displayed will be whatever value you have entered into the
   Start, Settings, Communications, Identification as the Device Name. At
   this point, with basic IrDA functioning- we can move on to
   establishing a PPP connection for WinCE. These scripts can also be
   used for serial cable connects. Create the following files and copy
   them into the directory indicated.
</p><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>/usr/sbin/cebox.sh</strong></span> - make it executable

</p><pre class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
pppd call cebox
</pre><p>

   Because Microsoft likes to break standards, you need the following
   chat script. This will feed WinCE the proper ASCII keywords it wants
   before allowing a PPP connection.
</p><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>/etc/ppp/cebox.chat</strong></span>

</p><pre class="programlisting">
TIMEOUT 3600
"CLIENT"    "CLIENT\c"
""      "SERVER\c"
</pre><p>

   The following file will allow you to specify the IP addresses, IR (or
   serial port if using a cable) device, DNS and so forth. I do not
   recommend you change the 192.IP addresses below. WinCE really has an
   affection for 192.168.55.100 because all the MS synch tools seem to
   have it hardcoded. DNS can be whatever you normally use.
</p><p>
   /etc/ppp/peers/cebox

</p><pre class="programlisting">
/dev/ircomm0 115200 crtscts
connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/cebox.chat'
noauth
local
192.168.55.101:192.168.55.100
ms-dns 10.2.0.1
</pre><p>

</p><p>
Testing the connection

   Ok, now you can test the connection to make sure it all works. Reboot
   your machine, run irattach /dev/ttyS2 -s (/dev/ttyS2 being the
   serial port your BIOS sees the IR device as, if irattach is not
   running, start it) Align the IR ports, at the Linux command prompt
   type /usr/sbin/cebox.sh, and simultaneously press return to start
   cebox and double tap your connection icon in WinCE. You should get a
   happy message from WinCE reporting Connecting to Host, Device
   Connected, Authenticating User, User Authenticated and finally
   Connected. You should see something like this when you are connected:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
irda0     Link encap:IrLAP  HWaddr 06:89:d0:58
      UP RUNNING NOARP  MTU:2048  Metric:1

      TX packets:251 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
      collisions:0 txqueuelen:8

      TX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

</pre><p>

   The following script sets up IrDA, establishes a ppp connection with
   WinCE, and then sets up IP masquerading. It is provided as an example
   of how you can tie this all together. This is more or less a manual
   approach. You can get creative, start irattach at boot and stick a
   line in inittab to constantly look for a WinCE connection on the IR
   port. This will however, run down your batteries and limit your
   ability to access other IR gadgets. I just use the script below.
   Position the device, run wince and start communications on your PDA
   when the script tells you to.
</p><p>
   <code class="filename">/usr/local/bin/wince</code> - make this executable

</p><pre class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
#
# Enable IrDA, start ppp0 and set up WinCE masquerading
# A. Tyde - Linuxcare Inc.
#
print "\n-&gt; Setting up IR infrastructure...\n";
system("killall irattach 2&gt;/dev/null");
sleep 1;
system("/usr/sbin/cebox.sh");
print "   Start WinCE Serial or IR networking now!\n";
open(ECHO,"&gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward") or die "Can not open /proc/sys/net/
ipv4/ip_forward";
print ECHO "1";
close (ECHO);
print "   Serving 192.168.55.100 to WinCE device...\n\n";
system("ipchains -F");
sleep 5;
system("ipchains -P forward DENY");
system("ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.55.100/32 -j MASQ");
exit 0;
