   This section covers how to connect a PocketPC device to a Linux
   box. The information provided in section "Connecting from Linux to
   WinCE" (found also at 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cewindows.net/wce/linux-serial.htm" target="_top">CEwindows</a>
   )
   does not apply to PocketPC as Microsoft in one of there brighter
   moments removed support for direct IrDA connections from version 3.0 of
   WinCE. I used the document "Linux to Windows CE Connection" (found at
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/linux_ce.html" target="_top">The Gadgeteer</a>
   ) as a starting point, but
   had to modify and simplify several aspects. This section will go as
   far as <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> between PocketPC and Linux. You should be able to find
   many networking applications at 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pdacentral.com/wince/ftp.htm" target="_top">PDAcentral</a>,

   Here is the system I used:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
   Compaq iPAQ with PocketPC Version 3.0.9348 (I don't know if this
   would work for PocketPC 2002 as Microsoft likes changing standards
   from version to version).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   On the Linux side was a Compaq LTE5250 laptop with Slackware Linux 7.1.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Kernel 2.4.19
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   PPP 2.4.1 (PPP must not be older than 2.4.0 when used with kernel 2.4.x)
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
   On the PocketPC side go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; Modem. 
   Make a new connection, call it something meaningful (I use
   Linux-m), choose "Generic IrDA modem", set baud rate to 115200. Tap
   "Advanced". In "Port Settings" select 8-N-1-Hardware and check "Enter
   dialing commands manually". This is done so as PocketPC would not try
   to dial a phone number as we do not want it. The other two boxes
   should remain unchecked. In TCP/IP select "Use server-assigned IP
   address" uncheck "Use Slip", but check "Use software compression" and
   "Use IP header compression". In "name Servers" select "Use
   server-assigned addresses". Tap "ok" and "Next". You should not be
   asked for telephone number (if you are, just enter 1 and doublecheck
   that you actually selected manual dialing commands box in advanced
   section). Make sure that "Cancel call..." and "Wait for dial tone..."
   boxes are unchecked. We are now done with the PocketPC part.
</p><p>
   On Linux we must first make sure that all the necessary modules are
   loaded. Here are the modules that were loaded and in use during a
   successful communication session:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
ircomm-tty             31040   2
ircomm                 13448   0  [ircomm-tty]
irtty                   7616   2
ppp_async               6688   1
ppp_generic            15740   3  [ppp_async]
slhc                    4592   1  [ppp_generic]
</pre><p>

   Make sure that <span class="command"><strong>ls -la /dev/ircomm*</strong></span> produces a similar output:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
crw-------   1 root     root     161,   0 Nov 25 15:09 /dev/ircomm0
crw-r--r--   1 root     root     161,   1 Nov 22 19:30 /dev/ircomm1
</pre><p>

   Start irattach <span class="command"><strong>irattach /dev/ttyS2 -s</strong></span>
</p><p>
   Now we have to enable a login terminal on the IrDA port. I used
   <span class="command"><strong>agetty</strong></span> (or your favorite getty variant) 
   for that purpose. Add the following line
   to your <code class="filename">/etc/inittab</code>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
s3:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty ircomm0 115200 vt100
</pre><p>

   save the file and activate it by restarting <span class="command"><strong>init</strong></span>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
init 2; sleep 3 ; init 3
</pre><p>

   Also prepare the following shell script that will perform the second
   phase of connection:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/pppd -detach noauth local lock 192.168.55.1:192.168.55.2 ircomm0 115200 &amp;
</pre><p>

</p><p>
   Now the connection itself: Align the IR ports and on the PocketPC go
   to Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Connections and tap the connection that you
   created (Linux-m). In the "Connect To" dialog that shows up leave
   everything unfilled and just tap on "Connect". "Manual Dialing
   Terminal" will show up. There you should see the login prompt for
   your Linux-box (If the login prompt does not show up at once, bring up
   the virtual keyboard and tap 'enter'). You do not need to login
   (though it is a bonus - speaking of the ultimate remote controller :)
</p><p>
   On the Linux-box execute the <span class="command"><strong>pppd</strong></span> command as soon as some "garbage"
   shows up in the PocketPC's terminal, tap "File" -&gt; "Continue". 
   <span class="command"><strong>pppd</strong></span> should come with the following message:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Using interface ppp0
Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; /dev/ircomm0
Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP
local  IP address 192.168.55.1
remote IP address 192.168.55.2
</pre><p>

   And PocketPC should show a dialog with "Status: Connected". You can
   run <span class="command"><strong>ifconfig</strong></span> to check that ppp0 interface is up and running. 
   
   <span class="command"><strong>ping 192.168.55.2</strong></span> should produce something like that:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

64 bytes from 192.168.55.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=32 time=62.5 ms

5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 59.8/110.4/310.0 ms
</pre><p>
   
   RTT will depend on the distance and lighting conditions.
   
   When you tap "Disconnect" something like that will show up:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
LCP terminated by peer
Modem hangup
Connection terminated.
Connect time 2.6 minutes.
Sent 1336 bytes, received 1274 bytes.
</pre><p>

</p><p>
   Now, if not all went that well, check the following:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>getty</strong></span> is started. It will not start if 
   <code class="filename">/dev/ircomm0</code> is not
   configured. That is <span class="command"><strong>modprobe ircomm-tty</strong></span> 
   should come up before getty is invoked.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   "Enter dialing commands manually" is checked. PocketPC should not
   attempt to dial any number!
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   You have async PPP support in kernel. <span class="command"><strong>modprobe ppp_async</strong></span>
   loads successfully or you don't have PPP async compiled into kernel. Otherwise you
   will get the "Couldn't set tty to PPP discipline: Invalid argument" error
   message.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>pppd</strong></span> should be setuid root: 
   <span class="command"><strong>chmod u+s /usr/sbin/pppd</strong></span>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
