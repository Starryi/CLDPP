   Please read the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO/" target="_top">Kernel-HOWTO</a>
   from TLDP to get more information about the compilation process.
   Thomas Hertweck has written another useful
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thomashertweck.de/kernel.html" target="_top">Linux-Kernel-HOWTO</a>
   (but it is only available in German and Italian).
   Check the
   <a class="ulink" href="http://irda.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Linux/IrDA Project</a>
   or the Linux/IrDA mailing list archives for latest patches. 
</p><p>
   You'll find the Linux/IrDA Kernel code in:
</p><p>
   /usr/src/linux/net/irda (protocol stuff)
</p><p>
   /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/irda (device drivers)
</p><p>
   /usr/src/linux/include/net/irda (header files)
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm236"></a>2.2. General Parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Make sure you use kernel 2.6 sources. I recommend not to use 
   any earlier kernel version, but this document will describe
   differences to the kernel 2.4 series in the appropriate places.
   If unsure about your kernel version try <span class="command"><strong>uname -r</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   For current 2.6 kernels there are no patches necessary.
   In case there is a kernel patch from the Linux/IrDA project or
   other places to apply (for example for kernel 2.4), 
   put it into the directory <code class="filename">/usr/src</code> 
   or where else your kernel sources live and apply something like (replace
   <code class="filename">patch-2_4.0-irdaXXX</code> with the actual file name):

</p><pre class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src
tar xvzf patch-2_4.0-irdaXXX.tar.gz
cd linux
patch -p1 -l &lt; ../patch-2_4.0-irdaXXX
</pre><p>

   For latest drivers experimental support has to be enabled
   <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL</strong></span>, at least in kernel 2.4.
</p><p>
   Enable sysctl in "General Setup" <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_SYSCTL</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   You should have proc file system support <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_PROC_FS</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   Also serial support for the SIR features <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_SERIAL</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   I am not sure whether there has to be printer support for using a
   printer with Linux/IrDA <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_PRINTER</strong></span>. But I assume this feature is
   not necessary.
</p><p>
   Networking support _must_ be enabled <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_NET</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   Make sure you have module support <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_MODULES</strong></span> in your kernel! Test
   it e.g. with <span class="command"><strong>lsmod</strong></span>.
</p><p>

   Also kerneld support <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_KERNELD</strong></span>. But <span class="command"><strong>kmod</strong></span> 
   (<span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_KMOD</strong></span>) also
   works. A monolithic kernel seems to work, too. But modules are highly
   recommended!
</p><p>
   To use <span class="command"><strong>irdadump</strong></span> you probably have to set <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_PACKET</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   If you only apply the Linux/IrDA patch, you should not have to do a
   make clean, so that should save you some time. I suggest you do
   something like this:
</p><p>
   For kernel 2.4 use: 
   <span class="command"><strong>make dep &amp;&amp; make all &amp;&amp; make modules 
   &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make modules_install</strong></span>.
   For kernel 2.6 use: 
   <span class="command"><strong>make all &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make modules_install</strong></span>.
   If you get really strange errors, then try to rebuild from scratch
   after a <span class="command"><strong>make clean</strong></span>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm270"></a>2.3. IrDA Specific Parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
   The following is from

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm276"></a>2.3.1. IrDA subsystem support</h4></div></div></div><p>
CONFIG_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrDA (TM) protocols.
  The Infrared Data Associations (tm) specifies standards for wireless
  infrared communication and is supported by most laptops and PDA's.
</p><p>
  To use Linux support for the IrDA (tm) protocols, you will also need
  some user-space utilities like irattach
  . For more information, see the file
  Documentation/networking/irda.txt. You also want to read the
  InfraRed-HOWTO, available at 
  <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/howtos.html" target="_top">TuxMobil</a>
  .
</p><p>
  This support is also available as a module called irda.o. If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.
</p><p>
IrDA Cache last LSAP
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRDA_CACHE_LAST_LSAP
  Say Y here if you want IrLMP to cache the last LSAP used. This makes
  sense since most frames will be sent/received on the same
  connection. Enabling this option will save a hash-lookup per frame.
</p><p>
  If unsure, say Y.
</p><p>
IrDA Fast RR's
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRDA_FAST_RR
  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
  when acting as a primary station. This will make IrLAP send out a RR
  frame immediately when receiving a frame if its own transmit queue
  is currently empty. This will give a lot of speed improvement when
  receiving much data since the secondary station will not have to
  wait the max. turn around time before it is allowed to transmit the
  next time. If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty the
  primary will back off waiting longer for sending out the RR frame
  until the timeout reaches the normal value. Enabling this option
  will make the IR-diode burn more power and thus reduce your battery
  life.
</p><p>
  If unsure, say N.
</p><p>
IrDA Debug
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRDA_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want the IrDA subsystem to write debug information
  to your syslog. You can change the debug level in
  <code class="filename">/proc/sys/net/irda/debug</code>
</p><p>
  If unsure, say Y (since it makes it easier to find the bugs).
</p><p>
IrLAP Compression support
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRDA_COMPRESSION
  Compression is _not_ part of the IrDA(tm) protocol specification,
  but it's working great! Linux is the first to try out compression
  support at the IrLAP layer. This means that you will only benefit
  from compression if you are running a Linux &lt;-&gt; Linux configuration.
</p><p>
  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y or M to a compression
  protocol below.
</p><p>
IrLAP Deflate Compression Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRDA_DEFLATE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Deflate compression
  protocol. The deflate compression (GZIP) is exactly
  the same as the one used by the PPP protocol. 
</p><p>
  If you want to compile this compression support as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  irda_deflate.o.
</p><p>
IrLAN Protocol 
   But currently the IrLAN protocol is no longer maintained
   by the Linux/IrDA core team.
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRLAN
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrLAN protocol. If
  you want to compile it as a module (irlan.o), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and makes it
  possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.
</p><p>
  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points 
  like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET. You can also connect 
  to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc 
  networking!
</p><p>
IrCOMM Protocol
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRCOMM
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrCOMM protocol. If
  you want to compile it as a module (you will get <span class="command"><strong>ircomm.o</strong></span> and
  <span class="command"><strong>ircomm-tty.o</strong></span>), say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrCOMM
  implements serial port emulation, and makes it possible to use all
  existing applications that understands TTY's with an infrared link.
  Thus you should be able to use application like PPP, minicom and
  others. Enabling this option will create two modules called <code class="filename">ircomm</code>
  and <code class="filename">ircomm-tty</code>.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm307"></a>2.3.2. Device Drivers</h4></div></div></div><p>
IrTTY IrDA Device Driver
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRTTY_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
  discipline. If you want to compile it as a module (irtty.o), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrTTY makes it possible to
  use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that are 16550
  compatible. Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you should
  probably say Y to this option. Using IrTTY will however limit the
  speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode)
</p><p>
  If unsure, say Y.
</p><p>
IrPORT IrDA Device Driver
</p><p>
CONFIG_IRPORT_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
  driver. If you want to compile it as a module (irport.o), say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. IrPORT can be used instead of
  IrTTY and sometimes this can be better. One example is if your IrDA
  port does not have echo-canceling, which will work OK with IrPORT
  since this driver is working in half-duplex mode only. You don't
  need to use <span class="command"><strong>irattach</strong></span> with IrPORT, but you just insert it the same
  way as FIR drivers (<span class="command"><strong>insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11</strong></span>). Notice that
  IrPORT is a SIR device driver which means that speed is limited to
  115200 bps.
</p><p>
  If unsure, say Y.
</p><p>
Winbond W83977AF IrDA Device Driver
</p><p>
CONFIG_WINBOND_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build IrDA support for the Winbond
  W83977AF super-io chipset. This driver should be used for the IrDA
  chipset in the Corel NetWinder. The driver supports SIR, MIR and FIR
  (4Mbps) speeds.
</p><p>
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called w83977af_ir.o.
</p><p>
NSC PC87108 IrDA Device Driver
</p><p>
CONFIG_NSC_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the NSC PC87108 and
  PC87338 IrDA chipsets. This driver supports SIR, 
  MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds. 
</p><p>
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called nsc-ircc.o.
</p><p>
Toshiba Type-O IR Port Device Driver
</p><p>
CONFIG_TOSHIBA_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Toshiba Type-O IR
  chipset. This chipset is used by the Toshiba Libretto 100CT, and
  many more laptops. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  toshoboe.o.
</p><p>
SMC IrCC (Experimental)
</p><p>
CONFIG_SMC_IRCC_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the SMC Infrared
  Communications Controller. It is used in the Fujitsu Lifebook 635t
  and Sony PCG-505TX. If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called
  smc-ircc.o.
</p><p>
ALi M5123 FIR Controller Driver (Experimental)
</p><p>
CONFIG_ALI_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the ALi M5123 FIR 
  Controller. The ALi M5123 FIR Controller is embedded in ALi
  M1543C, M1535, M1535D, M1535+, M1535D South Bridge. This 
  driver supports SIR, MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.
</p><p>
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be called ali-ircc.o.
</p><p>
Serial dongle support
</p><p>
CONFIG_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you have an infrared device that connects to your
  computer's serial port. These devices are called dongles. Then say Y
  or M to the driver for your particular dongle below.
</p><p>
  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause this configure script to skip all
</p><p>
ESI JetEye PC Dongle
</p><p>
CONFIG_ESI_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Extended Systems
  JetEye PC dongle. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. The ESI dongle attaches to the
  normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can currently only be used
  by IrTTY. To activate support for ESI dongles you will have to
  start irattach like this: <span class="command"><strong>irattach -d esi</strong></span>.
</p><p>
ACTiSYS IR-220L and IR220L+ dongle
</p><p>
CONFIG_ACTISYS_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the ACTiSYS
  IR-220L and IR220L+ dongles. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The ACTiSYS dongles
  attaches to the normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can
  currently only be used by IrTTY. To activate support for ACTiSYS
  dongles you will have to start irattach like this: 
  <span class="command"><strong>irattach -d actisys</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>irattach -d actisys+</strong></span>.
</p><p>
Tekram IrMate 210B dongle
</p><p>
CONFIG_TEKRAM_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Tekram IrMate 210B 
  dongle. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. The Tekram dongle attaches to
  the normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can currently only be
  used by IrTTY. To activate support for Tekram dongles you will have
  to start <span class="command"><strong>irattach</strong></span> like this: <span class="command"><strong>irattach -d tekram</strong></span>.
</p><p>
Greenwich GIrBIL dongle
</p><p>
CONFIG_GIRBIL_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Greenwich GIrBIL
  dongle. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. The Greenwich dongle attaches to the
  normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can currently only be used
