   Try to find out which serial port is used by the IR device. You
   may do so by watching the output of 
   <span class="command"><strong>dmesg</strong></span>. If serial support is
   modularized do an <span class="command"><strong>modprobe serial</strong></span>
   first. Look for an entry like:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Serial driver version 4.25 with no serial options enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A     #first serial port /dev/ttyS0
ttyS01 at 0x3000 (irq = 10) is a 16550A    #e.g. infrared port
ttyS02 at 0x0300 (irq = 3) is a 16550A     #e.g. PCMCIA modem port
</pre><p>

   If this is not the case, you either don't have infrared support
   enabled in the BIOS or the SIR mode of your infrared device is not
   detected by the kernel. Currently I know only two laptop models
   with this effect, the HP OmniBook 800 and the Toshiba Libretto
   models. I am not sure whether PnP support effects the detection of
   the IR port. If you are unsure try it out and let me know the
   results. Maybe you can use FIR mode if SIR doesn't work.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   In some situations you may have to use 
   <span class="command"><strong>setserial /dev/ttyS&lt;0-2&gt; port 0xNNNN irq M</strong></span>
   to set the values for your infrared serial port,
   especially if the infrared port is a separate serial line. You
   usually don't need to change the values! For further information
   look into the FAQ section below.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   If you don't use <span class="command"><strong>kerneld</strong></span> or 
   <span class="command"><strong>kmod</strong></span> insert the irda module with
   <span class="command"><strong>modprobe irda</strong></span>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Do <span class="command"><strong>lsmod</strong></span>. It should show the modules irda and irtty now.

   A look into /var/log/messages should show the entry "Serial

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Give <span class="command"><strong>irattach</strong></span> some time, e.g. 
   seven seconds, to detect other IR
   devices. Then watch the output from the kernel that you will
   hopefully get in /var/log/messages. It should look like the
   following (I removed some lines, which were not related to
   Linux/IrDA):

   The IrDA(TM) standard knows three kinds of speeds:
</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
SIR = Standard IrDA, up to 115kbps IrDA,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
MIR = Medium Speed IrDA,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
FIR = Fast IrDA (4Mbps),
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
VFIR = Very Fast IrDA(16Mbps), seems to become a future standard
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
   Up to 115.200bps (SIR) many (probably all) infrared controllers work
   like a serial port and use a RZI (return to zero, inverted)
   modulation. Not every infrared controller supports 4Mps (FIR), up to
   4Mbps they have to use 4PPM (4 pulse position) modulation technique.
   A list of supported FIR chips is included in
   <code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/irda/Kconfig</code>. 
   
   You may start the FIR
   service by loading the according module. Linux/IrDA will probe your
   hardware then. More drivers are under development.
</p><p>
   So what speeds can you expect? Using SIR, you should be able to get
   about 10 Kbytes/s. Using FIR (4Mbps) you can get over 300 Kbytes/s (if
   you are lucky).

   A survey of supported dongles is included in
   <code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/irda/Kconfig</code>. 
   
</p><p>
   Dag Brattli wrote (modified by wh): "To use dongles you have to do
   something like this:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
modprobe tekram         # or esi or actisys
irattach -d tekram      # or -d esi or -d actisys
</pre><p>

   <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span> is not necessary, if 
   <code class="filename">/etc/modules.conf</code> is correct.
   As you can see, you must still use the <span class="command"><strong>-d</strong></span>
   option with <span class="command"><strong>irattach</strong></span> since
   it is possible to have two serial ports using different dongles at the
   same time (so the tty you are binding must know which dongle it is
   supposed to use). So if you have two dongles and two serial ports, you
   could do something like this:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
modprobe tekram
modprobe esi
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d esi &amp;
irattach /dev/ttyS1 -d tekram &amp;
</pre><p>

   PS: I would not try to turn the two dongles against each other, since
   I really don't know how the stack would react :-) ... Since I don't
   have any of these new ACTiSYS 220L+ dongles, I'm not able to test it.
   Since the new dongle has support for one extra speed (38400bps), you
   must specify the dongles differently with 
   <span class="command"><strong>irattach</strong></span> so that the kernel
   knows which dongle you are using (and what QoS can be used):

</p><pre class="programlisting">
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys     # for the 220L dongle
irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys+    # for the 220L+ dongle
</pre><p>

   The current implementation of dongle support does not have any state
   associated with it, so its not possible to use both ACTiSYS dongles
   (220L and 220L+) at the same time (connected to two serial ports) for
   now. If someone needs to be able to do so, please mail me (Dag
   Brattli) and I will think about it!"
</p><p>
   Note: When I tried to use an infrared modem (Swissmod 56Ki,
   manufactured by Telelink AG) connected to my laptop (IrDA works with
   Microsoft-Window$95 only, due to non-standard hardware) I had to remove the
   infrared support in the BIOS to get it working!
</p><p>
   Dag Brattli: "It is now possible to use 
   <span class="command"><strong>irport</strong></span> instead of <span class="command"><strong>irtty</strong></span>! I
   have moved all the dongle stuff out of <span class="command"><strong>irtty</strong></span> 
   and into <span class="command"><strong>irda_device</strong></span>, so
   it will also be possible to attach dongles to irport. Need however to
   make a small user-space utility <span class="command"><strong>dongle_attach</strong></span> 
   that can be used to
   attach dongles to a specific driver instance. 
   BTW: <span class="command"><strong>irattach</strong></span> is still
   working as before, and you will not notice the difference even when
   attaching dongles to <span class="command"><strong>irtty</strong></span> 
   (I've just redirected the dongle ioctl to
   <span class="command"><strong>irda_device</strong></span>). Irport may be 
   interesting since you avoid one software
   interrupt (bh) level, and it's also forced to work in half duplex mode
   so you don't get any echo if the irda port itself don't have
   echo-cancellation (Girbil dongle and HP-4000 etc) ... To use it, you
   must supply the parameters to <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span> 
   like this: <span class="command"><strong>modprobe irport io=0x3f8
   irq=4</strong></span>, or whichever 
   values you use. You can also add these parameters
   to 
   <code class="filename">/etc/modprobe.conf</code> (kernel 2.6)
   or
   <code class="filename">/etc/modules.conf</code> (kernel 2.4)
   like this: 
   <span class="command"><strong>options irport io=0x3f8 irq=4</strong></span>, but
   then you must remember to do a <span class="command"><strong>depmod -a</strong></span>
   and use <span class="command"><strong>modprobe irport</strong></span>
   instead of <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span>."

   From James I have this description about setting
   up the hardware: There are two configurations, a five pin in line
   connector and a 6 pin DIL (at the end of a 18 pin DIL header).
   Basically any IrDA compatible transceiver will work (I have a stack of
   old IRM3001 these are now obselete) you need to hook a capacitor (use
   a tantalum about ~1uF) between 5V and 0V near the transceiver and then
   connect everthing else up 
   (RX-&gt;RX, TX-&gt;TX, 5V-&gt;5V, and 0V-0V). If you
   don't like soldering irons, lots of companies do sell IR modules for
   the 5 pin connectors that fit into a hole in your case.
