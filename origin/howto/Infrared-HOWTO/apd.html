   This section summarizes some ideas and thoughts that were exchanged on the
   Linux/IrDA mailing list. It is not medically well-founded, and whoever has
   better evidence or some more well-founded source of information is
   encouraged to contribute it to this HOWTO.
</p><p>
   The IrDA spec says that the range of IrDA devices has been limited to 1m for
   reasons of eye safety. Another plausible assumption is that power
   consumption and IR pollution/crosstalk were reasons for this limitation. In
   principle there could be danger for the eye, because infrared light is not
   registered by the eye, and thus the pupil won't close in order to protect
   the retina from bright IR light sources. This is the same situation as with
   UV light, which will cause snow blindness eventually, but in contrast to UV
   light, IR light contains much less harmful energy due to its longer
   wavelength.
</p><p>
   The only legal restrictions and medical advices we were able to find on
   the web were concerned with infrared emissions of heat lamps or in the
   welding process and IEC 825-1 (CENELEC EN60825-1). This suggests that IR
   light as emitted by IrDA devices will be harmless, since even the peak
   power emitted by strong IR LEDs (ca. 300mW) is several orders of
   magnitude below the power emitted by medical IR heat lamps (up to 500W).
   For these, however, you are supposed to wear protective goggles, so
   maybe if you are looking straight into 1.000 infrared LEDs flashing at
   once, you should do so, too. The effect of infrared light is mostly
   heat, though, and not an alteration or destruction of the biological
   cell structure, such as caused by UV light. Though in the specs for the
   HP OmniBook 800 Hewlett-Packard recommends not to look directly into the
   IR LED.
</p><p>
   As stated above, this discussion is only based on guesswork and common
   sense assumptions about the data found in IR LED and heat lamp specs.
   If anybody with a better medical knowledge can comment on this, please
   do so!
