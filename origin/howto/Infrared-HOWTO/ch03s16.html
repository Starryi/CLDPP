   The Linux/IrDA keyboard driver is now in user-space. Please see
   chapter Connection to Docking Station above.

   Lichen Wang: "The so called IrDA-D standard is designed to transfer
   Data. It is not suitable for IR Keyboard. IrDA-D is what Dag ported to
   Linux OS and what MS ported to Windows OS.
</p><p>
   The so called IrDA-C (Control) is designed for Keyboard, Joy-stick,
   etc. I am not aware that there is any product in the market that is
   using it yet.
</p><p>
   IrDA-D cannot talk to IrDA-C. IrDA-C cannot talk to IrDA-D either.
   Both the physical encoding/decoding and the software protocol are very
   different.
</p><p>
   It is possible to implement both IrDA-D and IrDA-C in the same device.
   Sharp says that IrDA-D and IrDA-C can coexist -- as long as both of
   them are not used at the same time in the same IR space. This sounds
   rather funny to me. According to this definition, anything can
   co-exist with anything as long as you do not destroy the universe
   permanently in the process ;-)
</p><p>
   Seriously, what SHARP says is that they can tailor the IrDA-D so that
   there are some unused time between the negotiated maximum turnaround
   time and the actual transmission. They then squeeze the IrDA-C frames
   in those unused time. The IrDA-D Primary and IrDA-C Master must be
   implemented in the same device. The keyboards will work, but mice and
   joysticks may be sluggish at times."
