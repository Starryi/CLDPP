   Dag Brattli: "Connection to the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tekram.com/" target="_top">Tekram IRDocking IR-660</a>
   
   . This device is
   a docking station with LAN access, printer, mouse and keyboard. You
   can also use them at the same time as the internal mouse and keyboard!
   Just fire up <span class="command"><strong>gpm -t ps2 /dev/irkbd</strong></span> and the laptop will make a
   keyboard/mouse connection to the IR-660. Now I just have to make gpm
   read both /dev/psaux and /dev/irkbd, and then make X11 read
   /dev/gpmdata, and I should have the thing configured!
</p><p>
   ... one problem: gpm can handle multiple mice, but Linux cannot handle
   multiple different keyboards. So if you have one norwegian keyboard
   and one remote US keyboard like I have, then things will be a little
   bit confusing. I got a hint from Alan Cox about a project that is
   implementing real support for multiple keyboards, so I'll check that
   out.
</p><p>
   ... OK, I sort of worked it out. By using TIOCSTI on /dev/console, you
   can insert scancodes directly into the tty queue. This can be a
   problem for virtual consoles that expect to receive some translated
   and cooked keycodes, but X happens to like raw scancodes, so this will
   work quite nice when using X but not for other virtual consoles.
   Anyway this is good enough for me, so I will not use a lot of time
   converting the scancodes to keycodes and index them with some keymap
   just to make it work with text only virtual consoles. As I see it the
   irkbd driver has now been successfully been ported to user-space :-)
</p><p>
   ... the Tekram IR-660 device can, in addition to attach a keyboard and
   mouse, also print using IrTTP (it can print using IrLPT, but that is
   not so funny since it requires exclusive use of IrLMP, and you don't
   wan't to stop the network, mouse and keyboard just to print a
   document). I'll try and see if I can get IrTTP printing working using
   a fifo as well.
</p><p>
   ... Tekram has added a control channel in addition to the data channel
   so that you can get some status information about what is going on.
   The name of their own protocol is P1248. It's published through the
   "P1248" class and "IrDA:TinyTP:LsapSel" LM-IAS entry, so you can try
   to find it.
</p><p>
   ... Canon is using the P1248 protocol, and their printer monitor
   program BrintBuddy2 (Japanese version) is using this protocol now. I
   don't know what they use for the data channel. Maybe they support
   TinyTP directly in addition to the other methods. You can try and look
   up the "IrLPT" class with the "IrDA:TinyTP:LsapSel" in the LM-IAS and
   see if you can find it."
