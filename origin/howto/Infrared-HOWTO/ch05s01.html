   Sometimes IrCOMM fails to connect, especially when both devices
   discover each other. You can disable discovering with 
   <span class="command"><strong>echo 0 &gt;/proc/sys/net/irda/discovery</strong></span>.
</p><p>
   A CR (carriage return) character cannot be transfered between two
   linux boxes via IrCOMM with <span class="command"><strong>cat file &gt;/dev/ircomm0</strong></span>
   and <span class="command"><strong>cat /dev/ircomm0</strong></span>.
   It causes a strange thing and freezes your Linux box.

   IrOBEX may eat some data on receive. The bug is most probably in the
   user-space side of IrOBEX.

   It is also possible to debug the code. But I don't know how to do
   this. If you want to use SKB debug code, you may edit irda.h and
   change /include/linux/skbuff.h (see revision history of snapshot
   10-2-98).

   For problems with the irda module a utility from the modules
   package kdstat might be helpful. But I was not able to try this.

   "You can now alter the number of discovery packets used (1, 6, 8
   or 16) and the timeout between sending them (2-8 * 10 ms) in
   /proc/sys/net/irda. Please experiment if you have problems
   discovering your device. My Palm III seems to like 16
   discovery_slots and 8 (*10 ms) for slot_timeout. " ... "The
   absolute minimum for reliable discovery of the IR-610 seems to be
   9."
   Another statement: ... the Palm III does not like 8 discovery
   frames in a row, but 6 is OK. With 8 it will answer 1 out of 6-10
   times, with 6 it answers every time. I really don't know if this
   is a problem with Linux-IrDA or the Palm III. One solution to this
   problem, is to cycle though some different discovery methods for
   each discovery like this:
   Disocvery 1: send 8 xid frames with 80 ms separation
   If answer, keep the same config, if no answer, try next config
   Discovery 2: send 6 xid frames with 80 ms separation
   Discovery 3: send 8 xid frames with 90 ms separation
   Discovery 4: send 6 xid frames with 90 ms separation
   Discovery 5. Go back to 1.
   or some other pattern and maybe more combinations.
   Maybe this is sometimes implemented, so it would be enabled if
   /proc/sys/net/irda/discovery_slots is set to 0 .

If anybody gets a kernel Oops, then please feed it to the
   <code class="filename">../linux/scripts/ksymoops/ksymoops</code>

   out where it went wrong. Just cut out the Oops lines from the
   syslog, save them to a file, and then run 
   <span class="command"><strong>ksymoops &lt;file&gt;</strong></span>.

   giving me several hundred interrupts per second! I removed the
   sound stuff from my kernel, and the machine is now generally about
   4 times faster! Linux/IrDA may get problems if you are running the
   esound server (esd) on your machine. Both my machines, a 166Mhz
   Pentium laptop and a 200Mhz Pentium Pro cannot run Linux/IrDA when
   esd is running. The reason is that esd makes the soundcard give
   interrups over 300 times/second which makes the serial driver
   overrun when receiving. This is because the serial driver now uses
   slow interrupts in Linux-2.2 (everything is slow interrupts in
   2.2), so the interrupt-handler schedules on its way out. The good
   thing about slow interrupts is that packets are delivered much
   faster, since you don't need to wait for the next timer-tick. The
   only exception for this is the pc87108 driver which works fine
   since it uses DMA and will only give a couple of interrupts per
   packet.

   AFAIK it is possible to use IrCOMM either with an infrared device
   or via serial cable. Maybe this give some debugging possibilities,
   too.

   1) You may edit /etc/conf.modules, adding the following lines:
      option irda irda_debug=3
   2) Make sure the irda modules have been totally removed.
   3) Edit /etc/syslog.conf, adding the following lines:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
*/*         -/var/log/all
</pre><p>

   4) Do killall -1 syslogd .
   5) Print, or do whatever causes problems with irlpt .
   6) Check all the files in /var/log/ .

   For some ThinkPad models you have to reboot to the preinstalled M$ OS
   and activate the IrDA port using the Thinkpad tools. There is
   currently no Linux tool to achieve that. This will disable your
   internal serial port (ttyS0)!. The DOS tool is <span class="command"><strong>PS2.EXE</strong></span>, as far as I
   know <span class="command"><strong>tpctl</strong></span> doesn't achieve this. It is really important to use this
   DOS program to enable IrDA. Using the Microsoft-Windows tools does not
   work. Without that the driver loads correctly and everythings seems
   OK, but the LED does not light bright enough.

   <span class="command"><strong>scanport</strong></span> can be used to get the 
   correct device ID for a chip. It's
   part of the hwtools package (on Debian, probably same elsewhere). You
   just type it in and it scans the I/O ports from 0x100 to 0x400 - the
   usual ISA range. Above 0x400 there are shadows of below 0x400 devices,
   and beyond that there are PCI devices, so the default is not to scan
   above 0x400. "Anyway, I had to manually scan using inb to find my
   chip's I/O. Fortunately I didn't have to go far to find it. (Newer
   sound cards often sit at 0x530ish, with 0x220 reserved for legacy
   compatibility modes) Normally, if you know where some device is
   located you just point the driver at it and the driver probes to see
   if it's the device the driver is expecting. Not entirely safe, but
   much safer than every driver probing every I/O port looking for
   something it thinks it can understand. scanport only does reads, which
   are usually safe."
