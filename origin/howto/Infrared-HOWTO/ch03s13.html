   There should be four ways to get two Linux machines connected via
   Linux/IrDA.

   may wonder what prevents the beaming of files from Linux to Linux?
   Well, nothing!! (but I haven't tried that yet). This means that we
   now have a "simple" way of beaming files between Linux laptops. I
   think that this may be the "killer app" we all have been waiting
   for!" Try to "load_misc irobex at both ends, and then try
   irobex_app get on one of the machines and irobex_app put &lt;file&gt; on

   Via Linux/IrDA network connection.
   But the IrLAN protocol is no longer maintained
   by the Linux/IrDA core team.

   With IrCOMM support, in other words over a serial line, which
   could mean minicom, pppd, etc. If you want just now to use IrCOMM
   between Linux boxes, please add this line to /etc/conf.modules of
   _one_ box:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
# set ircomm protocol engine to client-only mode
options ircomm ircomm_cs=1
</pre><p>

   Note: Don't add it to both boxes, or they cannot accept incoming
   connection each other! But since 2.2.7 there's no need to add
   options ircomm ircomm_cs=1 to /etc/conf.modules anymore. Please
   remove it if you are using it.

   compression!!! This is something which is exclusive for Linux as far

   If you want to try using the compression code (Linux &lt;-&gt; Linux) you
   will have to insert the irda_deflate module some time before you
   actually make the connection. I do it before irattach.

   The compression standard I have added is the deflate format used by
   the zlib library which is described by RFCs (Request for Comments)
   1950 to 1952 in the files ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib
   format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).

   The compression interface is similar to PPP, so you can add as many
   different compressors as you want. Currently there is only support for
   GZIP, but BSD compression will be added later. ... Have just tested
   GZIP compression at 4Mbps. It was a really bad idea! Compressing the
   frames takes so much time that the performance is actually worse than
   when not using compression at all. The conclusion is that compression
   should only be used for SIR speeds, ..."
