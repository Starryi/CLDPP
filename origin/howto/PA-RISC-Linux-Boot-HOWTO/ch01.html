			(aka <span class="emphasis"><em>Woody</em></span>), a major improvement was
			made in term of quantity and quality of hardware support.
			Since 0.9.3 released<a href="#ftn.ftn-debian-support" class="footnote" name="ftn-debian-support"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>, the kernel has been
			greatly improved, so that much unsupported hardware by the time 0.9.3 went out
			is now handled. That's why even if your model is not listed here, you might
			give it a try and report your result to the mailing list:
			<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:parisc-linux@lists.parisc-linux.org">parisc-linux@lists.parisc-linux.org</a>&gt;</code>.
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Mind that as of this document's publication date, the 2.4 series of the
			Linux kernel are deemed obsolete, and no development happens in that branch.
			Any new comer to the PA-RISC/Linux port should look at the 2.6 kernel series,
			which supports much more hardware than the 2.4 does. Accordingly, one will not try
			to use the now aging <span class="emphasis"><em>Woody</em></span> release and will instead focus
			on its successor: <span class="emphasis"><em>Sarge</em></span>, or even better, the upcoming 
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Etch</em></span>.</p></div><p>The following PA-RISC machines should work just fine, provided that you follow the
			instructions of the present document.
			Please note that this list can change at any time.
			The best way to get an up to date version is to look at
			<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pateam.org/list.html" target="_top">http://www.pateam.org/list.html</a>.
			This is the place to find relevant information about a specific model,
			including special boot procedures.
			More hardware information can be found on <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openpa.net/" target="_top">OpenPA</a>.
		</p><p>
			SMP machines should work with SMP kernels (and UP ones, of course) unless stated otherwise.

                        Before the first release of Debian on hppa,
			there has been unofficial releases of Woody snapshots, entitled "PA/Linux releases",
			and numbered <span class="emphasis"><em>0.x</em></span>. Immediately after the release of Woody,
			the PA/Linux port switched to the normal Debian numbering scheme. In other words,
			Debian 3.0 is consecutive to PA/Linux 0.9.3.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pr01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Preparing to boot</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
