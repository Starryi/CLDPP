	 There are many details which have not been covered here, like how to distribute
	 Unix daemons, configuration files and much more.</p><p>

    But most important, I want to  emphasize again that for Debian 
maintainers,
packages are source packages, not binary packages. They never interact directly
with the internals binary packages. In fact only '<code class="literal">dpkg-deb</code>' and '<code class="literal">dpkg</code>' developers
need to know what they are.  In fact it is not recommended to do so.
</p><p>

If a developer were to explain someone how to build a Debian package, he
will certainly explain how to make a source package and how to build it.




</p><p>
On the other hand, not every developer wants to submit his software 
to Debian (yet), but still wants to profit from 
the advantages a packaging system like 'dpkg' offers without releasing
package source code. Personally I will release my freeware projects 
still as tar.gz files with source code etc. for all kind of platforms, 
while I plan to offer more and more '.deb' packages for the convenience 
of Debian users who just want to install and use my software.
</p><p>

If someone wants to do the next step to submit a software package to Debian,
you have to move on to study the Debian New Maintainers' Guide as well
as the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/" target="_top">Debian Policy Manual</a>
first. On your undertaking to create a Debian source package, also have 
a look at the 
<a class="ulink" href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/" target="_top">debian-mentors</a>
mailing list to see experienced and
beginning Debian developers interacting with each other and tackling similar
problem you might encounter.
