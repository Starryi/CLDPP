    laptop computer running Linux and I don't want to
    worry about someone reading the personal information it contains, in case
    it gets lost or stolen. My log on password may stop someone from booting
    it, but it won't prevent an attacker from removing the hard disk and
    reading its data. I need stronger protection.</p><p>Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use encryption so the hard
    disk data would be unreadable if it were to fall into the wrong hands.
    Encryption's not only useful for portable computers like laptops&#8212;it
    can be used to protect any computer with personal information. I protect
    my computer's files with encryption for the same reason I lock my
    filing cabinet at home. For further motivation, you may be interested in
    reading Michael Crawford's <a class="ulink" href="http://www.goingware.com/encryption/" target="_top">Why You Should Use Encryption</a>.</p><p>I could encrypt only certain files, such as those in my home
    directory. This would protect the files but then I'd have to worry
    about information leaking out of them to other, unencrypted places on the
    disk. Instead I encrypt the whole disk so I don't have to manage this
    problem.</p><p>There are many encryption algorithms to choose from. I chose <a class="ulink" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/" target="_top">AES</a> because it has
    been approved by the US government's <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nist.gov/" target="_top">National
    Institute of Standards and Technology</a> and is well regarded by the
    cryptography community. I want my use of it to be resistant to dictionary
    attacks, so I use a long, randomly generated key. There's no way
    I'm going to memorize such a key so I keep it in a form I can carry
    with me easily: on a USB flash drive on my keychain. I encrypt the key
    with a passphrase so my data is protected in two ways: by a) what I have
    (the USB flash drive) and b) what I know (the passphrase). I can even give
    a friend access to my computer without giving away my passphrase&#8212;she uses
    her own USB flash drive and her own passphrase.</p><p>The operating system keeps the data encrypted on the disk at all
    times and decrypts it in RAM only as it's used. This way if the
    computer loses power suddenly the data will remain protected. The
    decryption key is loaded into RAM at boot time and kept there while the
    computer is on, so I don't need to keep the USB flash drive plugged in
    after starting the computer.</p><p>The procedure outlined in this HOWTO is written for version 2.4 of
    the Linux kernel. It will become less complicated with the release of
    Linux 2.6, which will have built-in support for encryption and do a better
    job of managing partitions within loopback devices.</p><p>This document assumes the reader has a moderate level of experience
    with Linux (you should be comfortable <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">patching and
    compiling kernels</a> as well as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Multi-Disk-HOWTO.html" target="_top">partitioning,
    mounting, and unmounting disks</a>).</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="TechnicalSummary"></a>1.1. Technical Summary</h3></div></div></div><p>The encryption is implemented through a special kind of
      <em class="glossterm">loopback device</em>. A loopback device doesn't
      store any data itself; instead it takes all the data storage and
      retrieval requests it receives and passes them along to a real storage
      device, such as a disk or a file. As the data passes through, it can be
      filtered, and in our case the filter used is encryption.</p><p>When the system is deployed, a removable medium (USB flash drive)
      boots using GRUB, a kernel, and an initrd. Both the key and the kernel
      are selected from the GRUB menu, allowing a single removable medium to
      be used with multiple computers. The initrd contains just enough tools
      to ask for a passphrase, set up an encrypted loopback device, and mount
      it. After mounting, <code class="literal">pivot_root</code> is used to resume the
      boot process from the encrypted device. Loopback device offsets are
      used, instead of partitions, to access separate swap and root file
      system spaces within the encrypted loopback device because the 2.4
      kernel doesn't provide access to partitions within loopback devices.
      The offset method does not generalize to multiple partitions
      (unfortunately) because the maximum offset understood by
      <code class="literal">losetup</code> is 2GB.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="CopyrightAndLicense"></a>1.2. Copyright and License</h3></div></div></div><p>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this

      disk: encrypt the whole thing, a single partition, or a single file. I
      strongly recommend the first approach for best security. The first two
      approaches assume you'll be booting from removable media, such as a
      USB flash drive or a business card size CD-ROM. If you don't want to
      do this, you may modify the method to boot from the disk instead by
      making a small, unencrypted boot partition. If you want to use a USB
      flash drive to boot your computer, be sure your motherboard can do it
      first. At the time of this writing many cannot.</p><p>To avoid having to enumerate all three approaches everywhere
      I'm going to refer to what you're protecting as the
      <em class="glossterm">asset</em>. I will refer to the removable medium used
      to store the key as the <em class="glossterm">keychain</em>. I call it the
      keychain instead of the key because we can store lots of keys, each for
      different computers, on the same medium.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm102"></a>1.6.1. Whole Disk</h4></div></div></div><p>A problem with keeping data secret with encryption is that the
        data likes to move around. Imagine the encryption is like a fence
        around your data. While the data's inside the fence, it's
        safe. To be most useful, however, data likes to be transmitted on
        networks, put on removable disks like CD-ROMs, and shared with
        friends. Any time your data leaves the fenced area it's
        unprotected. We can't put an encryption fence around all possible
        locations where our data might play but we do want to make the fence
        as large as practical. By putting the encryption fence around your
        whole hard disk, you won't have to worry about data becoming
        unprotected if it jumps to another part of the disk.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>In this approach, we create one swap
        space and one root file system. Some people want more than a single
        encrypted partition for the root file system. Unfortunately, the
        method detailed here relies on the offset parameter of
        <code class="literal">losetup</code> to create "subpartitions" within
        the asset. The offset parameter is limited to a maximum value of 2GB,
        limiting the size of all but the last partition to 2GB. This works
        nicely for swap, which is already limited to 2GB on the i386
        architecture, but I'm guessing it won't be practical for other
        uses. Using it to create multiple partitions smaller than 2GB is left
        as an exercise for the reader.</p><p>Another way to handle multiple partitions is to encrypt each partition separately (using the same key) to avoid the technical limitation above.  This isn't secure as encrypting the whole disk because the partition table is exposed.  When an attacker attempts to break encryption, the first thing he does is try to figure out what it's encrypting.  A partition table listing Linux partitions is a big hint.  For this reason I discourage encrypting multiple partitions separately, but arguably it's a good compromise for getting around the current <code class="literal">losetup</code> limitation.  Another option is simply to wait for the release of Linux 2.6 because it is expected to make the offset parameter unnecessary.</p></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm110"></a>1.6.2. Partition (for multiboot systems)</h4></div></div></div><p>Encrypting the whole disk is fine if Linux is the only operating
        system on it, but this won't work for people who have set up their
        computer to boot multiple operating systems, e.g., <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kernel.org" target="_top">Linux</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.netbsd.org/" target="_top">NetBSD</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/" target="_top">Darwin</a>. In this case
        we can encrypt just the Linux partition and leave the others alone.
        Since we're booting from a removable medium, we won't even
        need to include the Linux partition in the multiboot menu with the
        others. To see why this isn't as secure as encrypting the whole
        disk, read <a class="xref" href="ar01s01.html#Attack_Tree" title="Table 1. Attack Tree">Table 1, &#8220;Attack Tree&#8221;</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm117"></a>1.6.3. File (for home directories)</h4></div></div></div><p>You may want to encrypt only a file on a file system. Once
        you've encrypted it you can put into it whatever you want,
        including other file systems. You might want to use this approach to
        encrypt only your home directory, for example. This is the least
        secure of the three approaches and not recommended. If you choose this
        approach you will notice instructions below to skip whole sections.
        This is because I'm assuming you've already booted an
        operating system and have your swap issues handled, so those sections
        don't apply to you. This HOWTO may be overkill for your needs and
        you can probably get away with just reading the fine
        <code class="literal"><a class="ulink" href="http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/loop-AES.README" target="_top">README</a></code>
        that comes with <a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/loop-aes/" target="_top">loop-AES</a>.
        If you do, be sure to read <a class="xref" href="ar01s01.html#ThreatModel" title="1.7. Threat Model">Section 1.7, &#8220;Threat Model&#8221;</a> before you
        finish here.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ThreatModel"></a>1.7. Threat Model</h3></div></div></div><p>In order to protect our asset well, we must first understand what
      we're protecting it against. The general idea is that you've got
      a laptop which is vulnerable to being stolen or lost, and have a USB
      flash drive on your keychain that isn't, so this system is designed
      to handle the case that your laptop is stolen. I'm guessing your
      keychain won't be as easily stolen because it's in your pocket,
      and because an attacker won't know that it's important. If you
      pull your USB flash drive out of your pocket and someone non-technical
      exclaims, "What's that?", tell them it's a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pez.com/" target="_top">Pez dispenser</a>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This system falls short when it comes to <em class="glossterm">plausible
        deniability</em>, which means there's no way to hide the
        fact that your personal data is encrypted. This is like locking your
        jewels in a safe and keeping the safe in plain sight in the middle of
        your living room. Only you can open the safe, but a man with a gun can
        tell you to open the safe for him. So if you're worried about your
        <a class="ulink" href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-11-502433.html?legacy=zdnn" target="_top">computer
        being subpoenaed</a> and being told to hand over your laptop,
        keychain, and passphrase, you'd better look at other solutions
        such as <a class="ulink" href="http://stegfs.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">StegFS</a>.</p><p>The following solution to the deniability problem has been suggested by Norris Pouhovitch.
        It should be possible to install a minimal Windows partition at the front
        of the disk and to encrypt the remainder.  When the computer
        is turned on without the keychain, it boots Windows normally.  When the
        keychain is booted, it skips the Windows partition, decrypts the remainder of
        the disk, and boots Linux.</p><p>The advantage of this scheme is that if the laptop is stolen and turned
        on, it will look like what a casual attacker is expecting to see (a Windows
        computer).  On the other hand, a serious attacker could notice the unusually
        small partition and become suspicious.  I will flesh out this idea further in
        a future version of the HOWTO.</p></div><div class="table"><a name="Attack_Tree"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Attack Tree</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" summary="Attack Tree" border="1"><colgroup><col class="A1"><col class="A2"><col class="A3"><col class="A4"><col align="center"><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="4" align="center">Attack</th><th align="center">Reaction</th><th align="center">Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="middle"><td rowspan="4" valign="middle">attacker steals laptop</td><td colspan="3" valign="middle">while it is on</td><td align="center" valign="middle"><a class="glossterm" href="ar01s01.html#SOL"><em class="glossterm"><a class="glossterm" href="ar01s01.html#SOL" title="SOL">SOL</a></em></a></td><td valign="middle">The asset is unprotected while the computer is running because the encryption key is in RAM.

When I bought mine, I
        found one which fit the following requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>physically small (I carry it on my physical keychain)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>supports USB 2.0 at full speed</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>has a write-protect switch, so I don't clobber my
            encryption keys by accident</p></li></ul></div><p>You might be tempted to get one with a fingerprint reader. I
        strongly encourage you not to. It might initially seem like a good
        idea, because by adding the biometric, your security protection
        expands to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>something you have (the USB flash drive)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>something you know (the passphrase)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>something you are (your fingerprint, or whatever)</p></li></ul></div><p>However, suppose something goes wrong. If you are now asking
        yourself, "What could go wrong?", then why are you reading
        this HOWTO? If something goes wrong, you make a change (see <a class="xref" href="ar01s01.html#reactions">Corrective Reactions</a>):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Change what you have by using a different USB flash drive.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change what you know by learning a new passphrase.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>You can't change what you are.</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>Stop and ponder that last line for a while.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="LookingToTheFuture"></a>1.10. Looking to the Future</h3></div></div></div><p>I wrote this document while using the 2.4 kernel.  Linux 2.6 introduces the <a class="ulink" href="http://sources.redhat.com/dm/" target="_top">Device-mapper</a> which we will be able to use to avoid playing games with
losetup offsets.  Linux 2.6 also introduces <a class="ulink" href="http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/" target="_top">dm-crypt</a>, an
encryption layer for the Device-mapper which looks quite elegant.  Unfortunately, <a class="ulink" href="http://mareichelt.de/pub/texts.cryptoloop.php" target="_top">it's not safe!</a>  Hopefully someday
it will be fixed, but in the mean time the best course is to stick with loop-AES.</p><p>A future version of this HOWTO will explain how to use the Device-mapper with Linux 2.6.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Disk Encryption HOWTO </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 2. Procedure</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
