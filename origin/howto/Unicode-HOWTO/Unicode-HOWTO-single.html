as text encoding. -
This is work in progress. Any tips, patches, pointers, URLs are very welcome.</EM>

<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why Unicode?</A>
</H2>


<P>People in different countries use different characters to represent the
words of their native languages. Nowadays most applications, including
email systems and web browsers, are 8-bit clean, i.e. they can operate on
and display text correctly provided that it is represented in an 8-bit
character set, like ISO-8859-1.</P>
<P>There are far more than 256 characters in the world - think of cyrillic,
hebrew, arabic, chinese, japanese, korean and thai -, and new characters
are being invented now and then. The problems that come up for users are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It is impossible to store text with characters from different character
sets in the same document. For example, I can cite russian papers in
a German or French publication if I use TeX, xdvi and PostScript,
but I cannot do it in plain text.</LI>
<LI>As long as every document has its own character set, and recognition
of the character set is not automatic, manual user intervention is
inevitable. For example, in order to view the homepage of the
XTeamLinux distribution
<A HREF="http://www.xteamlinux.com.cn/">http://www.xteamlinux.com.cn/</A>
I had to tell Netscape that the web page is coded in GB2312.</LI>
<LI>New symbols like the Euro are being invented. ISO has issued a new
standard ISO-8859-15, which is mostly like ISO-8859-1 except that it
removes some rarely used characters (the old currency sign) and
replaced it with the Euro sign. If users adopt this standard, they
have documents in different character sets on their disk, and they
start having to think about it daily. But computers should make things
simpler, not more complicated.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The solution of this problem is the adoption of a world-wide usable character
set. This character set is Unicode
<A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/">http://www.unicode.org/</A>.
For more info about Unicode, do `<CODE>man 7 unicode</CODE>' (manpage contained
in the man-pages-1.20 package).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Unicode encodings</A>
</H2>


<P>This reduces the user's problem of dealing with character sets to a technical
problem: How to transport Unicode characters using the 8-bit bytes?
8-bit units are the smallest addressing units of most computers and also the
unit used by TCP/IP network connections. The use of 1 byte to represent
1 character is, however, an accident of history, caused by the fact that
computer development started in Europe and the U.S. where 96 characters were
found to be sufficient for a long time.</P>
<P>There are basically four ways to encode Unicode characters in bytes:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>UTF-8</B><DD>
<P>128 characters are encoded using 1 byte (the ASCII characters).
1920 characters are encoded using 2 bytes (Roman, Greek, Cyrillic,
Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic characters).
63488 characters are encoded using 3 bytes (Chinese and Japanese among
others).
The other 2147418112 characters (not assigned yet) can be encoded
using 4, 5 or 6 characters.
For more info about UTF-8, do `<CODE>man 7 utf-8</CODE>' (manpage contained
in the man-pages-1.20 package).</P>
<DT><B>UCS-2</B><DD>
<P>Every character is represented as two bytes.
This encoding can only represent the first 65536 Unicode characters.</P>
<DT><B>UTF-16</B><DD>
<P>This is an extension of UCS-2 which can represent 1112064 Unicode
characters. The first 65536 Unicode characters are represented as two
bytes, the other ones as four bytes.</P>
<DT><B>UCS-4</B><DD>
<P>Every character is represented as four bytes.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>The space requirements for encoding a text, compared to encodings currently
in use (8 bit per character for European languages, more for
Chinese/Japanese/Korean), is as follows. This has an influence on disk
storage space and network download speed (when no form of compression is
used).</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>UTF-8</B><DD>
<P>No change for US ASCII, just a few percent more for ISO-8859-1,
50% more for Chinese/Japanese/Korean, 100% more for Greek and Cyrillic.</P>
<DT><B>UCS-2 and UTF-16</B><DD>
<P>No change for Chinese/Japanese/Korean. 100% more for
US ASCII and ISO-8859-1, Greek and Cyrillic.</P>
<DT><B>UCS-4</B><DD>
<P>100% more for Chinese/Japanese/Korean. 300% more for US ASCII and
ISO-8859-1, Greek and Cyrillic.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Given the penalty for US and European documents caused by UCS-2, UTF-16, and
UCS-4, it seems unlikely that these encodings have a potential for wide-scale
use. The Microsoft Win32 API supports the UCS-2 encoding since 1995 (at
least), yet this encoding has not been widely adopted for documents - SJIS
remains prevalent in Japan.</P>
<P>UTF-8 on the other hand has the potential for wide-scale use, since it
doesn't penalize US and European users, and since many text processing
programs don't need to be changed for UTF-8 support.</P>
<P>In the following, we will describe how to change your Linux system so
it uses UTF-8 as text encoding.</P>

<H3>Footnotes for C/C++ developers</H3>


<P>The Microsoft Win32 approach makes it easy for developers to produce
Unicode versions of their programs: You "#define UNICODE" at the top
of your program and then change many occurrences of `<CODE>char</CODE>' to
`<CODE>TCHAR</CODE>', until your program compiles without warnings. The problem
with it is that you end up with two versions of your program: one which
understands UCS-2 text but no 8-bit encodings, and one which understands
only old 8-bit encodings.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is an endianness issue with UCS-2 and UCS-4. The IANA
character set registry
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets">http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets</A>
says about ISO-10646-UCS-2: "this needs to specify network byte order: the
standard does not specify". Network byte order is big endian. And RFC 2152
is even clearer: "ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993(E) specifies that when characters the
UCS-2 form are serialized as octets, that the most significant octet appear
first."
Whereas Microsoft, in its C/C++ development tools, recommends
to use machine-dependent endianness (i.e. little endian on ix86 processors)
and either a byte-order mark at the beginning of the document, or some
statistical heuristics(!).</P>
<P>The UTF-8 approach on the other hand keeps `<CODE>char*</CODE>' as the standard C
string type. As a result, your program will handle US ASCII text,
independently of any environment variables, and will handle both
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 encoded text provided the LANG environment variable
is set accordingly.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Display setup</A></H2>


<P>We assume you have already adapted your Linux console and X11 configuration
to your keyboard and locale. This is explained in the Danish/International
HOWTO, and in the other national HOWTOs: Finnish, French, German, Italian,
Polish, Slovenian, Spanish, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Chinese, Thai, Esperanto. But
please do not follow the advice given in the Thai HOWTO, to pretend you
were using ISO-8859-1 characters (U0000..U00FF) when what you are typing
are actually Thai characters (U0E01..U0E5B). Doing so will only cause
problems when you switch to Unicode.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Linux console</A>
</H2>


<P>I'm not talking much about the Linux console here, because on those machines
on which I don't have xdm running, I use it only to type my login name,
my password, and "xinit".</P>
<P>Anyway, the kbd-0.99 package
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/kbd-0.99.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/kbd-0.99.tar.gz</A>
and a heavily extended version, the console-tools-0.2.3 package
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/console-tools-0.2.3.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/console-tools-0.2.3.tar.gz</A>
contains in the kbd-0.99/src/ (or console-tools-0.2.3/screenfonttools/)
directory two programs: `unicode_start' and `unicode_stop'. When you call
`unicode_start', the console's screen output is interpreted as UTF-8. Also,
the keyboard is put into Unicode mode (see "man kbd_mode"). In this mode,
Unicode characters typed as Alt-x1 ... Alt-xn (where x1,...,xn are digits on
the numeric keypad) will be emitted in UTF-8. If your keyboard or, more
precisely, your normal keymap has non-ASCII letter keys (like the German
Umlaute) which you would like to be CapsLockable, you need to apply the kernel
patch
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/linux-2.2.9-keyboard.diff">linux-2.2.9-keyboard.diff</A>
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/linux-2.3.12-keyboard.diff">linux-2.3.12-keyboard.diff</A>.</P>
<P>You will want to use display characters from different scripts on the same
screen. For this, you need a Unicode console font. The
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/kbd-0.99.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/kbd-0.99.tar.gz</A>
and
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/console-data-1999.08.29.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/console-data-1999.08.29.tar.gz</A>
packages contain a font (LatArCyrHeb-{08,14,16,19}.psf) which
covers Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic scripts. It covers ISO 8859 parts
1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10 all at once. To install it, copy it to
/usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/ and execute
"/usr/bin/setfont /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/LatArCyrHeb-14.psf".</P>
<P>A more flexible approach is given by Dmitry Yu. Bolkhovityanov
<A HREF="mailto:D.Yu.Bolkhovityanov@inp.nsk.su">&lt;D.Yu.Bolkhovityanov@inp.nsk.su&gt;</A>
in 
<A HREF="http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/index.html">http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/index.html</A>
and 
<A HREF="http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/uni-vga.tgz">http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/univga/uni-vga.tgz</A>.
To work around the constraint that a VGA font can only cover 512 characters simultaneously,
he provides a rich Unicode font (2279 characters, covering Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew,
Armenian, IPA, math symbols, arrows, and more) in the typical 8x16 size and a script
which permits to extract any 512 characters as a console font.</P>
<P>If you want cut&amp;paste to work with UTF-8 consoles, you need the patch
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/linux-2.3.12-console.diff">linux-2.3.12-console.diff</A>
from Edmund Thomas Grimley Evans and Stanislav Voronyi.</P>
<P>In April 2000, Edmund Thomas Grimley Evans
<A HREF="mailto:edmundo@rano.org">&lt;edmundo@rano.org&gt;</A>
has implemented an UTF-8 console terminal emulator. It uses Unicode fonts
and relies on the Linux frame buffer device.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 X11 Foreign fonts</A>
</H2>


<P>Don't hesitate to install Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese etc. fonts. Even
if they are not Unicode fonts, they will help in displaying Unicode
documents: at least Netscape Communicator 4 and Java will make use of
foreign fonts when available.</P>
<P>The following programs are useful when installing fonts:
<UL>
<LI>"mkfontdir directory"
prepares a font directory for use by the X server, needs to be executed
after installing fonts in a directory.</LI>
<LI>"xset -q | sed -e '1,/^Font Path:/d' | sed -e '2,$d' -e 's/^  //'"
displays the X server's current font path.</LI>
<LI>"xset fp+ directory"
adds a directory to the X server's current font path.
To add a directory permanently, add a "FontPath" line to your
/etc/XF86Config file, in section "Files".</LI>
<LI>"xset fp rehash"
needs to be executed after calling mkfontdir on a directory that is
already contained in the X server's current font path.</LI>
<LI>"xfontsel"
allows you to browse the installed fonts by selecting various font
properties.</LI>
<LI>"xlsfonts -fn fontpattern"
lists all fonts matching a font pattern. Also displays various font
properties. In particular, "xlsfonts -ll -fn font" lists the font
properties CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING, which together
determine the font's encoding.</LI>
<LI>"xfd -fn font"
displays a font page by page.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The following fonts are freely available (not a complete list):
<UL>
<LI>The ones contained in XFree86, sometimes packaged in separate packages.
For example, SuSE has only normal 75dpi fonts in the base `xf86' package.
The other fonts are in the packages `xfnt100', `xfntbig', `xfntcyr',
`xfntscl'.</LI>
<LI>The Emacs international fonts,
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/intlfonts/intlfonts-1.2.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/intlfonts/intlfonts-1.2.tar.gz</A>
As already mentioned, they are useful even if you prefer XEmacs to
GNU Emacs or don't use any Emacs at all.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 X11 Unicode fonts</A>
</H2>


<P>Applications wishing to display text belonging to different scripts (like
Cyrillic and Greek) at the same time, can do so by using different X fonts
for the various pieces of text. This is what Netscape Communicator and Java
do. However, this approach is more complicated, because instead of working
with `Font' and `XFontStruct', the programmer has to deal with `XFontSet',
and also because not all fonts in the font set need to have the same
dimensions.</P>

<LI>Markus Kuhn has assembled fixed-width 75dpi fonts with Unicode encoding
covering Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Georgian, Hebrew scripts and
many symbols.
They cover ISO 8859 parts 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,16 all at once.
These fonts are required for running xterm in utf-8 mode. They are now
contained in XFree86 4.0.1, therefore you need to install them manually
only if you have an older XFree86 3.x version.

Dickey.
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/dickey/xterm/xterm.html">http://www.clark.net/pub/dickey/xterm/xterm.html</A>
Newer versions (patch level 146 and above) contain support for converting
keystrokes to UTF-8 before sending them to the application running in the
xterm, and for displaying Unicode characters that the application outputs
as UTF-8 byte sequence. It also contains support for double-wide characters
(mostly CJK ideographs) and combining characters, contributed by Robert Brady
<A HREF="mailto:robert@suse.co.uk">&lt;robert@suse.co.uk&gt;</A>.</P>

<LI>Start "xterm -u8 -fn '-misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1'".

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Files &amp; the kernel</A>
</H2>


<P>You can now already use any Unicode characters in file names. No kernel
or file utilities need modifications. This is because file names in the
kernel can be anything not containing a null byte, and '/' is used to
delimit subdirectories. When encoded using UTF-8, non-ASCII characters
will never be encoded using null bytes or slashes. All that happens is
that file and directory names occupy more bytes than they contain characters.
For example, a filename consisting of five greek characters will appear
to the kernel as a 10-byte filename. The kernel does not know (and does
not need to know) that these bytes are displayed as greek.</P>
<P>This is the general theory, as long as your files stay inside Linux. On
filesystems which are used from other operating systems, you have mount
options to control conversion of filenames to/from UTF-8:
<UL>
<LI>The "vfat" filesystems has a mount option "utf8".
See 
<A HREF="file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt">file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/vfat.txt</A>.
When you give an "iocharset" mount option different from the default
(which is "iso8859-1"), the results with and without "utf8" are not
consistent. Therefore I don't recommend the "iocharset" mount option.</LI>
<LI>The "msdos", "umsdos" filesystems have the same mount option, but it
appears to have no effect.</LI>
<LI>The "iso9660" filesystem has a mount option "utf8".
See 
<A HREF="file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/isofs.txt">file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/isofs.txt</A>.</LI>
<LI>Since Linux 2.2.x kernels, the "ntfs" filesystem has a mount option
"utf8". See
<A HREF="file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt">file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt</A>.</LI>
</UL>

The other filesystems (nfs, smbfs, ncpfs, hpfs, etc.) don't convert
filenames; therefore they support Unicode file names in UTF-8 encoding only
if the other operating system supports them.
Recall that to enable a mount option for all future remounts, you add it to
the fourth column of the corresponding /etc/fstab line.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Upgrading the C library</A>
</H2>


<P>glibc-2.2 supports multibyte locales, in particular UTF-8 locales. But
glibc-2.1.x and earlier C libraries do not support it. Therefore you need
to upgrade to glibc-2.2. Upgrading from glibc-2.1.x is riskless, because
glibc-2.2 is binary compatible with glibc-2.1.x (at least on i386 platforms,
and except for IPv6). Nevertheless, I recommend to have a bootable rescue
disk handy in case something goes wrong.</P>
<P>Prepare the kernel sources. You must have them unpacked and configured.
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/autoconf.h must exist. Building the kernel
is not needed.</P>
<P>Retrieve the glibc sources
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc/</A>,

<P>Upgrading from glibc versions earlier than 2.1.x cannot be done this way;
consider first installing a Linux distribution based on glibc-2.1.x, and
then upgrading to glibc-2.2 as described above.</P>
<P>Note that if -- for any reason -- you want to rebuild GCC after having

<P>You will need a program to convert your locally (probably ISO-8859-1) encoded

<P>default value for all LC_* variables</P>
</DL>

(See `<CODE>man 7 locale</CODE>' for a detailed description.)</P>
<P>Each of the LC_* and LANG variables can contain a locale name of the
following form:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</P>
<P>where language is an

language code (lower case), territory is an
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/ISO_3166.html">ISO 3166</A>
country code (upper case), codeset denotes a character set, and
modifier stands for other particular attributes (for example indicating
a particular language dialect, or a nonstandard orthography).</P>
<P>LANGUAGE can contain several locale names, separated by colons.</P>
<P>In order to tell your system and all applications that you are using UTF-8,
you need to add a codeset suffix of UTF-8 to your locale names. For example,
if you were using
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

In lynx-2.8.2 you can alternatively, in the options screen (key 'O'),

<H3>yudit</H3>


<P>yudit by G&aacute;sp&aacute;r Sinai
<A HREF="http://www.yudit.org/">http://www.yudit.org/</A>
is a first-class unicode text editor for the X Window System.
It supports simultaneous processing of many languages, input methods,
conversions for local character standards.
It has facilities for entering text in all languages with only
an English keyboard, using keyboard configuration maps.</P>

<H3>yudit-1.5</H3>


<P>It can be compiled in three versions: Xlib GUI, KDE GUI, or Motif GUI.</P>
<P>Customization is very easy. Typically you will first customize your font.
From the font menu I chose "Unicode". Then, since the command
"xlsfonts '*-*-iso10646-1'" still showed some ambiguity, I chose a font
size of 13 (to match Markus Kuhn's 13-pixel fixed font).</P>
<P>Next, you will customize your input method. The input methods "Straight",
"Unicode" and "SGML" are most remarkable. For details about the other
built-in input methods, look in /usr/local/share/yudit/data/.</P>
<P>To change the default for the next session, edit your $HOME/.yuditrc
file.</P>
<P>The general editor functionality is limited to editing, cut&amp;paste
and search&amp;replace. No undo.</P>

<H3>yudit-2.1</H3>


<P>This version is less easy to learn, because it comes with a homebrewn
GUI and no easily accessible help. But it has an undo functionality and
should therefore be more usable than version 1.5.</P>

<H3>Fonts for yudit</H3>


<P>yudit can display text using a TrueType font; see section "TrueType fonts"
above. The Bitstream Cyberbit gives good results. For yudit to find the
font, symlink it to <CODE>/usr/local/share/yudit/data/cyberbit.ttf</CODE>.</P>

<H3>vim</H3>


<P>vim (as of version 6.0r) has good support for UTF-8: when started in an
UTF-8 locale, it assumes UTF-8 encoding for the console and the text files
being edited. It supports double-wide (CJK) characters as well and
combining characters and therefore fits perfectly into UTF-8 enabled
xterm.</P>
<P>Installation: Download from
<A HREF="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</A>.
After unpacking the four parts, call <CODE>./configure</CODE> with
<CODE>--with-features=big</CODE> <CODE>--enable-multibyte</CODE> arguments
(or edit src/Makefile to include the <CODE>--with-features=big</CODE> and
<CODE>--enable-multibyte</CODE> options). This will turn on the feature
FEAT_MBYTE. Then do "make" and "make install".</P>
<P>vim can be used to edit files in other encodings. For example, to edit
a BIG5 encoded file: <CODE>:e ++cc=BIG5 filename</CODE>. All encoding names
supported by iconv are accepted. Plus: vim automatically distinguishes
UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 files without needing any command line option.</P>

<H3>cooledit</H3>


<P>cooledit by Paul Sheer
<A HREF="http://www.cooledit.org/">http://www.cooledit.org/</A>
is a good text editor for the X Window System. Since version 3.15, it has
support for Unicode, including Bidi for Hebrew (but not Arabic).</P>
<P>A build error message message about a missing "vga_setpage" function is
worked around by adding "-DDO_NOT_USE_VGALIB" to the CFLAGS.</P>
<P>To view UTF-8 files in an UTF-8 locale you have to modify a setting in
the "Options -> Switches" panel: Enable the checkbox "Display characters
outside locale". I also found it necessary to disable "Spellcheck as you
type".</P>
<P>For viewing texts with both European and CJK characters, cooledit needs a
font which contains both, for example the GNU unifont (see section
"X11 Unicode fonts"): Start once
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cooledit -fn -gnu-unifont-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

cooledit will then use this font in all future invocations.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the only characters that can be entered through the keyboard
are ISO-8859-1 characters and, through a cooledit specific compose mechanism,
ISO-8859-2 characters. Inputing arbitrary Unicode characters in cooledit is
possible, but a bit tedious.</P>

<H3>emacs</H3>


<P>First of all, you should read the section "International Character Set Support"
(node "International") in the Emacs manual. In particular, note that you need
to start Emacs using the command
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emacs -fn fontset-standard
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

so that it will use a font set comprising a lot of international characters.</P>

of them needs recompiling Emacs.

</P>
<P>You can use either of these packages, or both together. The advantages
of the emacs-utf "unicode-utf8" encoding are: it loads faster, and it deals
better with combining characters (important for Thai).
The advantage of the Mule-UCS / oc-unicode "utf-8" encoding is: it can apply
to a process buffer (such as M-x shell), not only to loading and saving of
files; and it respects the widths of characters better (important for
Ethiopian). However, it is less reliable: After heavy editing of a file, I
have seen some Unicode characters replaced with U+FFFD after the file was
saved. (But maybe that were bugs in Emacs 20.5 and 20.6 which are fixed in
Emacs 20.7.)</P>

(This works with oc-unicode/Mule-UCS only.)</P>
<P>There is a newer version Mule-UCS-0.81. Unfortunately you need to rebuild emacs

<P>Note that all this works with Emacs 20 in windowing mode only, not in terminal

<P>Richard Stallman plans to add integrated UTF-8 support to Emacs in the long
term, and so does the XEmacs developers group.</P>

<H3>xemacs</H3>


<P>(This section is written by Gilbert Baumann.)</P>
<P>Here is how to teach XEmacs (20.4 configured with MULE) the UTF-8 encoding.
Unfortunately you need its sources to be able to patch it.</P>
<P>First you need these files provided by Tomohiko Morioka:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-21.0-b55-emc-b55-ucs.diff">http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-21.0-b55-emc-b55-ucs.diff</A>
and
<A HREF="http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-ucs-conv-0.1.tar.gz">http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-ucs-conv-0.1.tar.gz</A></P>
<P>The .diff is a diff against the C sources. The tar ball is elisp code, 
which provides lots of code tables to map to and from Unicode. As the
name of the diff file suggests it is against XEmacs-21; I needed to
help `patch' a bit. The most notable difference to my XEmacs-20.4
sources is that file-coding.[ch] was called mule-coding.[ch].</P>
<P>For those unfamilar with the XEmacs-MULE stuff (as I am) a quick
guide:</P>
<P>What we call an encoding is called by MULE a `coding-system'. The most
important commands are:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
M-x set-file-coding-system
M-x set-buffer-process-coding-system   [comint buffers]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and the variable `file-coding-system-alist', which guides `find-file'
to guess the encoding used. After stuff was running, the very first
thing I did was 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/gb-hacks.el">this</A>.</P>
<P>This code looks into the special mode line introduced by -*- somewhere
in the first 600 bytes of the file about to opened; if now there is a
field "Encoding: xyz;" and the xyz encoding ("coding system" in Emacs speak)
exists, choose that. So now you could do e.g.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
;;; -*- Mode: Lisp; Syntax: Common-Lisp; Package: CLEX; Encoding: utf-8; -*-
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and XEmacs goes into utf-8 mode here.</P>
<P>Atfer everything was running I defined \u03BB (greek lambda) as a
macro like:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

(defmacro \u03BB (x) `(lambda .,x))

<H3>xedit</H3>


<P>With XFree86-4.0.1, xedit is able to edit UTF-8 files if you set the locale
accordingly (see above), and add the line "Xedit*international: true" to
your $HOME/.Xdefaults file.</P>

<H3>axe</H3>


<P>As of version 6.1.2, aXe supports only 8-bit locales. If you add the line
"Axe*international: true" to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, it will simply dump
core.</P>

<H3>pico</H3>


<P>As of version 4.30, pine cannot be reasonably used to view or edit UTF-8
files. In UTF-8 enabled xterm, it has severe redraw problems.</P>

<H3>mined98</H3>


<P>mined98 is a small text editor by Michiel Huisjes, Achim M&uuml;ller and
Thomas Wolff.
<A HREF="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~wolff/mined98.tar.gz">http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~wolff/mined98.tar.gz</A>
It lets you edit UTF-8 or 8-bit encoded files, in an UTF-8 or 8-bit xterm.
It also has powerful capabilities for entering Unicode characters.</P>
<P>mined lets you edit both 8-bit encoded and UTF-8 encoded files. By default
it uses an autodetection heuristic. If you don't want to rely on heuristics,
pass the command-line option <CODE>-u</CODE> when editing an UTF-8 file, or
<CODE>+u</CODE> when editing an 8-bit encoded file. You can change the
interpretation at any time from within the editor: It displays the encoding
("L:h" for 8-bit, "U:h" for UTF-8) in the menu line. Click on the first
of these characters to change it.</P>
<P>mined knows about double-width and combining characters and displays them
correctly. It also has a special display mode for combining characters.</P>
<P>mined also has a scrollbar and very nice pull-down menus. Alas, the "Home",
"End", "Delete" keys do not work.</P>

<H3>qemacs</H3>


<P>qemacs 0.2 is a small text editor by Fabrice Bellard.
<A HREF="http://www-stud.enst.fr/~bellard/qemacs/">http://www-stud.enst.fr/~bellard/qemacs/</A>
with Emacs keybindings. It runs in an UTF-8 console or xterm, and can edit
both 8-bit encoded and UTF-8 encoded files. It still has a few rough edges,
but further development is underway.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Mailers</A>
</H2>


<P>MIME: RFC 2279 defines UTF-8 as a MIME charset, which can be transported
under the 8bit, quoted-printable and base64 encodings. The older MIME
UTF-7 proposal (RFC 2152) is considered to be deprecated and should not
be used any further.</P>
<P>Mail clients released after January 1, 1999, should be capable of sending and
displaying UTF-8 encoded mails, otherwise they are considered deficient.
But these mails have to carry the MIME labels
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Simply piping an UTF-8 file into "mail" without caring about the MIME labels
will not work.</P>
<P>Mail client implementors should take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.imc.org/imc-intl/">http://www.imc.org/imc-intl/</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.imc.org/mail-i18n.html">http://www.imc.org/mail-i18n.html</A>.</P>
<P>Now about the individual mail clients (or "mail user agents"):</P>

<H3>pine</H3>


<P>The situation for an unpatched pine version 4.30 is as follows.</P>
<P>Pine does not do character set conversions. But it allows you to view
UTF-8 mails in an UTF-8 text window (Linux console or xterm).</P>
<P>Normally, Pine will warn about different character sets each time you view
an UTF-8 encoded mail. To get rid of this warning, choose S (setup), then
C (config), then change the value of "character-set" to UTF-8. This option
will not do anything, except to reduce the warnings, as Pine has no built-in
knowledge of UTF-8.</P>
<P>Also note that Pine's notion of Unicode characters is pretty limited: It
will display Latin and Greek characters, but not other kinds of Unicode
characters.</P>
<P>A patch by Robert Brady
<A HREF="mailto:robert@suse.co.uk">&lt;robert@suse.co.uk&gt;</A>
<A HREF="http://www.ents.susu.soton.ac.uk/~robert/pine-utf8-0.1.diff">http://www.ents.susu.soton.ac.uk/~robert/pine-utf8-0.1.diff</A>
adds UTF-8 support to Pine. With this patch, it decodes and prints headers
and bodies properly. The patch depends on the GNOME libunicode
<A HREF="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libunicode/">http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libunicode/</A>.</P>
<P>However, alignment remains broken in many places; replying to a mail does
not cause the character set to be converted as appropriate; and the editor,
pico, cannot deal with multibyte characters.</P>

<H3>kmail</H3>


<P>kmail (as of KDE 1.0) does not support UTF-8 mails at all.</P>

<H3>Netscape Communicator</H3>


<P>Netscape Communicator's Messenger can send and display mails in UTF-8
encoding, but it needs a little bit of manual user intervention.</P>
<P>To send an UTF-8 encoded mail: After opening the "Compose" window, but before
starting to compose the message, select from the menu
"View -> Character Set -> Unicode (UTF-8)". Then compose the message and
send it.</P>
<P>When you receive an UTF-8 encoded mail, Netscape unfortunately does not
display it in UTF-8 right away, and does not even give a visual clue that
the mail was encoded in UTF-8. You have to manually select from the menu
"View -> Character Set -> Unicode (UTF-8)".</P>
<P>For displaying UTF-8 mails, Netscape uses different fonts. You can adjust
your font settings in the "Edit -> Preferences -> Fonts" dialog; choose
the "Unicode" font category.</P>

<H3>mutt</H3>


<P>mutt-1.2.x, as available from
<A HREF="http://www.mutt.org/">http://www.mutt.org/</A>,
has only rudimentary support for UTF-8: it can convert
from UTF-8 into an 8-bit display charset. The mutt-1.3.x
development branch also supports UTF-8 as the display charset,
so you can run Mutt in an UTF-8 xterm, and has thorough support
for MIME and charset conversion (relying on iconv).</P>

<H3>exmh</H3>

<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Printing</A></H2>


<P>Since Postscript itself does not support Unicode fonts, the burden of
Unicode support in printing is on the program creating the Postscript
document, not on the Postscript renderer.</P>
<P>The existing Postscript fonts I've seen - .pfa/.pfb/.afm/.pfm/.gsf -
support only a small range of glyphs and are not Unicode fonts.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Printing using TrueType fonts</A>
</H2>


<P>Both the uniprint and wprint programs produce good printed output
for Unicode plain text. They require a TrueType font; see section
"TrueType fonts" above. The Bitstream Cyberbit gives good results.</P>

<H3>uniprint</H3>


<P>The "uniprint" program contained in the yudit package can convert a text
file to Postscript. For uniprint to find the Cyberbit font, symlink it to
<CODE>/usr/local/share/yudit/data/cyberbit.ttf</CODE>.</P>

<H3>wprint</H3>


<P>The "wprint" (WorldPrint) program by Eduardo Trapani
<A HREF="http://ttt.esperanto.org.uy/programoj/angle/wprint.html">http://ttt.esperanto.org.uy/programoj/angle/wprint.html</A>
postprocesses Postscript output produced by Netscape Communicator or Mozilla
from HTML pages or plain text files.</P>
<P>The output is nearly perfect; only in Cyrillic paragraphs the line breaking
is incorrect: the lines are only about half as wide as they should be.</P>

<H3>Comparison</H3>


<P>For plain text, uniprint has a better overall layout. On the other hand,
only wprint gets Thai output correct.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Printing using fixed-size fonts</A>

<A HREF="http://members.linuxstart.com/~winitzki/txtbdf2ps.html">http://members.linuxstart.com/~winitzki/txtbdf2ps.html</A>
converts a plain text file to Postscript, by use of a BDF font.
Installation:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# install -m 777 txtbdf2ps-dev.txt /usr/local/bin/txtbdf2ps
</PRE>

Example with a proportional font:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ txtbdf2ps -BDF=cyberbit.bdf -UTF-8 -nowrap &lt; input.txt > output.ps
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Example with a fixed-width font:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ txtbdf2ps -BDF=unifont.bdf -UTF-8 -nowrap &lt; input.txt > output.ps
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note: txtbdf2ps does not support combining characters and bidi.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 The classical approach</A>
</H2>


<P>Another way to print with TrueType fonts is to convert the TrueType font to
a Postscript font using the <CODE>ttf2pt1</CODE> utility
(

<H3>html2ps</H3>


<P>As of version 1.0b1, the html2ps HTML to Postscript converter does not support
UTF-8 encoded HTML pages and has no special treatment of fonts: the generated
Postscript uses the standard Postscript fonts.</P>

<H3>enscript</H3>

<P>The C `<CODE>char</CODE>' type is 8-bit and will stay 8-bit because it denotes

<H3>For normal text handling</H3>


<P>The ISO/ANSI C standard contains, in an amendment which was added in 1995,
a "wide character" type `<CODE>wchar_t</CODE>', a set of functions like those

<P>Advantages of using this API:
<UL>
<LI>It's a vendor independent standard.</LI>
<LI>The functions do the right thing, depending on the user's locale.
All a program needs to call is <CODE>setlocale(LC_ALL,"");</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Drawbacks of this API:
<UL>
<LI>Some of the functions are not multithread-safe, because they keep a hidden
internal state between function calls.</LI>
<LI>There is no first-class locale datatype. Therefore this API cannot reasonably
be used for anything that needs more than one locale or character set at the
same time.</LI>
<LI>The OS support for this API is not good on most OSes.</LI>

<H3>Portability notes</H3>


<P>A `<CODE>wchar_t</CODE>' may or may not be encoded in Unicode; this is
platform and sometimes also locale dependent. A multibyte sequence
`<CODE>char *</CODE>' may or may not be encoded in UTF-8; this is platform
and sometimes also locale dependent.</P>
<P>In detail, here is what the
<A HREF="http://www.UNIX-systems.org/online.html">Single Unix specification</A>
says about the `<CODE>wchar_t</CODE>' type:
<EM>All wide-character codes in a given process consist of an equal number
of bits. This is in contrast to characters, which can consist of a
variable number of bytes. The byte or byte sequence that represents a 
character can also be represented as a wide-character code.  
Wide-character codes thus provide a uniform size for manipulating text
data. A wide-character code having all bits zero is the null
wide-character code, and terminates wide-character strings. The
wide-character value for each member of the Portable Character Set</EM> (i.e. ASCII) <EM>will equal its value when used as the lone character in an integer
character constant. Wide-character codes for other characters are
locale- and implementation-dependent. State shift bytes do not have a
wide-character code representation.</EM></P>
<P>One particular consequence is that in portable programs you shouldn't use
non-ASCII characters in string literals. That means, even though you
know the Unicode double quotation marks have the codes U+201C and U+201D,
you shouldn't write a string literal <CODE>L"\u201cHello\u201d, he said"</CODE>
or <CODE>"\xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\x9d, he said"</CODE> in C programs. Instead,
use GNU gettext, write it as <CODE>gettext("'Hello', he said")</CODE>, and create
a message database en.po which translates "'Hello', he said" to
"\u201cHello\u201d, he said".</P>

Unix flavours.</P>

<P>As a consequence, I recommend to use the restartable and multithread-safe

wcsr/mbsr functions (Linux, Solaris, OSF/1).</P>
<P>A similar advice, given by Sun in
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/software/white-papers/wp-unicode/">http://www.sun.com/software/white-papers/wp-unicode/</A>,
section "Internationalized Applications with Unicode", is:</P>
<P><EM>To properly internationalize an application, use the following
guidelines:</EM>
<OL>
<LI><EM>Avoid direct access with Unicode. This is a task of the platform's
internationalization framework.</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Use the POSIX model for multibyte and wide-character interfaces.</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Only call the APIs that the internationalization framework
provides for language and cultural-specific operations.</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Remain code-set independent.</EM></LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>If, for some reason, in some piece of code, you really have to assume that
`wchar_t' is Unicode (for example, if you want to do special treatment of
some Unicode characters), you should make that piece of code conditional
upon the result of <CODE>is_locale_utf8()</CODE>. Otherwise you will mess up
your program's behaviour in different locales or other platforms. The
function <CODE>is_locale_utf8</CODE> is declared in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/utf8locale.h">utf8locale.h</A>
and defined in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/utf8locale.c">utf8locale.c</A>.</P>

<H3>The libutf8 library</H3>


<P>A portable implementation of the ISO/ANSI C API, which supports 8-bit locales
and UTF-8 locales, can be found in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/libutf8-0.7.3.tar.gz">libutf8-0.7.3.tar.gz</A>.</P>
<P>Advantages:
<UL>
<LI>Unicode UTF-8 support now, portably, even on OSes whose multibyte character
support does not work or which don't have multibyte/wide character support
at all.</LI>
<LI>The same binary works in all OS supported 8-bit locales and in UTF-8 locales.</LI>
<LI>When an OS vendor adds proper multibyte character support, you can take
advantage of it by simply recompiling without -DHAVE_LIBUTF8 compiler option.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>The Plan9 way</H3>


<P>The Plan9 operating system, a variant of Unix, uses UTF-8 as character
encoding in all applications. Its wide character type is called
`<CODE>Rune</CODE>', not `<CODE>wchar_t</CODE>'. Parts of its libraries, written by
Rob Pike and Howard Trickey, are available at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/netlib/research/9libs/9libs-1.0.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/netlib/research/9libs/9libs-1.0.tar.gz</A>.
Another similar library, written by Alistair G. Crooks, is

In particular, each of these libraries contains an UTF-8 aware regular
expression matcher.</P>
<P>Drawback of this API:
<UL>
<LI>UTF-8 is compiled in, not optional. Programs compiled in this universe lose
support for the 8-bit encodings which are still frequently used in Europe.</LI>

</P>

<H3>For graphical user interface</H3>


<P>The Qt-2.0 library

contains a fully-Unicode QString class. You can use the member functions
QString::utf8 and QString::fromUtf8 to convert to/from UTF-8 encoded text.
The QString::ascii and QString::latin1 member functions should not be used
any more.</P>

<H3>For advanced text handling</H3>


<P>The previously mentioned libraries implement Unicode aware versions of
the ASCII concepts. Here are libraries which deal with Unicode concepts,
such as titlecase (a third letter case, different from uppercase and
lowercase), distinction between punctuation and symbols, canonical
decomposition, combining classes, canonical ordering and the like.</P>

<P>Advantages:
<UL>
<LI>iconv is POSIX standardized, programs using iconv to convert from/to UTF-8
will also run under Solaris. However, the names for the character sets differ
between platforms. For example, "EUC-JP" under glibc is "eucJP" under HP-UX.
(The official IANA name for this character set is "EUC-JP", so it's clearly
a HP-UX deficiency.)</LI>
<LI>On glibc-2.1 systems, no additional library is needed. On other systems, one of
the two other iconv implementations can be used.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Java</A>
</H2>


<P>Java has Unicode support built into the language. The type `char' denotes
a Unicode character, and the `java.lang.String' class denotes a string
built up from Unicode characters.</P>
<P>Java can display any Unicode characters through its windowing system AWT,
provided that
1. you set the Java system property "user.language" appropriately,
2. the /usr/lib/java/lib/font.properties.<I>language</I> font set
definitions are appropriate, and
3. the fonts specified in that file are installed.
For example, in order to display text containing japanese characters,
you would install japanese fonts and run "java -Duser.language=ja ...".
You can combine font sets: In order to display western european, greek
and japanese characters simultaneously, you would create a combination
of the files "font.properties" (covers ISO-8859-1), "font.properties.el"
(covers ISO-8859-7) and "font.properties.ja" into a single file.
??This is untested??</P>
<P>The interfaces java.io.DataInput and java.io.DataOutput have methods called
`readUTF' and `writeUTF' respectively. But note that they don't use UTF-8;
they use a modified UTF-8 encoding: the NUL character is encoded as the
two-byte sequence 0xC0 0x80 instead of 0x00, and a 0x00 byte is added at
the end. Encoded this way, strings can contain NUL characters and nevertheless
need not be prefixed with a length field - the C &lt;string.h&gt; functions
like strlen() and strcpy() can be used to manipulate them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Lisp</A>
</H2>


<P>The Common Lisp standard specifies two character types: `base-char' and
`character'. It's up to the implementation to support Unicode or not.
The language also specifies a keyword argument `:external-format' to `open',
as the natural place to specify a character set or encoding.</P>
<P>Among the free Common Lisp implementations, only CLISP
<A HREF="http://clisp.cons.org/">http://clisp.cons.org/</A>
supports Unicode. You need a CLISP version from March 2000 or newer.
<A HREF="ftp://clisp.cons.org/pub/lisp/clisp/source/clispsrc.tar.gz">ftp://clisp.cons.org/pub/lisp/clisp/source/clispsrc.tar.gz</A>.
The types `base-char' and `character' are both equivalent to 16-bit Unicode.
The functions <CODE>char-width</CODE> and <CODE>string-width</CODE> provide an
API comparable to <CODE>wcwidth()</CODE> and <CODE>wcswidth()</CODE>.
The encoding used for file or socket/pipe I/O can be specified through the
`:external-format' argument. The encodings used for tty I/O and the default
encoding for file/socket/pipe I/O are locale dependent.</P>
<P>Among the commercial Common Lisp implementations:</P>
<P>LispWorks
<A HREF="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/">http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/</A>
supports Unicode.
The type `base-char' is equivalent to ISO-8859-1, and the type `simple-char'
(subtype of `character') contains all Unicode characters.
The encoding used for file I/O can be specified through the
`:external-format' argument, for example '(:UTF-8).
Limitations: Encodings cannot be used for socket I/O. The editor cannot edit
UTF-8 encoded files.</P>
<P>Eclipse
<A HREF="http://www.elwood.com/eclipse/eclipse.htm">http://www.elwood.com/eclipse/eclipse.htm</A>
supports Unicode. See
<A HREF="http://www.elwood.com/eclipse/char.htm">http://www.elwood.com/eclipse/char.htm</A>.
The type `base-char' is equivalent
to ISO-8859-1, and the type `character' contains all Unicode characters.
The encoding used for file I/O can be specified through a combination of
the `:element-type' and `:external-format' arguments to `open'.
Limitations: Character attribute functions are locale dependent. Source and
compiled source files cannot contain Unicode string literals.</P>
<P>The commercial Common Lisp implementation Allegro CL, in version 6.0, has
Unicode support. The types `base-char' and `character' are both equivalent
to 16-bit Unicode. The encoding used for file I/O can be specified through the
`:external-format' argument, for example <CODE>:external-format :utf8</CODE>.
The default encoding is locale dependent. More details are at

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Ada95</A>
</H2>


<P>Ada95 was designed for Unicode support and the Ada95 standard library
features special ISO 10646-1 data types Wide_Character and Wide_String,
as well as numerous associated procedures and functions. The GNU Ada95
compiler (gnat-3.11 or newer) supports UTF-8 as the external encoding of
wide characters. This allows you to use UTF-8 in both source code and
application I/O. To activate it in the application, use "WCEM=8" in the
FORM string when opening a file, and use compiler option "-gnatW8" if
the source code is in UTF-8. See the GNAT

</H2>


<P>Since JavaScript version 1.3, strings are always Unicode. There is no
character type, but you can use the \uXXXX notation for Unicode characters
inside strings. No normalization is done internally, so it expects to receive
Unicode Normalization Form C, which the W3C recommends. See
