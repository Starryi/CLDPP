<EM>How to configure a Linux firewall to masquerade
IPsec- and PPTP-based Virtual Private Network traffic, allowing you to
establish a VPN connection without losing the security and flexibility of
your Linux firewall's internet connection and allowing you to make
available a VPN server that does not have a registered internet IP address.
Brief information on configuring the VPN client and server is also given.</EM>

<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Introduction </A>
</H2>

<P>This document describes how to configure masquerading of IPsec and PPTP VPN
traffic. SSH-based VPNs (such as that sold by F-Secure and outlined in the
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/help/ldp/mini/VPN.html">VPN mini-HOWTO</A>)
are based on standard TCP traffic and do not need any special kernel
modifications.</P>

<P>VPN Masquerade allows you to establish one or more IPsec and/or PPTP
sessions to internet-accessible VPN servers via your Linux
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?firewall+machine">internet firewall</A> without forcing you to connect to your
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?internet+service+provider">ISP</A>
directly from the VPN
client system - thus retaining all of the benefits of your Linux internet
firewall. It also allows you to set up a VPN server with a Private Network
IP address (as described in 
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1918.html">RFC1918</A>) behind a masquerading Linux firewall, permitting you to
provide relatively secure access to a private network via only one
registered IP address - even if that IP address represents a dynamic
dial-up link.</P>
<P>It is strongly recommended that you understand, configure and test regular
IP Masquerading before you attempt to set up VPN masquerading. Please see
the 
<A HREF="http://members.home.net/ipmasq/ipmasq-HOWTO-1.82.html">IP Masquerade HOWTO</A> and the IP Masquerade Resource page at
<A HREF="http://ipmasq.cjb.net/">http://ipmasq.cjb.net/</A> before proceeding. Planning and setting
up your VPN and firewall is beyond the scope of this document. Here are

<P>The patch for the 2.0.x-series kernels works well on Linux kernel version
2.0.36, has been incorporated into the 2.0.37 release, may work on versions
earlier than 2.0.36, and should work on Linux kernels up to about version
2.1.102. The IP masquerade code in the kernel was restructured at about
version 2.1.103, requiring a different patch for the 2.1.105+ and 2.2.x
series of kernels. A patch is available for kernels from 2.2.5 to 2.2.17,
and it may work on earlier kernels.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is a VPN?</A>
</H2>

<P>A 
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?VPN">Virtual Private Network</A>, or &#34;VPN&#34;, is a tunnel that carries
private network traffic from one endpoint system to another over a public
network (such as the Internet) without the traffic being aware that there
are intermediate hops between the endpoints, or the intermediate hops being
aware they are carrying the network packets that are traversing the tunnel.
The tunnel may optionally compress and/or encrypt the data, providing
enhanced performance and some measure of security.</P>
<P>The &#34;Virtual&#34; part stems from the fact that you are constructing
a private link over a public network, rather than actually buying a direct
hardwired link over leased lines. The VPN allows you to pretend you are
using a leased line or direct telephone call to communicate between the endpoints.</P>
<P>You may find the VPN FAQ at
<A HREF="http://kubarb.phsx.ukans.edu/~tbird/vpn/FAQ.html">http://kubarb.phsx.ukans.edu/~tbird/vpn/FAQ.html</A>
informative.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 What is IPsec?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?IPsec">IPsec</A></B>
is a set of standard protocols for implementing secure communications
and encryption key exchange between computers. It can be used to implement
a VPN.</P>
<P>An IPsec VPN generally consists of two communications channels between the
endpoint hosts: a key-exchange channel over which authentication and
encryption key information is passed, and one or more data channels over
which private network traffic is carried.</P>
<P>The key-exchange channel is a standard UDP connection to and from port 500. The
data channels carrying the traffic between the client and server use IP
protocol number 50 (ESP).</P>
<P>More information is available in F-Secure's IPsec FAQ at
<A HREF="http://www.Europe.F-Secure.com/support/vpn+/faq/techfaq.html">http://www.Europe.F-Secure.com/support/vpn+/faq/techfaq.html</A>,
and in
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2402.html">RFC2402</A>
(the AH protocol, IP protocol number 51),
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2406.html">RFC2406</A>
(the ESP protocol, IP protocol number 50),
and
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2408.html">RFC2408</A>
(the ISAKMP key-exchange protocol).</P>
<P>IPsec is a peer-to-peer protocol. However, since most people will be
exposed to it in the form of an originate-only Windows client being used to
access a central network security gateway, &#34;client&#34; will be used to
refer to the endpoint host that the user is sitting in front of and
&#34;server&#34; will be used to refer to the central network security
gateway.</P>
<P>Important note: If your VPN is based on the AH protocol (including AH+ESP), it
cannot be masqueraded. The AH protocol specifies a cryptographic checksum
across portions of the IP header, including the IP addresses. IP Masquerade is
implemented by modifying the source IP address for outbound packets and the
destination IP address for inbound packets. Since the masquerading gateway
cannot participate in the encryption key exchange, it cannot generate the
correct cryptographic checksums for the modified IP headers. Thus the
modified IP packets will be discarded by the recipient as invalid, because
they fail the cryptographic checksum test.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 What is PPTP?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?PPTP">PPTP</A></B>
stands for <EM><B>P</B></EM>oint-to-<EM><B>P</B></EM>oint
<EM><B>T</B></EM>unnelling <EM><B>P</B></EM>rotocol. It is a
Microsoft-proposed protocol for implementing a VPN.</P>
<P>The PPTP VPN protocol consists of two communications channels between the
client and server: a control channel over which link-management information
is passed, and a data channel over which (possibly encrypted) private network
traffic is carried.</P>
<P>The control channel is a standard TCP connection to port 1723 on the
server. The data channel carrying the private network traffic uses IP
protocol number 47 (GRE), a generic encapsulation protocol described in
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1701.html">RFC1701</A>. The transparent transmission of data over the data channel
is achieved by negotiating a standard PPP connection over it, just as if it
were a dialup connection directly from the client to the server. The
options negotiated over the tunnel by PPP control whether the data is
compressed and/or encrypted, thus PPTP itself has nothing to do with
encryption.</P>
<P>The details of the PPTP protocol are documented in
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2637.html">RFC2637</A>.</P>
<P>Microsoft's implementation of the PPTP protocol is not considered very
secure. If you're interested in the details, here are three separate analyses:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 What is FWZ?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>FWZ</B> is a proprietary encryption protocol developed by 
<A HREF="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</A>.
It is used in VPNs that are built around their Firewall-1 product.</P>
<P>A Checkpoint-based firewall can be configured in several modes. The
&#34;FWZ Encapsulation&#34; mode <EM>cannot</EM> be masqueraded. The
&#34;IKE&#34; mode, which uses standard IPsec protocols, can be
masqueraded with minor configuration changes on the VPN gateway.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Why masquerade a VPN client?</A>
</H2>

<P>Most current VPN clients assume you will be connecting the client computer
directly to the internet. Doing this when you have only a single connection
for internet access bypasses your Linux firewall and the security and
access-sharing capabilities that it provides. Extending the Linux firewall
to also masquerade VPN traffic allows you to retain the firewalling
security provided by the Linux firewall as well as permitting the other
systems on your local network to access the internet regardless of whether
or not the VPN network connection is active.</P>
<P>If your firewall is being used in a corporate setting you may also wish to
require your VPN client users to go through that firewall for security
reasons, rather than providing them with modems so they can dial out on
their own when they need to use VPN. VPN Masquerade allows you to do so
even if the desktops do not have registered IP addresses.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Can several clients on my local network use IPsec simultaneously?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes, though there may occasionally be minor problems.</P>
<P>The IPsec protocols define a method for identifying the traffic streams
called the <EM>Security Parameters Index</EM> (&#34;SPI&#34;).
Unfortunately the SPI used by outbound traffic is different from the SPI
used by inbound traffic, and there is no other identifying information
available that is not encrypted, so association of the inbound and outbound
data streams is difficult and not perfectly reliable.</P>
<P>IPsec Masquerade attempts to associate inbound and outbound ESP traffic by
serializing new connections. While this has worked well in testing, it
cannot be guaranteed to be perfectly reliable, and the serialization of new
traffic may result in some timeouts if the link is saturated or if many
local IPsec hosts attempt to initiate communications or rekey with the same
remote IPsec host simultaneously. </P>
<P>It is also assumed that should this association scheme fail to associate
the traffic streams correctly, the IPsec hosts themselves will discard the
incorrectly routed traffic because it will have the wrong SPI values. This
is required by the IPsec RFCs.</P>
<P>These problems could be eliminated if there was some way to sniff the new
SPI values from the ISAKMP key exchange before any ESP traffic appears, but
unfortunately that portion of the key exchange is encrypted.</P>
<P>To minimize the problems associated with this, it is recommended that you
open a command window on your masqueraded IPsec host and run the
&#34;ping&#34; program pinging a host on the remote network for as long
as you have the tunnel up.</P>
<P>See the IPsec technical notes at the end of the document for more details.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="multiclientpptp"></A> </P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Can several clients on my local network use PPTP simultaneously?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P>You must enable PPTP Call ID masquerade when configuring your kernel in
order to distinguish between multiple data streams from the same server.
PPTP masq with Call ID masq enabled will support many concurrent masqueraded
sessions with no restrictions on which server a client can call.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2637.html">The PPTP RFC</A>
specifies in section 3.1.3 that there may only be one control channel
connection between two systems. This <EM>should</EM> mean that you can only
masquerade one PPTP session at a time with a given remote server, but in
practice the MS implementation of PPTP does not enforce this, at least not as
of NT 4.0 Service Pack 4. If the PPTP server you're trying to connect to only
permits one connection at a time, it's following the protocol rules properly.
Note that this does not affect a masqueraded server, only multiple masqueraded
clients attempting to contact the same remote server.</P>
<P>For another alternative, see the next question...</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 Can I access the remote network from my entire local network?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes. However, your VPN client must be able to forward IP traffic.</P>
<P>This means that you'll either have to use a Linux VPN client or a MS NT VPN
client. The IP stack in W'95 and W'98 does not support IP forwarding. NT
Workstation will work for this, and is less expensive than NT Server if
you're only using it to route encrypted traffic.</P>
<P>If you cannot install a Linux or NT-based VPN client, then you'll have to
enable PPTP Call-ID masquerade if you are using PPTP, and install VPN
client software on every system you want to provide access for. This is
inefficient, aesthetically revolting, a security weakness, and may not work
if the PPTP server correctly implements the protocol, but it's cheaper
than licensing NT.</P>
<P>Network-to-network routing this way works very well. This is how I have my
home network set up for telecommuting. It does require a little more
networking knowhow than simply giving everybody their own VPN client.</P>
<P>In my experience, network-to-network routing in a pure-MS environment
requires RRAS be installed at both ends of the tunnel.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.9">2.9 Why masquerade the VPN server?</A>
</H2>

<P>If your VPN server has a registered IP address you do not need to
masquerade it, simply configure your firewall to route the VPN traffic
properly as described below.</P>
<P>If your VPN server has a Private-Network IP address you will need to
redirect the inbound traffic to it and masquerade the outbound traffic from
it. Masquerading allows you to make a VPN server available to the internet
even if you only have one assigned IP address. This should work even if
your IP address is dynamically assigned: you would publicize the IP address
for clients through the use of a third-party dynamic DNS service such as
that provided by 
<A HREF="http://www.ddns.org/">DDNS.ORG</A>
or 
<A HREF="http://www.cjb.net/">CJB.NET</A>
and configure the clients to connect to a system named
<CODE>our-company.ddns.org</CODE> or something similar. Note that this is a
security risk, because it is possible for an incorrect IP address to be
retrieved from the dynamic DNS server through timing problems, a failure to
properly register the current dynamic IP address, or a third party
registering a different IP address under the system name.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.10">2.10 Why patch the Linux kernel?</A>
</H2>

<P>The largest problem in masquerading VPN traffic is that the stock 
Linux IP masquerade has no special awareness of IP protocols other than
TCP, UDP and ICMP.</P>
<P>All IP traffic may be forwarded and filtered by IP address, but
masquerading IP protocols other than TCP, UDP and ICMP requires modifying the
kernel.</P>
<P>The PPTP control channel is plain TCP and requires no special setup beyond
letting it through the firewall and masquerading it.</P>
<P>Masquerading the IPsec and PPTP data channels requires a modification that
adds support for the ESP and GRE protocols to the masquerading code, and
masquerading the ISAKMP key exchange protocol requires a modification that
prevents masquerade from altering the UDP source port number and adds
tracking of the ISAKMP cookie values instead of the port number.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.11">2.11 Current Status</A>
</H2>

<P>The 2.0.x kernel patch works on kernel 2.0.36 and is incorporated into the
standard 2.0.37 and higher kernel releases. It may work on earlier kernels but
I have not tested it, and I recommend you upgrade to kernel 2.0.38 anyway
for security reasons if you are running an older kernel.</P>
<P>The 2.2.x kernel patch works on kernels from 2.2.5 to 2.2.17 and may work
on earlier kernels, but that has not been tested. It has been submitted for
inclusion in the standard 2.2.18 release.</P>
<P>I don't have the resources to follow the development kernels, so at this
time no work on VPN Masquerade for 2.3.x or 2.4.x has taken place. If you
know someone who <EM>is</EM> working on this, please let me know.</P>
<P>The 2.0.x kernel patch has been tested and works on x86 and Sparc systems,
and the 2.2.x kernel patch has been tested and works on x86 and PowerPC systems,
but there should be no major problems in porting to other architectures. I
believe the architecture dependencies would only be in endian-ness within the
bitmaps in the GRE header definition used to format debugging log messages.
If anyone ports this to a non-Intel architecture I'd appreciate hearing
about it so I can merge any changes into the master copy.</P>

<LI>If you are masquerading a VPN server, obtain and install the
<CODE>ipportfw</CODE> patch from the site given above.
<P>There is a known conflict between the VPN Masquerade patch and two other
networking patches: the IP Firewall Chains patch and the ipportfw patch.
They are all trying to add options at the same location in
<CODE>net/ipv4/Config.in</CODE>, and the changes made by one patch alter the
context that the other patches are looking for.</P>
<P>If you're applying the VPN Masquerade patch and the IP Firewall Chains or
ipportfw patches to your 2.0.x kernel, you will have to manually edit
<CODE>net/ipv4/Config.in</CODE> and add the block of configuration options from
the patch file that fails to work. Looking at the patch file should show
you where in <CODE>net/ipv4/Config.in</CODE> the new options should be added.</P>
<P>The syntax of patch files is simple. For each block of changes to make,
there are two sections: the first shows the &#34;before&#34; state, with
an indication of lines to be changed or deleted; the second shows the
&#34;after&#34; state, with an indication of the lines that have been changed
or added. Use the first section to find where to add the lines, and add the
lines that are indicated in the second section.</P>
<P>This should not be a problem once those patches are updated for 2.0.37+</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 A note about dynamic IP addressing</A>
</H2>

<P>If your firewall is assigned a dynamic IP address by your ISP (dialup
accounts are this way, as are some cable internet services), then you
should add the following to the startup script
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
echo 7 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This enables dynamic IP address following, which means that should your
connection drop and be reestablished, any active sessions will be updated
to the new IP address rather than using the old IP address. This does not
mean that the session will continue across the interruption, rather that it
will be closed down quickly.</P>
<P>If you do not do this, then there may be a &#34;dead period&#34; after you redial
and before old masq table entries expire where you're being masqueraded
with the wrong IP address, which will prevent your establishing a
connection.</P>
<P>This is particularly helpful if you are using a demand-dial daemon such as
<CODE>diald</CODE> to manage your dialup connection.</P>
<P>See <CODE>
<A HREF="file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ip_dynaddr.txt">/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ip_dynaddr.txt</A></CODE> for
more details.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Additional setup for a Private-IP VPN Server</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are setting up VPN masquerade for a Private-IP VPN server (that is,
you wish to provide for <EM>inbound</EM> connections as well as
<EM>outbound</EM> connections), you also need to install two
packet-forwarding utilities. One (<CODE>ipportfw</CODE>) forwards inbound TCP
or UDP traffic addressed to a specific port on the firewall system to a
system on the local network behind the firewall. This is used to redirect
the initial inbound 1723/tcp PPTP control channel or 500/udp ISAKMP traffic
to the VPN server. The other (<CODE>ipfwd</CODE>) is a more generic forwarding
utility that allows you to do this for any IP protocol. It is used to
forward the initial inbound 47/ip (GRE) or 50/ip (ESP) data channel traffic
to the VPN server.</P>
<P>Outbound responses to the inbound 1723/tcp or 500/udp traffic are
masqueraded using the normal IP-Masquerade facilities in the Linux kernel.
The outbound 47/ip or 50/ip traffic is masqueraded using the VPN-Masquerade
kernel patch you installed earlier.</P>
<P>Once these utilities are installed, you must configure them to forward the
traffic to the VPN server.</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Configuring <CODE>ipportfw</CODE> under 2.0.x kernels
<P>The following commands will set up <CODE>ipportfw</CODE> to forward the initial
inbound 500/udp traffic to the IPsec server:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
# Static-IP ipportfw setup for IPsec

The following commands will set up <CODE>ipportfw</CODE> to forward the initial
inbound 1723/tcp traffic to the PPTP server:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
# Static-IP ipportfw setup for PPTP
# Clear the ipportfw forwarding table

/sbin/ipportfw -A -t 200.200.200.200/1723 -R 10.0.0.2/1723
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that the ipportfw command line requires the internet IP address of the
firewall, and you cannot specify the interface (e.g. <CODE>ppp0</CODE>) as you
can with ipfwadm. This means that for a dynamic-IP connection (such as a
typical dialup PPP connection) you have to run these commands every time
you connect to the internet and are assigned a new IP address. You can do
this quite easily - simply add the following to your
<CODE>/etc/ppp/ip-up</CODE> or <CODE>/etc/ppp/ip-up.local</CODE> script:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
# Dynamic-IP ipportfw setup for IPsec

<LI>Configuring <CODE>ipfwd</CODE> under both 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels

<BLOCKQUOTE>

/sbin/ipfwd --masq 10.0.0.2 50 &amp;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
/sbin/ipfwd --masq 10.0.0.2 47 &amp;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

It should only be run once, from your <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE> script.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The techniques described here can be generalized to allow masquerading of
most any type of server - HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and so forth. Servers that are
purely TCP- or UDP-based will not require <CODE>ipfwd</CODE>.</P>

<P>If you are masquerading a PPTP server you also need to make sure that you have
<EM>not</EM> enabled PPTP Call ID masquerade in the kernel. Enabling PPTP Call ID
masquerade builds in some assumptions that you're masquerading only PPTP
clients, so enabling it will prevent proper masquerade of the PPTP server
traffic. This also means that with the 2.0.x version of the patch you cannot
simultaneously masquerade a PPTP server and PPTP clients.</P>

<P>The Linux Router Project at

<P>VPN Masquerade is supposed to be included in LRP version 2.2.9 - to verify

masquerade to an earlier version of LRP then somebody on the LRP mailing
list may be able to provide a diskette image for you, or you can roll your

Simply configure your masquerading gateway to masquerade IPsec traffic as
described above.</P>
<P>Checkpoint's proprietary FWZ protocol is more complicated. There are two
modes that FWZ can be used in: encapsulated mode and transport mode. In
encapsulated mode, integrity checking is done over the whole IP packet,
just as in IPsec's AH protocol. Changing the IP address breaks this
integrity guarantee, thus encapsulated FWZ tunnels <EM>cannot</EM> be
masqueraded.</P>
<P>In transport mode, only the data portion of the packet is encrypted, and
the IP headers are not verified against changes. In this mode, masquerading
should work with the modifications described above.</P>
<P>The configuration for encapsulated or transport mode is done in the
FireWall-1 GUI. In the network object for the Firewall, under the VPN
tab, edit the FWZ properties. The third tab in FWZ properties allows you
to set encapsulated mode.</P>
<P>You will only be able to masquerade one client at a time.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Testing</A>
</H2>

<P>To test VPN Masquerade:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Bring up your ISP connection from your Linux box and verify that it
still works properly.
</LI>
<LI>Verify that regular masquerading still works properly by, for
example, trying to browse a Web site or access an FTP server from a
masqueraded box on your local network.
</LI>
<LI>PPTP: Verify that you have masquerading of the PPTP control channel
properly configured: try to telnet from the PPTP client system to port 1723
on your PPTP server. Don't expect to see anything, but if you get a timeout
or an error saying the connection failed, take a look at the masquerade
rules on your Linux box to ensure that you are indeed masquerading traffic
from your PPTP client to TCP port 1723 on your PPTP server.
</LI>
<LI>PPTP: Attempt to establish a PPTP connection. I recommend you also run
<CODE>RASMON</CODE> if it is available, as this will give you a minimal amount
of information about the status of the connection. If you establish a
PPTP connection on the first try, congratulations! You're done!
</LI>
<LI>IPsec: Attempt to establish an IPsec connection.
</LI>
</OL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Possible problems</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several things that may prevent a VPN session from being established.
We'll work through them going from the client to the server and back again.
We will assume you're using a Windows-based client for the examples, as that's
the most common case.</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Connect information: the &#34;telephone number&#34; in the VPN dialup
configuration must be the Internet IP address of the VPN server, or the IP
address of the firewall if the server is being masqueraded.
</LI>
<LI>PPTP and strong encryption: unless both client and server have the
128-bit <CODE>NDISWAN.SYS</CODE> or W'95/'98 PPTP software, you will not be able
to establish a strongly-encrypted session. Unfortunately in my experience
this problem does not generate any obvious error messages, it just keeps
trying and trying and trying... The strong encryption update can be
obtained from the Microsoft secure site URL given in the &#34;Configuring
a MS Client&#34; section.
<P>This may also affect IPsec clients, if they use the MS-supplied encryption
libraries rather than using their own libraries.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Routing: verify that the default route on your VPN client is pointing
at the Linux masquerade box. Run the <CODE>route print</CODE> command and look
for an <CODE>0.0.0.0</CODE> entry.
<P>If other masqueraded services (such as HTTP, FTP, IRC, etc.) work from
your VPN client system then this probably is not the problem.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Masquerading: there are two parts to the VPN session.
<P>For IPsec, the authentication and key exchange service (ISAKMP), which is a
normal UDP session to port 500 on the remote IPsec host, must be configured
for masquerading as you would any other UDP service (such as DNS).</P>
<P>For PPTP, the control channel, which is a normal TCP session to port 1723
on the PPTP server, must be configured for masquerading as you would any
other TCP service (such as HTTP).</P>
<P>The encrypted data channel in IPsec is carried over ESP, IP protocol 50.
The encrypted data channel in PPTP is carried over GRE, IP protocol 47.
(Note that these are <EM>not</EM> TCP or UDP port numbers!)
Since the 2.0 Linux kernel only lets you specify <CODE>TCP</CODE>,
<CODE>UDP</CODE>, <CODE>ICMP</CODE> and <CODE>ALL</CODE> IP protocols when creating
masquerade rules, you must also masquerade <CODE>ALL</CODE> protocol traffic if
you are masquerading only specific services. If you are masquerading
everything, you don't need to worry about this.</P>
<P>In order to isolate the firewall rules from the kernel masquerade code,
try establishing a VPN connection with your firewall completely open, then
if it works, tighten the firewall rules.</P>

it takes to prove that a masqueraded VPN connection can be established!</P>

</LI>
<LI>Intermediary hops and the Internet:
All routers between your Linux firewall and the remote IPsec host must
forward packets carrying IP protocol 50.
All routers between your Linux firewall and the PPTP server must forward
packets carrying IP protocol 47.
If you had IPsec or PPTP working when your VPN client system directly
dialled your ISP then this probably is not the problem.
<P>To isolate whether an intermediary hop is blocking GRE traffic, use a
patched <CODE>traceroute</CODE> to trace the progress of GRE packets. See the
resources section for information on the traceroute patch. A similar patch
for ESP is in the works.</P>

</LI>
<LI>The remote firewall: the firewall at the server end must allow a
system with the IP address assigned to your Linux box by your ISP to
connect to port 500/udp on the IPsec host or port 1723/tcp on the PPTP
server. If you had the VPN working when your VPN client system directly
dialled your ISP then this probably is not the problem.
</LI>
<LI>The server firewall and ESP: the IPsec encrypted data is carried
over IP protocol 50. If the firewall the remote IPsec host is behind does
not forward ESP traffic in both directions, IPsec will not work. Again, if
you had IPsec working when your IPsec client system directly dialled your
ISP then this probably is not the problem.
</LI>
<LI>The server firewall and GRE: the PPTP data channel is carried as a
GRE-encapsulated (IP protocol 47) PPP session. If the firewall your PPTP
server is behind does not forward GRE traffic in both directions, PPTP will
not work. Again, if you had PPTP working when your PPTP client system
directly dialed your ISP then this probably isn't the problem.
</LI>
<LI>The patch: If your IPsec client successfully authenticates you but
cannot establish a network connection, the patch may not be masquerading
ESP traffic properly. If your PPTP client establishes the control channel
(RASMON beeps and the little telephone lights up) and sends GRE traffic
(the upper light in RASMON blinks) but gets no GRE traffic back (the lower
light in RASMON does not blink in response) the patch may not be
masquerading GRE traffic properly.
<P>Look in <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE> for log entries showing that VPN
traffic was seen. Turning on VPN debugging may help you to determine
whether or not the patch is at fault. Also run a sniffer on your internet
connection and look for outbound VPN traffic <EM>(see below)</EM>.</P>

</LI>
<LI>Multiple clients: the older PPTP patch does NOT support masquerading
of multiple PPTP clients attempting to access the <EM>same</EM> PPTP
server. If you're trying to do this, you should take a look at your network
design and consider whether you should set up a PPTP router for your local
clients. The 2.0 patch incorporates Call-ID masquerading, which allows
multiple simultaneous sessions. <EM>Note:</EM> do not enable PPTP Call-ID
masquerade if you are masquerading a PPTP Server. At the current time this
will prevent the server's outbound traffic from being masqueraded.

this, the Internet is down <CODE>:)</CODE> or some intermediary is blocking ESP
or GRE traffic.
</LI>
<LI>Boundary network (DMZ) side of server firewall: UDP and ESP or TCP

local workgroup a name that does not show up in the remote environment. The
reason is that while your PPTP client is logged into the remote
environment, it will see the remote environment's domain name servers, and
will only see the remote computers in that workgroup.
<P>You should avoid the lazy option. Microsoft ships Windows set up for a
default workgroup name of WORKGROUP. Some people will be lazy and accept
that as their workgroup when they set up their computers. So there is a
good chance that the remote environment will have a workgroup called
WORKGROUP, administrators willing or not.</P>

<P>I think that this will apply regardless of the VPN in use, as name services
aren't dependent on the transport. If your client(s) can see the WINS servers
on the remote network then you may experience this, PPTP or no PPTP.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 MS network password issues</A>
</H2>

<P>When you are using a VPN to access a MS network you should remember that
you will have to provide two different authentication tokens - one to
connect to the VPN server (the VPN password) and the other to access
resources on the remote network once the connection is established (the
network password).</P>
<P>The VPN password - the username and password you enter into your VPN client
when initiating the call to the VPN server - is only used by the VPN server
to grant you permission to connect to the network via the VPN. It isn't
used for anything else once you're connected.</P>
<P>The VPN password is <EM>not</EM> used to prove your identity to other
computers on the remote network. You must provide another username/password
pair - your network password - for that.</P>
<P>There are two ways to supply a network password. Your network password may
be the same username/password pair you supplied when logging onto the local
network when you started your computer up. If it is different, you can
configure your VPN client to ask you for your network password for the
remote network once the VPN connection is established.</P>
<P>If you are successfully connecting to the VPN server but you cannot access
any of the resources provided by the remote network, then you aren't
providing a valid network username/password pair for the remote network.
Verify that the username and password for your local network will also work
on the remote network, or set your VPN client to prompt you for a username
and password for use on the remote network and &#34;log on&#34; to the
remote network once the VPN connection is established.</P>

<P>If you're having trouble with your IPsec tunnel regularly dying, particularly
if checking the system logs on the firewall shows that ISAKMP packets with
&#34;zero cookie&#34; values are being seen, here's what's happening:</P>
<P>Earlier versions of the IPsec Masq patch did not change the timeout for
masq table entries for ISAKMP UDP packets. The masq table entries for the
ISAKMP UDP traffic would time out fairly quickly (relative to the data
channel) and be removed; if the remote IPsec host then decided to initiate
rekeying before the local IPsec host did, the inbound ISAKMP traffic for
the rekey couldn't be routed to the masqueraded host. The rekey traffic
would be discarded, the remote IPsec host would think the link had failed,
and the connection would eventually be terminated.</P>
<P>The 2.0.x patch has been modified from its original version to increase the
timeout on ISAKMP UDP masq table entries. Get the current version of the patch,
available via the sites given in the Resources section, and repatch and

<H2><A NAME="s6">6. IPsec masquerade technical notes and special security considerations</A></H2>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Limitations and weaknesses of IPsec masquerade</A>
</H2>

<P>Traffic that uses the AH protocol <EM>cannot</EM> be masqueraded. The AH
protocol incorporates a cryptographic checksum across the IP addresses that
the masquerade gateway cannot correctly regenerate. Thus, all masqueraded
AH traffic will be discarded as having invalid checksums.</P>
<P>IPsec traffic  using transport-mode ESP also cannot be reliably masqueraded.
Transport mode ESP essentially encrypts everything after the IP header.
Since, for example, the TCP and UDP checksums include the IP source and
destination addresses, and the TCP/UDP checksum is within the encrypted
payload and thus cannot be recalculated after the masquerade gateway alters
the IP addresses, the TCP/UDP header will fail the checksum test at the
remote gateway and the packet will be discarded. Protocols that do not
include information about the source or destination IP addresses may
successfully use masqueraded transport mode.</P>
<P>Apart from these limitations, IPsec masquerade is secure and reliable when
only one IPsec host is being masqueraded at a time, or when each
masqueraded host is communicating with a different remote host. When more
than one masqueraded host is communicating with the same remote host, a few
weaknesses show up:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Transport-mode communications are subject to collisions.
<P>If two or more masqueraded hosts are using transport mode to communicate
with the same remote host, and the security policy of the remote host permits
multiple transport-mode sessions with the same peer, it is possible for
sessions to experience collisions. This happens because the IP
address of the <EM>masquerading gateway</EM> will be used to identify the
sessions, and any other identifying information cannot be masqueraded
because it is within the encrypted portion of the packet.</P>
<P>If the remote host's security policy does not permit multiple
transport-mode sessions with the same peer, the situation is even worse:
the more-recently-negotiated transport mode session will likely completely
take over <EM>all</EM> of the traffic from the older session, causing the
older session to &#34;go dead&#34;. While the established sessions
from the older transport-mode IPsec session may be quickly reset if the
remote host isn't expecting to receive the traffic, at least one packet of
information will be sent to the wrong host. This information will probably
be discarded by the recipient, but it will still be sent.</P>
<P><EM>Thus, a transport-mode collision may result in leaking of information
between the two sessions or termination of one or both sessions.</EM> Using
IPsec in transport mode via a masquerading gateway is <EM>not
recommended</EM> if there is the possibility that other transport mode
IPsec sessions will be attempted via the same masquerading gateway to the
same remote IPsec host.</P>
<P>IPsec using tunnel mode with extruded network addressing (where the masqueraded
IPsec host is assigned an IP address from the remote host's network) is
<EM>not</EM> subject to these problems, as the IP addresses assigned from
the remote network will be used to identify the sessions instead of using
the IP address of the masquerading host.</P>


</LI>
<LI> ISAKMP communications are subject to cookie collisions.
<P>If two or more masqueraded hosts establishing a session to the same remote
host happen to select the same initiator cookie when initiating ISAKMP
traffic, the masquerading gateway will route all of the ISAKMP traffic to
the second host. There is a 1 in 2^64 (i.e. very small) chance of this
collision happening for each host, at the time of establishing the initial
ISAKMP connection.</P>
<P>Correcting this requires including the responder cookie in the key used to
route inbound ISAKMP traffic. This modification is incorporated into
IPsec masquerade for the 2.2.x kernel, and the short window between the
time the masqueraded host initiates the ISAKMP exchange and the remote host
responds is covered by discarding any new ISAKMP traffic that would collide
with the current outstanding traffic. This modification will be backported
to the 2.0.x code soon.</P>


</LI>
<LI> There may be a collision between SPI values on inbound traffic.
<P>Two or more masqueraded IPsec hosts communicating with the same remote
IPsec host may negotiate to use the same SPI value for inbound traffic. If
this happens the masquerading gateway will route all of the inbound traffic
to the first host to receive any inbound traffic using that SPI. The
possibility of this happening is about 1 in 2^32 for each outstanding
ESP session, and may occur on any rekey.</P>
<P>Since the SPI values refer to different SAs having different encryption
keys the first host will not be able to decrypt the data intended for the
other hosts, so no data leakage will occur. There is no way for the
masquerading gateway to detect or prevent this collision. The only way to
prevent this collision is for the remote IPsec host to check the SPI value
proposed by the masqueraded host to see if that SPI value is already in use
by another SA from the same IP address. It is not likely that this will be
done, since it imposes more overhead on an already expensive operation (the
rekey) to benefit a small percentage of users in case of a relatively rare
event.</P>


</LI>
<LI> Inbound and outbound SPI values may be misassociated.
<P>This is discussed in detail in the next section.</P>

</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>To avoid these problems the 2.2.x code by default prevents the
establishment of multiple connections to the same remote host. If the
weaknesses exposed by multiple connections to the same remote host are
acceptable, you can enable &#34;parallel sessions&#34;.</P>
<P>Blocking parallel sessions for security reasons can be annoying: there is
no way for the IPsec masquerade code to sniff the session and see when it
is terminating, so the masquerade table entries will persist for the IPsec
Masq Table Lifetime even if the session terminates immediately after it is
established. If parallel sessions are prevented, this means that the
server will be unavailable to other clients until the masq table entry for
the most recent session has timed out and been deleted. This can be up to
several hours.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Proper routing of inbound encrypted traffic</A>
</H2>

<P>The portion of the ISAKMP key exchange where the ESP SPI values are
communicated is encrypted, so the ESP SPI values must be determined by
inspection of the actual ESP traffic. Also, the outbound ESP traffic does
not contain any indication of what the inbound SPI will be. This means
there is no perfectly reliable way to associate inbound ESP traffic with
outbound ESP traffic.</P>
<P>IPsec masq attempts to associate inbound and outbound ESP traffic by
serializing initial ESP traffic on a by-remote-host basis. What this
means is:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If an outbound ESP packet with an SPI value that has not previously
been seen (or whose masquerade table entry has expired) is received (which
shall hereafter be called an &#34;initial packet&#34;), a masquerade
table entry for that SourceAddr+SPI+DestAddr combination is created. It is
marked as &#34;outstanding&#34;, that is, no inbound ESP traffic has been
received for it yet. This is done by setting the &#34;inbound SPI&#34;
value in the masq table entry to zero, which is a value reserved for uses
such as this. This will happen at the initiation of a new ESP connection
and at regular intervals when an existing ESP connection rekeys.

</LI>
<LI>As long as the masq table entry is outstanding, no other initial ESP
packets for the <EM>same remote host</EM> will be processed. The packets
are immediately discarded, and a system log entry is made saying the
traffic is temporarily blocked. This also applies to initial traffic from
the same masqueraded host going to the same remote host if the SPI values
differ. Traffic to other remote hosts, and traffic where both SPI values
are known (&#34;established&#34; traffic) is not affected by this.

</LI>
<LI>This could easily lead to a Denial of Service of the remote host, so
this outstanding ESP masq table entry is given a short lifetime, and only a
limited number of retries of the same traffic are allowed. This permits
round-robin access to the remote host if several masqueraded hosts are
attempting to initialize simultaneously and responses aren't coming back
very quickly, for example due to network congestion or a slow remote host.
The retry limitation begins once there is a collision, so the masqueraded
IPsec host can wait as long as necessary for a reply until there's a need
for serialization.

</LI>
<LI>When an ESP packet from the outstanding remote host is received and
the SPI value does not appear in any masq table entry, it is assumed that
the packet is the response to the outstanding initial packet. The SPI value
is stored in that masq table entry, thus associating the SPI values, and
the inbound ESP traffic is routed to the masqueraded host. At this point
another initial packet for the remote server may be processed.

</LI>
<LI>Any ESP traffic with a zero SPI value is discarded as invalid, per
the RFC requirements.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>There are several ways this can fail to associate traffic properly:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Network delays or a slow remote host can cause the response to the
first initial packet to be delayed long enough that the init masq table
entry expires and a different masqueraded host is given a chance to
initialize. This could cause the response to be associated with the wrong
outbound SPI, which would cause inbound traffic to be routed to the wrong
masqueraded host. If this happens the masqueraded host receiving the
traffic in error will discard it because it has an unexpected SPI value,
and everybody will eventually time out, rekey and try again. This can be
addressed by editing <CODE>/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/ip_masq.c</CODE>
(<CODE>ip_masq_ipsec.c</CODE> in 2.2.x) and increasing the INIT lifetime or the
number of INIT retries permitted, at the cost of increasing the blocking
(and DoS) window.

</LI>
<LI>Sessions idle or semi-idle (with infrequent inbound traffic and
no outbound traffic) for a long period of time may be idle long enough for
the masq table entry to expire. If the remote host sends traffic to an
established yet masq-expired session while an outstanding init to the same
remote host is underway, the traffic may be misrouted for the same reason
as described above. This can be addressed by making sure the <CODE>IPsec Masq
Table Lifetime</CODE> kernel configuration parameter is slightly longer than the
rekey interval, which is the longest time any given SPI pair should be used.
The problem here is that you may not know all of the rekey intervals if
you're masquerading for many remote servers, or some may have their rekey
intervals set to unreasonably high values, such as several hours.

</LI>
<LI>If there is a delay between a rekey and the transmission of outbound
ESP traffic using the new SPI, and during this delay inbound ESP traffic
using the new SPI is received, there will be no masq table entry describing
how to route the inbound traffic. If another masqueraded host has a pending
init with the same remote host, the traffic will be misassociated. Note
that serialization of ESP initial traffic <EM>does not</EM> affect ISAKMP
rekey traffic.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The best solution is to have some way to preload the masq table with the
properly associated out-SPI/in-SPI pair or some other mapping of
remote_host + inbound_SPI to masqueraded_host. This cannot be done by
inspecting the ISAKMP key exchange, as it is encrypted. It may be possible
to use RSIP (a.k.a. Host-NAT) to communicate with the masqueraded IPsec
host and request notification of SPI information once it has been
negotiated. This is being investigated. If something is done to implement
this it will be done no sooner than the 2.3.x series, as RSIP is a fairly
complex client/server NAT protocol.</P>
<P>When an inbound ESP packet with a new SPI is received the masquerading
firewall attempts to guess which masqueraded host(s) the unassociated
inbound traffic is intended for. If the inbound ESP traffic is not matched
to an established session or a pending session initialization, then the
packet is sent to the masqueraded host(s) who most recently rekeyed with
that remote host. The &#34;incorrect&#34; masqueraded hosts will discard
the traffic as being improperly encrypted, and the &#34;correct&#34; host
will get its data. When the &#34;correct&#34; host responds, the normal
ESP init serialization process occurs.</P>
