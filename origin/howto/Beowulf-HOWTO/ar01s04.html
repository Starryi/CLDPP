Choose the most powerful box to be the head
    node. Install Linux there and choose every package you want. The only
    requirement is that you choose "Network Servers" [in Red Hat terminology]
    because you need to have NFS and ssh. That's all you need. In my case, I
    was going to do development of the Beowulf application, so I added X and C
    development.</p><p>It is my experience that you do not actually need NFS, but I found
    it invaluable for copying files between nodes, and for automating the
    install process. Later in this document I will describe how you can run a
    simple Beowulf application without the use of NFS, but a more complex
    application may use NFS or actually depend upon it.</p><p>Those of you researching Beowulf systems will also know how you can
    have a second network card on the head node so you can access it from the
    outside world. This is not required for the operation of a cluster.</p><p>I learned the hard way: use a password that obeys the strong
    password constraints for your Linux distribution. I used an easily typed
    password like "a" for my user, and the whole thing did not work. When I
    changed my password to a legal password, with mixed numbers, characters,
    upper and lower case, it worked.</p><p>If you use lam as your message passing interface, you will read in
    the manual to turn OFF the firewalls, because they use random port numbers
    to communicate between nodes. Here is a rule: If the manual tells you to
    do something, DO IT! The lam manual also tells you to run as a non-root
    user. Make the same user for every box. Build every box on the cluster
    with that same user and password. I named that non root user "wolf".
    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm77"></a>4.1. Hosts</h3></div></div></div><p>First we modify /etc/hosts. In it, you will see the comments
      telling you to leave the "localhost" line alone. Ignore that advice and
      change it to not include the name of your box in the loopback
      address.</p><p>Modify the line that says: </p><pre class="screen">127.0.0.1 wolf00 localhost.localdomain localhost</pre><p>...to now say: </p><pre class="screen">127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost </pre><p>Then add all the boxes you want on your cluster. Note: This is not
      required for the operation of a Beowulf cluster; only convenient, so
      that you may type a simple "wolf01" when you refer to a box on your
      cluster instead of the more tedious 192.168.0.101:</p><pre class="screen">192.168.0.100 wolf00
192.168.0.101 wolf01
192.168.0.102 wolf02
192.168.0.103 wolf03
192.168.0.104 wolf04</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm86"></a>4.2. Groups</h3></div></div></div><p>In order to responsibly set up your cluster, especially if you are
      a "user" of your boxes [see Definitions], you should have some measure
      of security.</p><p>After you create your user, create a group, and add the user to
      the group. Then, you may modify your files and directories to only be
      accessible by the users within that group:</p><pre class="screen">groupadd beowulf 
usermod -g beowulf wolf </pre><p>...and add the following to /home/wolf/.bash_profile:</p><pre class="screen">umask 007</pre><p>Now any files created by the user "wolf" [or any user within the
      group] will be automatically only writeable by the group
      "beowulf".</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm94"></a>4.3. NFS</h3></div></div></div><p>Refer to the following web site: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO/server.html" target="_top">http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO/server.html</a></p><p>Print that up, and have it at your side. I will be directing you
      how to modify your system in order to create an NFS server, but I have
      found this site invaluable, as you may also.</p><p>Make a directory for everybody to share:</p><pre class="screen">mkdir /mnt/wolf 
chmod 770 /mnt/wolf 
chown wolf:beowulf /mnt/wolf -R </pre><p>Go to the /etc directory, and add your "shared" directory to the
      exports file:</p><pre class="screen">cd /etc 
cat &gt;&gt; exports 
/mnt/wolf 192.168.0.100/192.168.0.255 (rw) 
&lt;control d&gt;</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm103"></a>4.4. IP Addresses</h3></div></div></div><p>My network is 192.168.0.nnn because it is one of the "private" IP
      ranges. Thomas Sterling talks about it on page 106 of his book. It is
      inside my firewall, and works just fine.</p><p>My head node, which I call "wolf00" is 192.168.0.100, and every
      other node is named "wolfnn", with an ip of 192.168.0.100 + nn. I am
      following the sage advice of many of the web pages out there, and
      setting myself up for an easier task of scaling up my cluster.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm107"></a>4.5. Services</h3></div></div></div><p>Make sure that services we want are up:</p><pre class="screen">chkconfig -add sshd 
chkconfig -add nfs 
chkconfig -add rexec 
chkconfig -add rlogin 
chkconfig -level 3 rsh on 
chkconfig -level 3 nfs on 
chkconfig -level 3 rexec on 
chkconfig -level 3 rlogin on</pre><p>...And, during startup, I saw some services that I know I don't
      want, and in my opinion, could be removed. You may add or remove others
      that suit your needs; just include the ones shown above.</p><pre class="screen">chkconfig -del atd 
chkconfig -del rsh
chkconfig -del sendmail</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm113"></a>4.6. SSH</h3></div></div></div><p>To be responsible, we make ssh work. While logged in as root, you
      must modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. The lines:</p><pre class="screen">#RSAAuthentication yes 
#AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys</pre><p>...are commented out, so uncomment them [remove the #].</p><p>Reboot, and log back in as wolf, because the operation of your
      cluster will always be done from the user "wolf". Also, the hosts file
      modifications done earlier must take effect. Logging out and back in
      will not do this. To be sure, reboot the box, and make sure your prompt
      shows hostname "wolf00".</p><p>To generate your public and private SSH keys, do this:</p><pre class="screen">ssh-keygen -b 1024 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N "" </pre><p>...and it will display a few messages, and tell you that it created
      the public / private key pair. You will see these files, id_rsa and
      id_rsa.pub, in the /home/wolf/.ssh directory.</p><p>Copy the id_rsa.pub file into a file called "authorized_keys"
      right there in the .ssh directory. We will be using this file later.
      Verify that the contents of this file show the hostname [the reason we
      rebooted the box]. Modify the security on the files, and the
      directory:</p><pre class="screen">chmod 644 ~/.ssh/auth* 
chmod 755 ~/.ssh </pre><p>According to the LAM user group, only the head node needs to log
      on to the slave nodes; not the other way around. Therefore when we copy
      the public key files, we only copy the head node's key file to each
      slave node, and set up the agent on the head node. This is MUCH easier
      than copying all authorized_keys files to all nodes. I will describe
      this in more detail later.</p><p>Note: I only am documenting what the LAM distribution of the
      message passing interface requires; if you chose another message passing
      interface to build your cluster, your requirements may differ.</p><p>At the end of /home/wolf/.bash_profile, add the following
      statements [again this is lam-specific; your requirements may
      vary]:</p><pre class="screen">export LAMRSH='ssh -x' 
ssh-agent sh -c 'ssh-add &amp;&amp; bash'</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm128"></a>4.7. MPI</h3></div></div></div><p>Lastly, put your message passing interface on the box. As stated
      in 1.2 Requirements, I used lam. You can get lam from here:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/" target="_top">
      http://www.lam-mpi.org/</a></p><p>...but you can use any other message passing interface or parallel
      virtual machine software you want. Again, I am showing you what worked
      for me.</p><p>You can either build LAM from the supplied source, or use their
      precompiled RPM package. It is not in the scope of this document to
      describe that; I just got the source and followed the directions, and in
      another experiment I installed their rpm. Both of them worked fine.
      Remember the whole reason we are doing this is to learn; go forth and
      learn.</p><p>You may also read more documentation regarding LAM and other
      message passing interface software <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Scientific-Computing-with-GNU-Linux/systems.html" target="_top">here.</a></p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3. Requirements </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5. Set Up Slave Nodes</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
