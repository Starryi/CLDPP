Install Linux on the first non-head
    node. Follow these steps for each non-head node.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm140"></a>5.1. Base Linux Install</h3></div></div></div><p>Going with my example node names and IP addresses, this is what I
      chose during setup:</p><pre class="screen">Workstation 
auto partition 
remove all partitions on system 
use LILO as the boot loader 
put boot loader on the MBR 
host name wolf01 
ip address 192.168.0.101 
add the user "wolf"
same password as on all other nodes 
NO firewall</pre><p>The ONLY package installed: network servers. Un-select all other
      packages.</p><p>It doesn't matter what else you choose; this is the minimum that
      you need. Why fill the box up with non-essential software you will never
      use? My research has been concentrated on finding that minimal
      configuration to get up and running.</p><p>Here's another very important point: when you move on to an
      automated install and config, you really will NEVER log in to the box.
      Only during setup and install do I type anything directly on the
      box.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm147"></a>5.2. Hardware</h3></div></div></div><p>When the computer starts up, it will complain if it does not have
      a keyboard connected. I was not able to modify the BIOS, because I had
      older discarded boxes with no documentation, so I just connected a
      "fake" keyboard.</p><p>I am in the computer industry, and see hundreds of keyboards come
      and go, and some occasionally end up in the garbage. I get the old dead
      keyboard out of the garbage, remove JUST the cord with the tiny circuit
      board up there in the corner, where the num lock and caps lock lights
      are. Then I plug the cord in, and the computer thinks it has a complete
      keyboard without incident.</p><p>Again, you would be better off modifying your bios, if you are
      able to. This is just a trick to use in case you don't have the bios
      program.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm152"></a>5.3. Post Install Commands</h3></div></div></div><p>After your newly installed box reboots, log on as root again,
      and...</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>do the same chkconfig commands stated above to set up the

      do NOT do the modification of the exports file.</p><p>Also, do NOT add this line to the .bash_profile:</p><pre class="screen">sh -c 'ssh-add &amp;&amp; bash'</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm173"></a>5.4. SSH On Slave Nodes</h3></div></div></div><p>Recall that on the head node, we created a file "authorized_keys".
      Copy that file, created on your head node, to the ~/.ssh directory on
      the slave nodes. The HEAD node will log on the all the SLAVE
      nodes.</p><p>The requirement, as stated in the LAM user manual, is that there
      should be no interaction required when logging in from the head to any
      of the slaves. So, copying the public key from the head node into each
      slave node, in the file "authorized_keys", tells each slave 
      that "wolf
      user on wolf00 is allowed to log on here without any password; we know
      it is safe."</p><p>However you may recall that the documentation states that the
      first time you log on, it will ask for confirmation. So only once, after
      doing the above configuration, go back to the head node, and type ssh
      wolfnn where "wolfnn" is the name of your newly configured slave node.
      It will ask you for confirmation, and you simply answer "yes" to it, and
      that will be the last time you will have to interact.</p><p>Prove it by logging off, and then ssh back to that node, and it
      should just immediately log you in, with no dialog whatsoever.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm179"></a>5.5. NFS Settings On Slave Nodes</h3></div></div></div><p>As root, enter these commands:</p><pre class="screen">cat &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab 
wolf00:/mnt/wolf /mnt/wolf nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0 
&lt;control d&gt; </pre><p>What we did here was automatically mount the exported directory we
      put in the /etc/exports file on the head node. More discussion regarding
      nfs later in this document.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm184"></a>5.6. Lilo Modifications On Slave Nodes</h3></div></div></div><p>Then modify /etc/lilo.conf.</p><p>The 2nd line of this file says</p><pre class="screen">timeout=nn</pre><p>Modify that line to say:</p><pre class="screen">timeout=1200</pre><p>After it is modified, we invoke the changes. You type
      "/sbin/lilo", and it will display back "added linux *" to confirm that
      it took the changes you made to the lilo.conf file:</p><pre class="screen">/sbin/lilo
Added linux * </pre><p>Why do I do this lilo modification? If you were researching
      Beowulf on the web, and understand everything I have done so far, you
      may wonder, "I don't remember reading anything about lilo.conf."</p><p>All my Beowulf nodes share a single power strip. I turn on the
      power strip, and every box on the cluster starts up immediately. As the
      startup procedure progresses, it mounts file systems. Seeing that the
      non-head nodes mount the shared directory from the head node, they all
      will have to wait a little bit until the head node is up, with NFS ready
      to go. So I make each slave node wait 2 minutes in the lilo step.
      Meanwhile, the head node comes up, and making the shared directory
      available. By then, the slave nodes finally start booting up because
      lilo has waited 2 minutes.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4. Set Up The Head Node </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 6. Verification</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
