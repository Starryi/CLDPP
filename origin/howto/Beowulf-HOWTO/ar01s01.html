    Beowulf cluster. After seeing all of the documentation that was available,
    I felt there were enough gaps and omissions that my own document, which I
    believe accurately describes how to build a Beowulf cluster, would be
    beneficial.</p><p>I first saw Thomas Sterling's article in Scientific American, and
    immediately got the book, because its title was "How to Build a Beowulf".
    No doubt, it was a valuable reference, but it does not walk you through
    instructions on exactly what to do.</p><p>What follows is a description of what I got to work. It is only one
    example - my example. You may choose a different message passing
    interface; you may choose a different Linux distribution. You may also
    spend as much time as I did researching and experimenting, and learn on
    your own.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="copyright"></a>1.1. Copyright and License</h3></div></div></div><p>This document, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Beowulf HOWTO</em></span>, is
