<P>The important flag above is ``e''. Don't fuss if the other flags
look different in your file. Keep your flags as-is, only add ``e''
to your flags according to the above examples, unless it's there
already. ``e'' marks the mailers as ``expensive''.</P>

<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf using m4 source</H3>

<P>In the following I will, for simplicity, assume that the sendmail
version is 8.8.7. If you have a different version, replace 8.8.7
with that version number below! Also, the instructions will not
work for older versions of sendmail. Get the latest sendmail!</P>

<P>Download the sendmail source.
Try ``http://WWW.Sendmail.ORG'' or possibly ``ftp.sendmail.org''.</P>

<P>I also recommend that you obtain my patch for allowing envelope
sender reverse aliasing and other nice stuff to really make you
take control over your mail environment.</P>
<P>Write to ``Sendmail Patch &lt;sendmail@lege.com&gt;'',
Subject: ``sendmail-8.8.7'', if 8.8.7 is your sendmail version.</P>
<P>They are also available from ``http://www.lege.com'', as is
the sgml source of this mini-HOWTO!</P>
<P>You don't have to get my patches in order to get ``Queue Remote
Mail + Deliver Local Mail'' to work. My patches solve other
things. But I just thought this would be a nice place to mention
them, as many Linux users will find them extremely useful.
(They will even give you properly working virtual domains, if you
like. The virtual domains don't have to be ``local''. They will
give you ``xaliases'', or in other words ``reverse aliasing''.)</P>
<P>Unpack the sendmail source. You may get /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/.
cd /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf</P>
<P>Now overlay my patch, if you want it, otherwise skip this step:
If you don't want to use procmail as Local Delivery Agent, save
away your /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/ostype/linux.m4 before
doing this...
Save my patch to ``/tmp/sendmail-8.8.7-cf-cpio-idcmu.gz'', then...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf
gzip -dc &lt; /tmp/sendmail-8.8.7-cf-cpio-idcmu.gz | cpio -idcmu
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you didn't want to use procmail, write back the saved copy of
/usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/ostype/linux.m4 again.</P>
<P>And regardless of if you applied my patch or not, you must make
sure these lines or very similar ones are added to
/usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/cf/yourhostname.smtp.mc
(but if you applied my patch you may want to investigate filenames
containing the word ``elijah'', under /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf):</P>

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Dial-on-demand solutions PART</A></H2>

<P>Written by Jan P Tietze &lt;jptietze@mail.hh.provi.de&gt;.</P>
<P>Many Linux users access the Internet through a dialup line, and many
have decided to implement dial-on-demand facilities on their system.
That is, whenever an IP packet of some sort has to leave the local
network or the local host, the link to an Internet Service Provider
(ISP) will automatically be established. The link will be dropped
after some period of time that no packet has travelled across.</P>
<P>Although this is very comfortable and cost effective, there is one
special case in which this is neither comfortable (as the time to
bring up a &#34;traditional&#34; modem dialup is very noticeable) nor cost
effective, and this is sending e-mail. E-Mail is commonly sent by
SMTP, either delivered by your own system or through a SMTP host on
the Internet that usually resides in your ISP's network.</P>
<P>With dialup lines, every time you send a message the link will have
to be brought up. This is quite okay if you send only one message,
but if you happen to create and send multiple messages, bringing up
the line more than once can be tedious and cost ineffective. Also,
if your ISP imposes limits as to what times you are allowed to
login, this would also restrict you to postpone messages at certain
times of the day, and you would have to manually send them later.</P>
<P>Section 1 of this document will solve the situation, however in
situations where an external DNS lookup would cause the link up, the
link will still be established even if e-mail is just being queued.
The reason is that sendmail wishes to &#34;canonify&#34; host names.</P>
<P>The solution to this problem is twofold: First, we'll have to
moderately change sendmail.cf. And then we have to define the
process of actual mail delivery. Personally, I prefer to have cron
do the job for me and describe the necessary changes below.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Configuring sendmail.cf</A>
</H2>

<P>For the reasons stated in [1.2], I recommend modifying the m4
sources instead of editing sendmail.cf directly. It will actually
save you a lot of hassle and make configuration changes more
verbose.</P>
<P>First, perform all the changes described in the first part of this
document. Then go through the dial-on-demand specific stuff.</P>

<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf directly, for trivial configurations</H3>

<P>Configuring directly is highly impractical and anything but verbose,
but obviously, this is your decision.</P>
<P>Close to very bottom of your sendmail.cf should be a line that
reads:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
R$* &lt; @ $* $~P &gt; $*               $: $1 &lt; @ $[ $2 $3 $] &gt; $4
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Precede that line with a &#34;#&#34; so that it reads</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#R$* &lt; @ $* $~P &gt; $*              $: $1 &lt; @ $[ $2 $3 $] &gt; $4
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf using the m4 source.</H3>

<P>Add the following line to
/usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/cf/yourhostname.smtp.mc:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
FEATURE(nocanonify)dnl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Your final sendmail.cf can then be built by issuing the following
commands. Remember to always back up your old /etc/sendmail.cf
before installing the new one:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cp /etc/sendmail.cf /etc/sendmail.cf.bak
cd /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/cf
m4 yourhostname.smtp.mc &gt; /etc/sendmail.cf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Adding dial delay</A>
</H2>

<P>It is oftentimes useful, especially when using modem lines, to have
a dial delay installed. This means that if sendmail tries to
initiate a connection in an attempt to send an e-mail (and this
causes the line to go up) but the link actually takes more time to
get established than what sendmail thinks should be a reasonable
timeout, sendmail will simply wait some seconds and then retry.</P>

<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf directly</H3>

<P>Somewhere in your sendmail.cf could be a line that would read:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#O DialDelay=10s
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(or very similar). Delete the ``#''. If there's no ``#'' at the
beginning of the line, things should be considered okay (it just
means this had already been enabled before).</P>
<P>If there is no such line in your sendmail.cf, add one (it is a wise
thing to do to add this in the &#34;options&#34; part of the file):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
O DialDelay=10s
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now change the ``10s'' part to the number of seconds you deem
suitable.</P>

<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf using m4 source</H3>

<P>Add the following line to
/usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/cf/yourhostname.smtp.mc:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
define(`confDIAL_DELAY',`10s')
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now change the ``10s'' part to the number of seconds you deem
suitable.</P>
<P>Your final sendmail.cf can then be built by issuing the following
commands. Remember to always back up your old /etc/sendmail.cf
before installing the new one:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cp /etc/sendmail.cf /etc/sendmail.cf.bak
cd /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/cf
m4 yourhostname.smtp.mc &gt; /etc/sendmail.cf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Delivering e-mail</A></H2>

<P>E-Mail delivery can be invoked by issuing the command &#34;sendmail -q&#34;.
For those who are interested in what sendmail actually does,
&#34;sendmail -q -v&#34; will give a more verbose version of the delivery
process.</P>
<P>It is very convenient to automate the process of e-mail delivery. A
tool commonly used for this process is cron.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 How to have e-mail delivered at special times.</A>
</H2>

<P>Edit your crontab:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
crontab -e
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Add lines of the form:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
05 18-23,0-7    * * Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri /usr/sbin/sendmail -q
05 *            * * Sat,Sun             /usr/sbin/sendmail -q
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Please refer to the crontab man page (available through &#34;man 5 \
crontab&#34;) for further information. I think the format is pretty
obvious. The example crontab entries shown above send e-mail (if,
and only if, e-mail is available from the queue) 5 minutes after an
hour on weekdays, starting at 6:05 pm, and stopping at 7:05 am.  On
weekends, e-mail is delivered 5 minutes after an hour, starting at
12:05 pm on Saturday, and stopping 11:05 pm on Sunday.</P>
<P>As a dial-on-demand user, it is sometimes desirable to have your
system collect your e-mail via the POP3 protocol at certain times of
the day. You could therefore add an entry similar to the following
to your crontab:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
0 21            * * * popclient -3 -u &lt;your pop3 user name
goes here&gt; -p &lt;put your password here&gt; -o /var/spool/mail/&lt;the user
on your system that should receive the collected e-mail&gt;
&lt;mailhost.somedomain.com&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Of course, this should all go on a single line.</P>
<P>Then, save the file and leave the editor. The crontab should now be
installed.</P>
