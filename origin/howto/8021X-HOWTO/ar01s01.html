    When a new wireless node (WN) requests access to a LAN resource,
    the access point (AP) asks for the WN's identity. <span class="emphasis"><em>No
    other traffic than EAP is allowed before the WN is authenticated
    (the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">port</span>&#8221;</span> is closed).</em></span> 
    </p><p>
    The wireless node that requests authentication is often called
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Supplicant</em></span>, although it is more correct to
    say that the wireless node <span class="emphasis"><em>contains</em></span> a
    Supplicant. The Supplicant is responsible for responding to
    Authenticator data that will establish its credentials. The same
    goes for the access point; the 
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Authenticator is</em></span> not the access point. Rather,
    the access point contains an Authenticator. The Authenticator does
    not even need to be in the access point; it can be an external
    component.
    </p><p>
    EAP, which is the protocol used for authentication, was originally
    used for dial-up PPP. The identity was the username, and either
    PAP or CHAP authentication [<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1994.txt" target="_top">RFC1994</a>] was
    used to check the user's password. Since the identity is sent in
    clear (not encrypted), a malicious sniffer may learn the user's
    identity. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Identity hiding</span>&#8221;</span> is therefore used; the
    real identity is not sent before the encrypted TLS tunnel is up.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    After the identity has been sent, the authentication process
    begins. The protocol used between the Supplicant and the
    Authenticator is EAP, or, more correctly, EAP encapsulation over
    LAN (EAPOL). The Authenticator re-encapsulates the EAP messages to
    RADIUS format, and passes them to the Authentication Server. 
    </p><p>
    During authentication, the Authenticator just relays packets
    between the Supplicant and the Authentication Server. When the
    authentication process finishes, the Authentication Server sends a
    success message (or failure, if the authentication
    failed).<span class="emphasis"><em> The Authenticator then opens the
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">port</span>&#8221;</span> for the Supplicant.</em></span> 
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    After a successful authentication, the Supplicant is granted
    access to other LAN resources/Internet.

  </p><p>
  Why is it called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">port</span>&#8221;</span>-based authentication? The
  Authenticator deals with <span class="emphasis"><em>controlled</em></span> and
  <span class="emphasis"><em>uncontrolled</em></span> ports. Both the controlled and the
  uncontrolled port are logical entities (virtual ports), but use the
  same physical connection to the LAN (same point of attachment).

  802.1X plays a major role in the new IEEE wireless standard 802.11i.

     Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which is part of the original
     802.11 standard, should provide confidentiality. Unfortunately WEP
     is poorly designed and easily cracked. There is no authentication
     mechanism, only a weak form of access control (must have the
     shared key to communicate). Read more <a class="ulink" href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/isaac/wep-faq.html" target="_top">here</a>.
     </p><p>
     As a response to WEP broken security, IEEE has come up with
     a new wireless security standard named 802.11i. 802.1X plays a
     major role in this new standard.
     </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="RSN"></a>1.2.2. 802.11i</h4></div></div></div><p>
     The new security standard, 802.11i, which was ratified in June
     2004, fixes all WEP weaknesses. It is divided into three main
     categories:
     </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
     <span class="emphasis"><em>Temporary Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)</em></span> is
     a short-term solution that fixes all WEP weaknesses. TKIP can be
     used with old 802.11 equipment (after a driver/firmware upgrade)
     and provides integrity and confidentiality.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     <span class="emphasis"><em>Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) [<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3610.txt" target="_top">RFC2610</a>]</em></span>
     is a new protocol, designed from ground up. It uses AES [<a class="ulink" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf" target="_top">FIPS
     197</a>] as its cryptographic algorithm, and, since this is
     more CPU intensive than RC4 (used in WEP and TKIP), new 802.11
     hardware may be required. Some drivers can implement CCMP in
     software. CCMP provides integrity and confidentiality. 
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     <span class="emphasis"><em>802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control:</em></span>
     Either when using TKIP or CCMP, 802.1X is used for
     authentication.
     </p></li></ol></div><p>
     In addition, an optional encryption method called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Wireless
     Robust Authentication Protocol</span>&#8221;</span> (WRAP) may be used instead
     of CCMP. WRAP was the original AES-based proposal for 802.11i, but
     was replaced by CCMP since it became plagued by property
     encumbrances. Support for WRAP is optional, but CCMP support is
     mandatory in 802.11i. 
     </p><p>
     802.11i also has an extended key derivation/management,
     described next.

   To enforce a security policy using encryption and integrity
   algorithms, keys must be obtained. Fortunately, 802.11i implements
   a key derivation/management regime. See figure <a class="link" href="ar01s01.html#keyman">KM</a>.

   For small office / home office (SOHO), ad-hoc networks or home
   usage, a pre-shared key (PSK) may be used. When using PSK, the whole
   802.1X authentication process is elided. This has also been called
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">WPA Personal</span>&#8221;</span> (WPA-PSK), whereas WPA using EAP (and
   RADIUS) is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">WPA Enterprise</span>&#8221;</span> or just
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">WPA</span>&#8221;</span>.
   </p><p>
   The 256-bit PSK is generated from a given password using PBKDFv2
   from [<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt" target="_top">RFC2898</a>], and is
   used as the Master Key (MK) described in the key management regime
   above. It can be one single PSK for the whole network (insecure), or
   one PSK per Supplicant (more secure).

     The industry didn't have time to wait until the 802.11i standard
     was completed. They wanted the WEP issues fixed now! <a class="ulink" href="http://www.wi-fi.org/" target="_top">Wi-Fi Alliance</a> felt the
     pressure, took a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">snapshot</span>&#8221;</span> of the standard
     (based on draft 3), and called it <span class="emphasis"><em>Wi-Fi Protected Access
     (WPA)</em></span>. One requirement was that existing 802.11
     equipment could be used with WPA, so WPA is basically TKIP +
     802.1X.
     </p><p>
     WPA is not the long term solution. To get a <span class="emphasis"><em>Robust
     Secure Network (RSN)</em></span>, the hardware must support and use
     CCMP. RSN is basically CCMP + 802.1X.
     </p><p>
     RSN, which uses TKIP instead of CCMP, is also called Transition
     Security Network (TSN). RSN may also be called WPA2, so that the
     market don't get confused.
     </p><p>
     Confused?

   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3748.txt" target="_top">RFC 3748</a>] is just

   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">
   [EAP is] an authentication framework which supports multiple
   authentication methods. EAP typically runs directly over data link
   layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without
   requiring IP. EAP provides its own support for duplicate
   elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer
   ordering guarantees. Fragmentation is not supported within EAP
