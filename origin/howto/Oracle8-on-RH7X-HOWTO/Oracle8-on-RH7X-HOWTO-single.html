<H1>Oracle 8i on Linux RH7.X Installation HOWTO</H1>

<H2>Krastio Atanassov <CODE>&lt;st201789@educ.di.unito.it&gt;</CODE> ,
and Luca Roversi <CODE>&lt;roversi@di.unito.it&gt;</CODE></H2>v0.1, 2002-07-15
<HR>
<EM>Following this HOWTO you should be able to get "Oracle 8i, version 8.1.7,
Enterprise Edition for Linux" installed on a RedHat 7.X distribution (and, we hope, on distributions based/derived from it.) You will
also have some few hints at how to create a database.
We decide to write this notes because we did not manage to get through the installation, simply following the already existing "Oracle 8 for Linux" HOWTOs,
and Oracle documentation and we found people on the net experiencing our
problems.</EM>

<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What's in here?</A>
</H2>

<P>A sequence of steps that brought us to let Oracle 8i,
and Linux RedHat 7.2 working together.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Who is this HOWTO for?</A>
</H2>

<P>This document is for people who want to install Oracle 8i
version 8.1.7 Enterprise edition on Linux RedHat 7.2. At the time Luca
Roversi tried to combine the twos, he could only find people on the net who was
wandering why previous HOWTOs could not lead them to a successful installation.</P>
<P>We have not yet realized the points where this HOWTO substantially differs from
previous HOWTOs on the same subject; however, it lists operations that seems to 
be correct.</P>

</H2>

<P>At least 800M free on your hard disk. Type:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
bash$ df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda2             5.3G  3.6G  1.4G  72% /
</PRE>
</P>
<P>and read the field Avail.</P>

<H3>Hardware</H3>

<P>The steps we are going to describe allow to have Oracle 8i, version 8.1.7
running on:
<UL>
<LI>a laptop Toshiba Satellite 2800-100 with 128Mb RAM and a 600 Mhz Intel Celeron;</LI>
<LI>others ....</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>In any case, never underestimate Oracle's system prerequisites.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Linux setup</A>
</H2>

<H3>Distribution</H3>

<P>We focus on a Linux RedHat 7.2 distribution, since we had problems 
with it and we wanted to use it. The steps we are going to describe should work
on any Red Hat 7.2 based Linux distribution.</P>

<H3>Distribution Setup</H3>

<P>We assume you have your Linux RedHat 7.2 box installed and working in a
reasonable way for you. In any case, 'base' packages, X Windows (the
installation routine is a Java GUI) and the development tools
regardless of whether you intend doing any coding or not is what you need.</P>

<H3>Setting users and groups</H3>

<P>Login as root:</P>
<P><CODE>$ su - root</CODE></P>
<P>and type whatever password you decided root must have.</P>
<P>Create groups:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
bash# groupadd oinstall
bash# groupadd dba
bash# groupadd oper
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Create oracle user and set its password:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
bash# useradd oracle -g oinstall -G dba,oper
bash# passwd oracle (to change password)
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Installing the right Java Virtual Machine</H3>

<P>The only Java Virtual Machine compatible with Oracle 8i, version 8.1.7, is:
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.dk/mirrors/java-linux/JDK-1.1.8/i386/v3/jdk118_v3-glibc-2.1.3.tar.bz2">ftp://sunsite.dk/mirrors/java-linux/JDK-1.1.8/i386/v3/jdk118_v3-glibc-2.1.3.tar.bz2</A>. <BR>
Do not think: "newer versions will be less 
buggy", as the installer probably won't work. And don't think.</P>
<P>Once downloaded it, move it:</P>
<P><CODE>bash# mv jdk118_v3-glibc-2.1.3.tar.bz2 /usr/local</CODE></P>
<P>untar it:</P>
<P><CODE>bash# tar xvIf jdk118_v3-glibc-2.1.3.tar.bz2</CODE></P>
<P>and create a symbolic link to the folder the command here above has just
created:</P>
<P><CODE>bash# ln -s /usr/local/jdk118_v3 /usr/local/java </CODE></P>

<H3>Kernel parameters</H3>

<P>Oracle documentation suggests that you make changes to the Linux kernel
so you can get more shared memory. 
If you decide to follow that way, keep the instructions in the Oracle 
documentation  and the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Linux Kernel HOWTO</A> at hand to build your
new kernel.</P>

<P>In fact, the required changes can be made by setting some parameter in a
suitable initialization file. Just follow some steps:
<UL>
<LI>
<PRE>
bash# cd /etc
</PRE>

and create a new file <CODE>rc.config</CODE>, if it does not exists.
Inside <CODE>rc.config</CODE> copy the following four lines:
<PRE>
cd /proc/sys/kernel
echo 250 32000 100 128 > sem
echo 4294967295 > shmmax
echo 4096 > shmmni
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>Edit the file <CODE>/etc/rc</CODE> and add the line:
<PRE>
/etc/rc.config
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>In any case, if you want just to start playing with Oracle 8i, version 8.1.7, 
Linux RedHat 7.2 default settings can work fine, and you do not need to set
any kernel parameter, as just described.</P>

<H3>Setting up some libraries</H3>

<P>There may be some compatibility problems between Oracle 8i and gcc versions >=
2.1. If you experience them, download these rpms:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.pawprint.net/linux/compat-egcs-6.2-1.1.2.14.i386.rpm">compat-egcs-6.2-1.1.2.14.i386.rpm</A><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.pawprint.net/linux/compat-glibc-6.2-2.1.3.2.i386.rpm">compat-glibc-6.2-2.1.3.2.i386.rpm</A><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.pawprint.net/linux/compat-libs-6.2-3.i386.rpm">compat-libs-6.2-3.i386.rpm</A><BR></P>
<P>install them, as usual, by:
<PRE>
$ rpm -Uvh compat-egcs-6.2-1.1.2.14.i386.rpm compat-glibc-6.2-2.1.3.2.i386.rpm compat-libs-6.2-3.i386.rpm
</PRE>

and, finally set a symbolic link because there is a small installation bug in
one of the packages just installed:
<PRE>
bash# ln -s /bin/id /usr/bin/id
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Final step</H3>

<P>Reboot your machine and keep reading...</P>

<P>Save the new version of <CODE>.bash_profile</CODE> and re-read it, by issuing:
<PRE>
bash$ source .bash_profile

<P>Finally, if you have not any window manager running, it is time to let it
running.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Starting the installer</A>
</H2>

<P>We shall work under the hypothesis that you want to install cdrom Oracle
distribution. Mount the cdrom with:
<PRE>
bash$ mount /mnt/cdrom
</PRE>

and move to the directory that contains the installer:
<PRE>
bash$ cd /mnt/cdrom/install/linux
</PRE>

Then, launch the installer by:
<PRE>
bash$ ./runInstaller
</PRE>

and follow the steps on the GUI it should appear:
<OL>
<LI>after a first click on <CODE>NEXT</CODE> verify that the proposed path is:
<PRE>
/u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.7
</PRE>

and click <CODE>NEXT</CODE> again;</LI>
<LI>fill in the filed <CODE>Unix Group Name</CODE> with the value:
<PRE>
oinstall
</PRE>

If, for any reasons, this is not your first attempt to install Oracle, you will
not be prompted for the <CODE>Unix Group Name</CODE>. In this case jump to step 4,
below.</LI>
<LI>A pop-up window will ask you to run a script as root user, so, open a terminal
emulator and type in:
<PRE>
bash$ su
bash# cd $ORACLE_HOME
bash# ./orainstRoot.sh
</PRE>

When you're done click <CODE>Retry</CODE> on the pop-up window.
</LI>
<LI>You are now given the option of what to install. Choose
<CODE>Oracle Enterprise Edition</CODE>, and
click <CODE>Next</CODE>.

<P>It should now allow you to choose what you install with much
finer granularity. Unless you're particularly constrained by disk
space or know exactly what you need,  choose
<CODE>Typical</CODE> and click <CODE>Next</CODE>.</P>

</LI>
<LI>When it asks you the <CODE>Global database name</CODE>, if you do not have any
particular needs you can type in <CODE>oracle.localdomain</CODE>.
Also, verify that the values of <CODE>SID</CODE> is set to:
<PRE>
O817DB
</PRE>

Then, click <CODE>Next</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>The next step is to set the location of the database. Type in:
<PRE>
/u01
</PRE>

and click <CODE>Next</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>Finally, you are asked to indicate the location where you put java. 
If you followed our suggestions the path is already:
<PRE>
/usr/local/java
</PRE>

Since it is fine, click <CODE>Next</CODE>, and, then <CODE>Install</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>The installation completes by a pop-up windows that asks you to run a
script as root. If you closed the previously opened terminal open one
again and type:
<PRE>
bash$  su
bash# cd $ORACLE_HOME
bash# ./root.sh
</PRE>


After the script completes, click <CODE>OK</CODE> on the pop-up window.

<LI>The configuration tool that starts is the 
<CODE>Database Configuration Assistant</CODE>. 

<P>It may signal errors like:
<PRE>
ORA-03114: not connected to  ORACLE
</PRE>

The temporary solution is to just click on <CODE>Abort</CODE>. 
These kinds of errors will be recovered in a few!!</P>

<P>When the <CODE>Database Configuration Assistant</CODE> concludes its tasks, just
click on <CODE>Next</CODE> and the installation concludes.</P>

<PRE>
        bash$ mv ./glibc-2.1.3-stubs.tar.gz $ORACLE_HOME
        
</PRE>

and let ORACLE_HOME your working directory:
<PRE>
        bash$ cd  $ORACLE_HOME
        
</PRE>
        </LI>
<LI>uncompress and untar the patch:

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Creating a database</A></H2>

<P>We just typed:
<PRE>
bash$ dbassist
</PRE>

and we played around with the default options. This allowed us to generate an
instance of Oracle 8i we could use for teaching purposes, during an
undergraduate course on the foundational principles of data bases. If you need
more professional-oriented instances, consult other HOWTOs or read Oracle
documentation.</P>

<P>In any case, at this point, what you should be able to do is to let
interactive Oracle sql interpreter SQL*Plus run, by issuing:
<PRE>
bash$ sqlplus
</PRE>

and by choosing one of the following two default account/passwd pairs 
that Oracle creates by default. The first pair is:
<PRE>
user-name:sys
password:change_on_install
</PRE>

while the second is:
<PRE>
user-name:system
password:manager
</PRE>
</P>

<P>However, if you, just for example,  want to connect from/to another machine 
we  address you to other HOWTOs; for example, Stephen Darlington's 
"Oracle for Linux Installation HOWTO" covers this
subjects and gives other useful hints in its final sections.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Final Words</A></H2>

<P>Our goal was to write a short list of steps to have Oracle 8i, version 8.1.7,
running on RedHat 7.2. We think we have gotten to our goal, so we stop here.</P>

<P>We think that it would be nice merge all HOWTOs, related to some Oracle
installation on some Linux distribution could be very helpful. This is not in 
our coming projects. Any volunteer?</P>
