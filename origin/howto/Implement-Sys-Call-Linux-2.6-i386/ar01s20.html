PREAMBLE</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other</p><p>functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to</p><p>assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,</p><p>with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.</p><p>Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way</p><p>to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible</p><p>for modifications made by others.</p><p></p><p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative</p><p>works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It</p><p>complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft</p><p>license designed for free software.</p><p></p><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free</p><p>software, because free software needs free documentation: a free</p><p>program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the</p><p>software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;</p><p>it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or</p><p>whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License</p><p>principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</p><p></p><p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that</p><p>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be</p><p>distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a</p><p>world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that</p><p>work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,</p><p>refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a</p><p>licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you</p><p>copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission</p><p>under copyright law.</p><p></p><p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the</p><p>Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with</p><p>modifications and/or translated into another language.</p><p></p><p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of</p><p>the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the</p><p>publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject</p><p>(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly</p><p>within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a</p><p>textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any</p><p>mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical</p><p>connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,</p><p>commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding</p><p>them.</p><p></p><p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles</p><p>are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice</p><p>that says that the Document is released under this License. If a</p><p>section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not</p><p>allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero</p><p>Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant</p><p>Sections then there are none.</p><p></p><p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,</p><p>as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that</p><p>the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may</p><p>be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p><p></p><p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,</p><p>represented in a format whose specification is available to the</p><p>general public, that is suitable for revising the document</p><p>straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of</p><p>pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available</p><p>drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or</p><p>for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input</p><p>to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file</p><p>format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart</p><p>or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.</p><p>An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount</p><p>of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p><p></p><p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain</p><p>ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML</p><p>or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple</p><p>HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of</p><p>transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats</p><p>include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by</p><p>proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or</p><p>processing tools are not generally available, and the</p><p>machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word</p><p>processors for output purposes only.</p><p></p><p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,</p><p>plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material</p><p>this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in</p><p>formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means</p><p>the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,</p><p>preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p><p></p><p>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose</p><p>title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following</p><p>text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a</p><p>specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",</p><p>"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"</p><p>of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a</p><p>section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</p><p></p><p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which</p><p>states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty</p><p>Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this</p><p>License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other</p><p>implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has</p><p>no effect on the meaning of this License.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. VERBATIM COPYING</p><p></p><p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either</p><p>commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the</p><p>copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies</p><p>to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other</p><p>conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use</p><p>technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further</p><p>copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept</p><p>compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough</p><p>number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p></p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and</p><p>you may publicly display copies.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</p><p></p><p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have</p><p>printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the</p><p>Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the</p><p>copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover</p><p>Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on</p><p>the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify</p><p>you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present</p><p>the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and</p><p>visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.</p><p>Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve</p><p>the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated</p><p>as verbatim copying in other respects.</p><p></p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit</p><p>legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit</p><p>reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent</p><p>pages.</p><p></p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering</p><p>more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent</p><p>copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy</p><p>a computer-network location from which the general network-using</p><p>public has access to download using public-standard network protocols</p><p>a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.</p><p>If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,</p><p>when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure</p><p>that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated</p><p>location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an</p><p>Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that</p><p>edition to the public.</p><p></p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the</p><p>Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give</p><p>them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. MODIFICATIONS</p><p></p><p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under</p><p>the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release</p><p>the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified</p><p>Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution</p><p>and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy</p><p>of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><p></p><p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct</p><p>from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions</p><p>(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section</p><p>of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version</p><p>if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p><p>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities</p><p>responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified</p><p>Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the</p><p>Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),</p><p>unless they release you from this requirement.</p><p>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the</p><p>Modified Version, as the publisher.</p><p>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</p><p>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications</p><p>adjacent to the other copyright notices.</p><p>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice</p><p>giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the</p><p>terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p><p>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections</p><p>and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p><p>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p><p>I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add</p><p>to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and</p><p>publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If</p><p>there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one</p><p>stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as</p><p>given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified</p><p>Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p><p>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for</p><p>public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise</p><p>the network locations given in the Document for previous versions</p><p>it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.</p><p>You may omit a network location for a work that was published at</p><p>least four years before the Document itself, or if the original</p><p>publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p><p>K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",</p><p>Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all</p><p>the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements</p><p>and/or dedications given therein.</p><p>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,</p><p>unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers</p><p>or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</p><p>M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section</p><p>may not be included in the Modified Version.</p><p>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"</p><p>or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p><p>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</p><p></p><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or</p><p>appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material</p><p>copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all</p><p>of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the</p><p>list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.</p><p>These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p><p></p><p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains</p><p>nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various</p><p>parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has</p><p>been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a</p><p>standard.</p><p></p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a</p><p>passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list</p><p>of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of</p><p>Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or</p><p>through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already</p><p>includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or</p><p>by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,</p><p>you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit</p><p>permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p><p></p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License</p><p>give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or</p><p>imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</p><p></p><p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this</p><p>License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified</p><p>versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the</p><p>Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and</p><p>list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its</p><p>license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p><p></p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and</p><p>multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single</p><p>copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but</p><p>different contents, make the title of each such section unique by</p><p>adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original</p><p>author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.</p><p>Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of</p><p>Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p><p></p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"</p><p>in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled</p><p>"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",</p><p>and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections</p><p>Entitled "Endorsements".</p><p></p><p></p><p>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</p><p></p><p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents</p><p>released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this</p><p>License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in</p><p>the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for</p><p>verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p><p></p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute</p><p>it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this</p><p>License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all</p><p>other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p><p></p><p></p><p>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</p><p></p><p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate</p><p>and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or</p><p>distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright</p><p>resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights</p><p>of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.</p><p>When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not</p><p>apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves</p><p>derivative works of the Document.</p><p></p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these</p><p>copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of</p><p>the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on</p><p>covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the</p><p>electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.</p><p>Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole</p><p>aggregate.</p><p></p><p></p><p>8. TRANSLATION</p><p></p><p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may</p><p>distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.</p><p>Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special</p><p>permission from their copyright holders, but you may include</p><p>translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the</p><p>original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a</p><p>translation of this License, and all the license notices in the</p><p>Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include</p><p>the original English version of this License and the original versions</p><p>of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between</p><p>the translation and the original version of this License or a notice</p><p>or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p><p></p><p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",</p><p>"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve</p><p>its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual</p><p>title.</p><p></p><p></p><p>9. TERMINATION</p><p></p><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except</p><p>as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to</p><p>copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will</p><p>automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,</p><p>parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this</p><p>License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</p><p>parties remain in full compliance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</p><p></p><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions</p><p>of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new</p><p>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</p><p>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See</p><p>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p><p></p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.</p><p>If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this</p><p>License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of</p><p>following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or</p><p>of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the</p><p>Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version</p><p>number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not</p><p>as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</p><p></p><p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of</p><p>the License in the document and put the following copyright and</p><p>license notices just after the title page:</p><p></p><p>Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.</p><p>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document</p><p>under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2</p><p>or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;</p><p>with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.</p><p>A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU</p><p>Free Documentation License".</p><p></p><p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,</p><p>replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</p><p></p><p>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the</p><p>Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</p><p></p><p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other</p><p>combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the</p><p>situation.</p><p></p><p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we</p><p>recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of</p><p>free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,</p><p>to permit their use in free software.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s19.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">19. Copyright </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
