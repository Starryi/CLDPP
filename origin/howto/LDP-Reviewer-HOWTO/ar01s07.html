Subsequent updates should increment the version number appropriately. The preferred format is Major.Minor.Bugfix, where each section is an integer.
    Some authors use Alan Cox style versions (for example 1.4pre-3) and some include
    additional information (for example 1.3beta). This is acceptable but not encouraged.
    The most important thing is that we <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> a version
    number so we know which version we are dealing with! Once a document goes through review it should
	 advance in minor or bugfix version number, depending on the amount of change introduced.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><b>License and Legal Notice. </b>A license is required.
