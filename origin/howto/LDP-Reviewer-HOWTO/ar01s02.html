The process will act as a front-end
		quality assurance review for new documentation which is submitted to the LDP. Ideally documents will be reviewed 
		within one week of their submission to the LDP. </p><p>Coordinators of this effort will announce to the list or notify individual review members of new document submissions. 
		The coordinators will try to funnel documents to reviewers who have knowledge in the same technical area 
		as the documentation. If the reviewer is not a technical expert in that particular area and needs technical questions 
		answered, there will be a technical expert designated who will be able to address any 
		technical issues or questions. </p><p>
		Once reviewers have agreed to work on a document, they will have one week to complete the review. If they are
		not able to complete the review within that time frame, they will need to let the coordinator know of their difficulties so
		that the author can be notified of the problem. Because these reviews need 
		to be conducted quickly, there will be times when reviewers will be more able to accept review work.</p><p>When reviewing newly submitted documents, refer to the <a class="xref" href="ar01s05.html" title="5. Technical Accuracy Review">Section 5, &#8220;Technical Accuracy Review&#8221;</a> and 
		<a class="xref" href="ar01s06.html" title="6. Language Review">Section 6, &#8220;Language Review&#8221;</a> portions of this guide for the types of information to verify and correct. 
		As a reviewer, you will need to check the documents out of the CVS
	  <a href="#ftn.ftn-ok-to-return-changes-to-coordinator" class="footnote" name="ftn-ok-to-return-changes-to-coordinator"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>

and make any necessary changes. If changes are
		extensive or if the document has glaringly and fundamentally fatal errors, contact a 
		coordinator and let them know what the problems are. Once changes are made, the reviewer will update the minor 
		version number, add a new entry to the revision history, and include
		their name as an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">editor</span>&#8221;</span> of the document. These
		changes will then be submitted to the CVS, and an original copy will
		be sent to the author of the document if the author does not have
		CVS access.
