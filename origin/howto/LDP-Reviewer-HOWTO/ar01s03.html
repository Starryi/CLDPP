Our goal is to implement
	 a quality management program that makes sure we are supplying up-to-date, accurate, easily read documentation.
	 This process will be ongoing throughout the life of the LDP. Initially, we will try to review all documents currently
	 on the LDP. Once we have made our way through existing documents, we will schedule dates for follow-up reviews.
	 By continually reviewing the documents throughout their life at the LDP, we help make sure readers have
	 the best possible experience with Linux documentation.</p><p>In addition to the primary goal of improving the quality of the documentation itself,
    we will also be gathering data about the collection for storage in some sort of database to
    facilitate the ongoing management of the collection. However, this stage of the review is still being defined; details
	 about the specifics and  how this data will be measured will be added in the future. </p><p>Below are some general guidelines that you should follow before you begin reviewing existing documentation
     for the LDP. Please try to have document reviews completed within two weeks of the time you sign up to review a document.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="picking"></a>3.1. Choosing a Document</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many documents that need review. The most 
		important thing is that you coordinate your work with the other
      reviewers. To coordinate the effort, we have set up a mailing list for reviewers.</p><p>Notify the editor list (instructions for subscribing are at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/mailinfo.html#maillists" target="_top">
      <em class="citetitle">http://www.tldp.org/mailinfo.html#maillists</em></a>)
      before you begin to review a document. We want to make sure your work is directed where
      it is most needed and where it will be most useful. Of course, you may have a particular
      area of expertise and that will dictate your choice to some extent.
      You can ask on the list for an assignment, or you can select one for yourself
      and just let the mailing list know what you're doing.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="licenseissues"></a>3.2. License Issues</h3></div></div></div><p>Make sure you have the legal right to work on the document. If it is licensed
      under a free license that specifically grants such rights, you are fine. If not, you
      need to contact the author and get permission.</p><p>If you do not plan to actually change any of the content, but simply report on
      the document's status, then you don't need permission, regardless of license.
      Of course, it is still polite, and advisable, to write the author anyway.</p><p>If a document is missing a copyright and/or license, it's recommended you advise the
      author to choose and apply one.  More information on licensing is
		available in <a class="xref" href="ar01s07.html" title="7. Metadata and Markup Review">Section 7, &#8220;Metadata and Markup Review&#8221;</a>
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="newversion"></a>3.3. Working With the Latest Version</h3></div></div></div><p>Make sure the copy you are reviewing is the most current.</p><p>If your document includes a URL to an official homepage, visit that page and see if it
      displays the same version number. If you find the same version number, you are fine. If you 
      find a newer version number, write to the author and ask him or her to please submit the newer 
      version to you.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pickatype"></a>3.4. Picking a Review to Conduct</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many different ways a document can be reviewed, and you may have the skills
      to do only one or two types of reviews. It is sometimes useful (and easier) to do each review as a
      separate pass through the document; Your Mileage May Vary.</p><p>The following sections explain the various types of reviews we are conducting. Use these sections as a guide to help you choose 
		the type of review to conduct and to help you conduct the review itself. Again, when you post your review
		choice to the review list, please specify the type of review you would like to be responsible for.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2. Reviewing Newly Submitted Documentation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 4. Peer Review</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
