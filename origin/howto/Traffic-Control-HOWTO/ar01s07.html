    The flexibility and control of Linux traffic control can be unleashed
    through the agency of the classful qdiscs.  Remember that the classful
    queuing disciplines can have filters attached to them, allowing packets to
    be directed to particular classes and subqueues.
  </p><p>
    There are several common terms to describe classes directly attached to
    the <code class="constant">root</code> qdisc and terminal classes.  Classess attached to the
    <code class="constant">root</code> qdisc are known as root classes, and more generically inner
    classes.  Any terminal class in a particular queuing discipline is known
    as a leaf class by analogy to the tree structure of the classes.  Besides
    the use of figurative language depicting the structure as a tree, the
    language of family relationships is also quite common.
  </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="qc-htb"></a>7.1. HTB, Hierarchical Token Bucket</h3></div></div></div><p>
        HTB is meant as a more understandable and intuitive replacement for the CBQ (<a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#qc-cbq" title="7.4. CBQ, Class Based Queuing (CBQ)">see chapter 7.4</a>) qdisc in Linux. Both CBQ and HTB help you to control the use of the outbound bandwidth on a given link. Both allow you to use one physical link to simulate several slower links and to send  different  kinds  oftraffic  on different simulated links. In both cases, you have to specify how to divide the physical link into simulated  links  and  how  to decide which simulated link to use for a given packet to be sent.
    </p><p>
      HTB uses the concepts of tokens and buckets
      along with the class-based system and <a class="link" href="ar01s04.html#c-filter" title="4.3. filter"><code class="constant">filter</code></a>s to allow for
      complex and granular control over traffic.  With a complex
      <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#qc-htb-borrowing" title="7.1.3. Borrowing">borrowing model</a>, HTB can perform a variety of sophisticated
      traffic control techniques.  One of the easiest ways to use HTB
      immediately is that of <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#qc-htb-borrowing" title="7.1.3. Borrowing">shaping</a>.
    </p><p>
      By understanding <a class="link" href="ar01s02.html#o-tokens" title="2.7. Tokens and buckets">tokens</a> and <a class="link" href="ar01s02.html#o-buckets">buckets</a> or by grasping
      the function of <a class="link" href="ar01s06.html#qs-tbf" title="6.7. TBF, Token Bucket Filter">TBF</a>, HTB should be merely a logical
      step.  This queuing discipline allows the user to define the
      characteristics of the tokens and bucket used and allows the user to
      nest these buckets in an arbitrary fashion.  When coupled with a
      <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#e-classifying" title="3.3. Classifying">classifying</a> scheme, traffic can be controlled in a very
      granular fashion.

        Unlike almost all of the other software discussed, HTB is a
        newer queuing discipline and your distribution may not have all of the
        tools and capability you need to use HTB.  The kernel must
        support HTB; kernel version 2.4.20 and later support it in the
        stock distribution, although earlier kernel versions require patching.
        To enable userland support for HTB, see <a class="ulink" href="http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/" target="_top">HTB</a> for an
        <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> patch to <span class="command"><strong>tc</strong></span>.

        One of the most common applications of HTB involves shaping
        transmitted traffic to a specific rate.
      </p><p>
        All shaping occurs in leaf classes.  No shaping occurs in inner or
        root classes as they only exist to suggest how the
        <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#qc-htb-borrowing" title="7.1.3. Borrowing">borrowing model</a> should distribute available tokens.

        A fundamental part of the HTB qdisc is the borrowing mechanism.
        Children classes borrow tokens from their parents once they have
        exceeded <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#vl-qc-htb-params-rate"><em class="parameter"><code>rate</code></em></a>.  A child class will continue to
        attempt to borrow until it reaches <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#vl-qc-htb-params-ceil"><em class="parameter"><code>ceil</code></em></a>, at which
        point it will begin to queue packets for transmission until more
        tokens/ctokens are available.  As there are only two primary types of
        classes which can be created with HTB the following table and
        diagram identify the various possible states and the behaviour of the
        borrowing mechanisms.

        This diagram identifies the flow of borrowed tokens and the manner in
        which tokens are charged to parent classes.  In order for the
        borrowing model to work, each class must have an accurate count of the
        number of tokens used by itself and all of its children.  For this
        reason, any token used in a child or leaf class is charged to each
        parent class until the root class is reached.
      </p><p>
        Any child class which wishes to borrow a token will request a token
        from its parent class, which if it is also over its <em class="parameter"><code>rate</code></em> will
        request to borrow from its parent class until either a token is
        located or the root class is reached.  So the borrowing of tokens
        flows toward the leaf classes and the charging of the usage of tokens
        flows toward the root class.

        Below are some general guidelines to using HTB culled from
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.docum.org/docum.org/" target="_top">http://www.docum.org/docum.org/</a> and the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/lartc/" target="_top">(new) LARTC

        <a class="ulink" href="http://mailman.ds9a.nl/mailman/listinfo/lartc/" target="_top">(old) LARTC
         mailing list archive</a>).  These rules are
        simply a recommendation for beginners to maximize the benefit of
        HTB until gaining a better understanding of the practical
        application of HTB.

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Shaping with HTB occurs only in leaf classes.  See also
            <a class="xref" href="ar01s07.html#qc-htb-shaping" title="7.1.2. Shaping">Section 7.1.2, &#8220;Shaping&#8221;</a>.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Because HTB does not shape in any class except the leaf
            class, the sum of the <em class="parameter"><code>rate</code></em>s of leaf classes should not
            exceed the <em class="parameter"><code>ceil</code></em> of a parent class.  Ideally, the sum of
            the <em class="parameter"><code>rate</code></em>s of the children classes would match the
            <em class="parameter"><code>rate</code></em> of the parent class, allowing the parent class to
            distribute leftover bandwidth (<em class="parameter"><code>ceil</code></em> - <em class="parameter"><code>rate</code></em>) among
            the children classes.
          </p><p>
            This key concept in employing HTB bears repeating.  Only
            leaf classes actually shape packets; packets are only delayed in
            these leaf classes.  The inner classes (all the way up to the root
            class) exist to define how borrowing/lending occurs (see also
            <a class="xref" href="ar01s07.html#qc-htb-borrowing" title="7.1.3. Borrowing">Section 7.1.3, &#8220;Borrowing&#8221;</a>).

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The <em class="parameter"><code>quantum</code></em> should be set at MTU or higher.  HTB

            able to calculate accurately the real bandwidth consumed

            Parent classes lend tokens to children in increments of

            should be as low as possible while still no less than MTU.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A distinction between tokens and ctokens is only meaningful in a

            Like see before, within the one HTB instance many classes may exist. Each of these classes contains another qdisc, by default <a class="link" href="ar01s06.html#qs-fifo" title="6.1. FIFO, First-In First-Out (pfifo and bfifo)">tc-pfifo</a>.When enqueueing a packet, HTB starts at the root and uses various methods to determine which class should receive the data. In the absence of uncommon configuration options, the process is rather easy.  At each node we look for an instruction,  and  then  go  to  the class  the  instruction  refers  us  to. If the class found is a barren leaf-node (without children), we enqueue the packet there. If it is not yet a leaf node, we do the whole thing over again starting from that node.

            The following actions are performed, in order at each node we visit, until one sends us to another node, or terminates the process.

      The PRIO classful qdisc works on a very simple precept.  When it
      is ready to dequeue a packet, the first class is checked for a packet.
      If there's a packet, it gets dequeued.  If there's no packet, then the
      next class is checked, until the queuing mechanism has no more classes
      to check. PRIO is a scheduler and never delays packets - it is a work-conserving  qdisc, though the qdiscs contained in the classes may not be
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="qc-prio-algorithm"></a>7.3.1. Algorithm</h4></div></div></div><p>
        On creation with <span class="command"><strong>tc qdisc add</strong></span>, a fixed number of
        bands is created.  Each band is a class, although is not possible to
        add classes with <span class="command"><strong>tc class add</strong></span>.  The number of bands
        to be created is fixed at the creation of the qdisc itself.
    </p><p>
        When dequeueing packets, band 0 is always checked first.  If it
        has no packet to dequeue, then PRIO will try band 1, and so
        onwards.  Maximum reliability packets should therefore go to band 0,
        minimum delay to band 1 and the rest to band 2.
    </p><p>
        As the PRIO qdisc itself will have minor number 0, band 0 is  actually major:1, band 1 is major:2, etc. For major, substitute the major number assigned to the qdisc on 'tc qdisc add' with the handle parameter.

      Class Based Queuing (<acronym class="acronym">CBQ</acronym>) is the classic
      implementation (also called venerable) of a traffic control system.  CBQ
      is a classful qdisc that implements a rich link sharing hierarchy of
      classes.  It contains shaping elements as well as prioritizing
      capabilities.  Shaping is performed by calculating link idle time
      based on the timing of dequeue events and knowledge of the underlying
      link layer bandwidth.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="qc-cbq-shaping"></a>7.4.1. Shaping Algorithm</h4></div></div></div><p>
            Shaping is done using link idle time calculations, and actions taken if these calculations deviate from set limits.
        </p><p>
            When shaping a 10mbit/s connection to 1mbit/s, the link will be idle 90% of the time. If it isn't, it needs to be throttled so that it is idle 90% of the time.
        </p><p>
            From the kernel's perspective, this is hard to measure, so CBQ instead computes idle time from the number of microseconds that elapse between requests from the device driver for more data.  Combined with the knowledge of packet sizes, this is used to approximate how full or empty the link is.
        </p><p>
            This is rather circumspect and doesn't always arrive at proper results. The physical link bandwidth may be ill defined in case of not-quite-real network devices like PPP over Ethernet or PPTP over TCP/IP. The effective bandwidth in that case is probably determined by the efficiency of pipes to userspace - which not defined.
        </p><p>
            During operations, the effective idletime is measured using an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA).  This calculation of activity against idleness values recent packets exponentially more than predecessors.  The EWMA is an effective calculation to deal with the problem that a system is either active or inactive.  For example, the Unix system load average is calculated in the same way.
        </p><p>
            The calculated idle time is subtracted from the EWMA measured one, the resulting number is called 'avgidle'. A perfectly loaded link has an avgidle of zero: packets arrive exactly at the calculated interval.
        </p><p>
            An overloaded link has a negative avgidle and if it gets too negative, CBQ throttles and is then 'overlimit'. Conversely, an idle link might amass a huge avgidle, which would then allow infinite bandwidths after a few  hours  of silence.  To  prevent this, avgidle is capped at maxidle.
        </p><p>
            If  overlimit, in theory, the CBQ could throttle itself for exactly the amount of time that was calculated to pass between packets, and then pass one packet, and throttle again. Due to timer resolution constraints, this may not be feasible, see the minburst parameter below.

            When enqueueing a packet, CBQ starts at the root and uses various methods to determine which class should receive the data. If a verdict is reached, this process is repeated for the recipient class which might have further means of classifying traffic to its children, if any. CBQ has the following methods available to classify  a  packet  to  any child classes.

            The packet is enqueued to the class which was chosen when either  algorithm  terminated. It is therefore possible for a packet to be enqueued not at a leaf node, but in the middle of the hierarchy.

            When dequeuing for sending to the network device, CBQ decides which of its  classes  will be allowed to send. It does so with a Weighted Round Robin process in which each class with packets gets a chance to send in turn.  The WRR  process  starts by asking the highest priority classes (lowest numerically - highest semantically) for packets, and will  continue to do so until they have no more data to offer, in which case the process repeats for lower priorities.
        </p><p>
            Each class is not allowed to send at length  though,  they  can  only dequeue a configurable amount of data during each round.
        </p><p>
            If a class is about to go overlimit, and it is not bounded it will try to borrow avgidle from siblings that are not isolated.  This process is repeated from the bottom upwards. If a class is unable to borrow enough avgidle to send a packet, it is throttled and not asked  for  a  packet for enough time for the avgidle to increase above zero.

                the cell size determines the granularity of packet

                when  dequeuing to the lower layer, classes are tried for

                configured qdisc will generally have more traffic to offer
                during each round, so it makes sense to allow it to dequeue
                more traffic. All weights under a class are normalized, so
                only the ratios matter.  Defaults to the configured rate,

                allot specifies how many bytes a qdisc can dequeue during

                maximum aggregated rate at which this class (children

                this is different from the bandwidth specified when creating a

                <code class="constant">bandwidth</code> parameter is only used to
                determine maxidle and offtime, which, in turn, are only
                calculated when specifying maxburst or minburst.  Thus, this
                parameter is only required if specifying
                <code class="constant">maxburst</code> or

                this number of packets is used to calculate maxidle so that
                when avgidle  is  at  maxidle,  this number of average packets
                can be burst before avgidle drops to 0. Set it higher to be
                more tolerant  of  bursts.  You can't set maxidle directly,

                    as mentioned before, CBQ needs to throttle in case of
                    overlimit. The  ideal  solution is to do so for exactly
                    the calculated idle time, and pass 1 packet. However, Unix
                    kernels generally have  a hard  time  scheduling events
                    shorter than 10ms, so it is better to throttle for a
                    longer period, and then pass minburst  packets in one go,
                    and then sleep minburst times longer. The  time  to  wait
                    is called the offtime. Higher values of minburst lead to
                    more accurate shaping in the  long  term,  but  to bigger
                    bursts at millisecond timescales.

                    <span class="emphasis"><em>minidle:</em></span> if  avgidle is below 0, we are overlimits and need to wait until avgidle will be big enough to send one packet. To prevent a sudden burst from shutting down the link for a prolonged period of time, avgidle is reset to minidle if it gets too low.  Minidle is specified in negative microseconds, so 10 means  that avgidle is capped at -10us.

                    or it will consider itself <code class="constant">bounded</code>.

                    <span class="emphasis"><em>split major:minor and defmap bitmap[/bitmap]:</em></span> if consulting filters attached to a class did not  give  a  verdict,  CBQ  can  also  classify  based on the packet's priority.

The Least Significant Bit corresponds to priority zero. The split parameter tells CBQ at  which class the decision must be made, which should be a (grand)parent of the class you are adding.

This again is a EWMA, for which the time constant can  be  specified, also in microseconds. The time constant corresponds to the sluggishness of the measurement or, conversely, to  the  sensitivity of  the  average to short bursts. Higher values mean less sensitivity.

          This qdisc is not included in the standard kernels.
      </p><p>
          The WRR qdisc distributes bandwidth between its classes using the weighted round robin scheme. That is, like the CBQ qdisc it contains classes into which arbitrary qdiscs can be plugged. All classes which have sufficient demand will get bandwidth proportional to the weights associated with the classes. The weights can be set manually using the tc program. But they can also be made automatically decreasing for classes transferring much data.
      </p><p>
          The qdisc has a built-in classifier which assigns packets coming from or sent to different machines to different classes. Either the MAC or IP and either source or destination addresses can be used. The MAC address can only be used when the Linux box is acting as an ethernet bridge, however. The classes are automatically assigned to machines based on the packets seen.
      </p><p>
          The qdisc can be very useful at sites where a lot of unrelated individuals share an Internet connection. A set of scripts setting up a relevant behavior for such a site is a central part of the WRR distribution.

                HTB will report bandwidth usage in this scenario

                This can skew results quickly.
