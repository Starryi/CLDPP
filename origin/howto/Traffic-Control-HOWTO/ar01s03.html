      Shapers delay packets to meet a desired rate.
    </p><p>
      Shaping is the mechanism by which packets are delayed before
      transmission in an output queue to meet a desired output rate.  This is
      one of the most common desires of users seeking bandwidth control
      solutions.  The act of delaying a packet as part of a traffic control
      solution makes every shaping mechanism into a non-work-conserving
      mechanism, meaning roughly:  "Work is required in order to delay
      packets."
    </p><p>
      Viewed in reverse, a non-work-conserving queuing mechanism is performing
      a shaping function.  A work-conserving queuing mechanism (see
      <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#qc-prio" title="7.3. PRIO, priority scheduler">PRIO</a>) would not be capable of delaying a packet.
    </p><p>
      Shapers attempt to limit or ration traffic to meet but not exceed a
      configured rate (frequently measured in packets per second or bits/bytes
      per second).  As a side effect, shapers can smooth out bursty traffic
      <a href="#ftn.idm412" class="footnote" name="idm412"><sup class="footnote">[4]</sup></a>.
      One of the advantages of shaping bandwidth is the ability to control
      latency of packets.  The underlying mechanism for shaping to a rate is
      typically a token and bucket mechanism.  See also
      <a class="xref" href="ar01s02.html#o-tokens" title="2.7. Tokens and buckets">Section 2.7, &#8220;Tokens and buckets&#8221;</a> for further detail on tokens and buckets.

      Schedulers arrange and/or rearrange packets for output.
    </p><p>
      Scheduling is the mechanism by which packets are arranged (or
      rearranged) between input and output of a particular queue.  The
      overwhelmingly most common scheduler is the FIFO (first-in first-out)
      scheduler.  From a larger perspective, any set of traffic control
      mechanisms on an output queue can be regarded as a scheduler, because
      packets are arranged for output.
    </p><p>
      Other generic scheduling mechanisms attempt to compensate for various
      networking conditions.  A fair queuing algorithm (see <a class="link" href="ar01s06.html#qs-sfq" title="6.3. SFQ, Stochastic Fair Queuing">SFQ</a>)
      attempts to prevent any single client or flow from dominating the
      network usage.  A round-robin algorithm (see <a class="link" href="ar01s07.html#qc-wrr" title="7.5. WRR, Weighted Round Robin">WRR</a>) gives each
      flow or client a turn to dequeue packets.  Other sophisticated
      scheduling algorithms attempt to prevent backbone overload (see
      <a class="link" href="ar01s06.html#qs-gred" title="6.6. GRED, Generic Random Early Drop">GRED</a>) or refine other scheduling mechanisms (see
      <a class="link" href="ar01s06.html#qs-esfq" title="6.4. ESFQ, Extended Stochastic Fair Queuing">ESFQ</a>).

      Classifiers sort or separate traffic into queues.
    </p><p>
      Classifying is the mechanism by which packets are separated for
      different treatment, possibly different output queues.  During the
      process of accepting, routing and transmitting a packet, a networking
      device can classify the packet a number of different ways.
      Classification can include
      <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#e-marking" title="3.6. Marking">marking</a> the packet, which usually
      happens on the boundary of a network under a single administrative
      control or classification can occur on each hop individually.
    </p><p>
      The Linux model (see
      <a class="xref" href="ar01s04.html#c-filter" title="4.3. filter">Section 4.3, &#8220;<code class="constant">filter</code>&#8221;</a>) allows for a packet to cascade across a
      series of classifiers in a traffic control structure and to be
      classified in conjunction with
      <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#e-policing" title="3.4. Policing">policers</a> (see also
      <a class="xref" href="ar01s04.html#c-police" title="4.5. policer">Section 4.5, &#8220;policer&#8221;</a>).

      Policers measure and limit traffic in a particular queue.
    </p><p>
      Policing, as an element of traffic control, is simply
      a mechanism by which traffic can be limited.  Policing is most
      frequently used on the network border to ensure that a peer is not
      consuming more than its allocated bandwidth.  A policer will accept
      traffic to a certain rate, and then perform an action on traffic
      exceeding this rate.  A rather harsh solution is to
      <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#e-dropping" title="3.5. Dropping">drop</a> the traffic, although the
      traffic could be
      <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#e-classifying" title="3.3. Classifying">reclassified</a> instead of being
      dropped.
    </p><p>
      A policer is a yes/no question about the rate at which traffic is
      entering a queue.  If the packet is about to enter a queue below a given
      rate, take one action (allow the enqueuing).  If the packet is about to
      enter a queue above a given rate, take another action.  Although the
      policer uses a token bucket mechanism internally, it does not have the
      capability to delay a packet as a <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#e-shaping" title="3.1. Shaping">shaping</a> mechanism does.

      Dropping discards an entire packet, flow or classification.

      Dropping a packet is a mechanism by which a packet is discarded.
