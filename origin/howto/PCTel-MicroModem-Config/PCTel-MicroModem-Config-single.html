>First let me explain what is so "special" about these PCTel modems that made me write this guide.
These modems fall in a special class of hardware, specifically made for M$-Windows systems, and have device
drivers which are specific for  M$-Windows ...These modems are also called  "Winmodems" and are
one of the most troublesome pieces of hardwares for GNU/Linux. Most of the winmodems do not work
with GNU/Linux (the manufacturers use patented technologies and so drivers for these modems cannot be
developed as Open Source). For a few of these winmodems, drivers have been developed </P

modems belong to this category and fall under linmodems. </P

>Please do note that PCTel provides proprietary drivers, and in the free world of GNU/Linux, proprietary drivers
are not the solution. These drivers can turn out to be a great threat as the Free Software Movement evolves and 
matures. So, at the very beginning, please consider whether you want to surrender your "freedom" to PCTel, or
whether you want to go out and buy a new modem which has a GPL'ed driver. I understand, that for many, buying
a new modem is not possible, and hence, this doc exists. But whatever you do, please do send a mail to
Mr. Jack Seller of PCTel's Public Relation department at <A

don't have a smp/uniprocessor mismatch ( that is, running uniprocessor kernel but having a kernel
source with smp support in /usr/src/linux). Also, you will need a kernel
which supports loadable modules.</P

If you get a error message, or if you fail to get any response from minicom proceed to the troubleshooting section.
If everything is all right up to now, you can go ahead to configure your dialer software and connect to
the internet, and please do take some time to submit your modem information to the compatibility database at <A

The process of adding the ATX3 init string varies depending on the dialer you are using.
For example, if you are using <SPAN

>wvdial</SPAN
>, you need to add X3 at the end
of the <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Init2</SAMP
> line in the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/wvdial.conf</TT
>. 
On the other hand, if you are using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KPPP</SPAN
>, you will have to add ATX3 in 
the <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Initialization String 1</SAMP
> field, which can be found in the 
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Modem Commands</SAMP
> section of the <SAMP

gently pull out the modem from it's slot (only if it is <EM

>very very careful </EM

>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P

>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that

    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these

    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes

    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or

    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</P

>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</P

><P
>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</P
><P
>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</P
><P
>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</P

    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of

>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</P

>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</P

    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
