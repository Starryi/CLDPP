In the last decade of the past millennium, I moved out of my parents' house
and into a small apartment with my girlfriend. I left behind not only the
comfort of a magically refilling refrigerator, but also a computer network
that suddenly had to survive daily and sometimes creative usage by my mom,
dad, and kid sister for months without me. After some gentle persuasion, my
girlfriend not only switched from Windows to Linux, but also became my
fiancee. I left grad school and got a real job, which left me with even
less time to fool around even with my &#8212; er, <span class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> &#8212; network, let alone my
parents' computers. My fiancee became my wife, we left the apartment for a
small house, and then I found myself spending more time changing diapers
than floppies.
</p><p>
In other words, somewhere along the way, I turned into an adult.
</p><p>
It happens to the best of us, I'm told, and there are benefits that go
beyond a <span class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> unlimited budget for ice cream.  Having all the time in
the world to keep computers running, however, is not one of them. I needed
some sort of setup for the systems I am responsible for that is
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Easy to administer.</strong></span> I don't have the time to do the same thing on three
different machines, or figure out which machine needs which patch. Ideally,
I only have to take care of one single computer in each network, and that
infrequently. Some of the computers should not require <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> maintenance at
all for months at a time.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Easy to afford.</strong></span> My hardware budget now competes with house payments, food
bills, and the cost of clothes that my daughter seems to grow out of faster
than we can buy them. Getting more done with less is not just an
intellectual challenge, but a pressing necessity.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Easy to secure.</strong></span> The network's very structure should make it harder for
outsiders to do evil things, and, more important, make it easy for me to
create a safe "lock-down" state where threats are minimal
until I find the time to patch holes.
</p><p>
After a few years of trial and error and a lot of time spent thinking about
setting up computers while rocking screaming babies in the middle of the
night, I created a "standard" setup. It is not a terribly clever or
ingenious way of doing things, and there are probably thousands of systems
out there organized along exactly the same lines.  The aim of this text is
to present this setup in a coherent form so that other people don't have to
invent the wheel all over again when faced with the same problem.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm61"></a>2.2. Reasoning and Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>
Most desktop computers nowadays are insanely overpowered for what they are
doing most of the time: Email, surfing, and text processing, while maybe
listening to music.  Unless you are still using a 486DX at 66 MHz, your
processor is probably bored out of its registers even if it is doing all of
this at once. Check any program that shows the system load &#8212; such as
<code class="literal">xload</code>, <code class="literal">top</code>, or <code class="literal">uptime</code> &#8212; and you'll see just how much of your
expensive hardware is busy doing nothing.
</p><p>
With all of those resources left over, there is no technical reason why
more than one person can't use the computer at the same time. This concept
seems strange and downright alien to most home users today, thanks in no
small part to Microsoft's philosophy of "a computer on every desktop" and
the hardware companies' ad campaigns that imply that you are, among other
things, sexually inadequate if you don't have your very own super-charged
computer under your desk.
</p><p>
There are good commercial reasons for hard- and software companies not to
like <span class="emphasis"><em>multiuser</em></span> setups. Even if you have to upgrade the central machine,
you are going to need less high-quality hardware than if everybody has
their own computer; and if four people could use one Windows machine at the
same time, that would be three copies less for Microsoft to make money on.
You obviously don't save money if you just install Linux on one machine
instead on four, but your hardware costs and administration time will drop.
</p><p>
Of course there are other reasons than big company ad pressure why few
people have multiuser setups.  One is computer games: Many of them suck up
so much hardware that a multiuser-system is usually not the best idea.
Also, until a short time ago, there was no easy way to actually have more
than one person log on, since most desktop computers come with only one
keyboard, one mouse, and one monitor.  This has changed: You can now create
inexpensive and reliable graphic terminals (also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>thin clients</em></span>)
with very little hassle and expense. This allows us to get away with one
big machine and a couple of little ones. Last but not least, sharing a
machine means you have to behave and get along with other users.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, this text is about <span class="emphasis"><em>centralizing small computer systems to save time and money</em></span>. The mainframe vendor IBM wants us to believe that
this is just what the big boys are doing, too.  Now that the age of server
mania is over, they say, companies are moving stuff back onto those
mainframes.  Since more and more of those mainframes are running roughly
the same Linux you have at home, the only difference between a real
mainframe and your computer is a bit of hardware. A few hundred thousand
dollars worth of hardware at least, granted, but that doesn't mean that you
can't use the same design principle and enjoy the benefits of a "little"
mainframe &#8212; a "mock" mainframe, if you will.
</p><p>
The basic setup has three parts:
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Mock Mainframe</strong></span>. The one and only core machine. All users access this
computer, either by sitting in front of it or (more likely) from a
terminal, and they can do so at the same time. In the simplest setup, this
machine is home to all users, holds all files, and runs all programs.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>The Terminals.</strong></span> What the user actually touches. Cheap, easy to maintain,
and expendable, they can be dual-boot machines, Linux Terminals, thin
clients, or even X Window server programs for other operating systems.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Support Machines.</strong></span> Optional computers that perform a special task that for
reasons of security or performance you'd rather not have on the mock
mainframe. The most common support machine is a "guardian" that handles
Internet connections.
</p><p>
Parts of this text will deal with installing software that is covered in
far greater detail in other Linux HOWTOs.  Caught between the extremes of
just referring to those texts and copying everything, I have decided to
give a very brief description of the installation procedure on a standard
system.  You'll get a general idea of what needs to be done, but for the
details, you'll need the specialized text.  This does mean that there are a
<span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of references, but that just goes to show how much
I am standing on the shoulders of others here.
</p><p>
(Various nice people have suggested various ways of combining the basic idea with VNC. After reading their explanations and studying the documentation, I have realized that I am too out of my depth here to give sensible advice. This would be the first project for the next caretaker of this document.)
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm84"></a>2.3. What You Should Be Aware Of</h3></div></div></div><p>
A mock mainframe setup is not for everybody. It is based on the following
assumptions:
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A small group of users.</strong></span> Though it should scale well from a family setup
to at least a classroom full of people (depending on the hardware and
programs used), this is not something you want to run a university or
Fortune-500-company with.  If you are alone, it doesn't make much sense
either. Go find somebody to move in with, then read on.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A sane system load.</strong></span> Unless you can really, really fork out a lot of money
for serious hardware (in which case, you should probably not be looking for
a <span class="emphasis"><em>mock</em></span> mainframe), this is not a setup where you should have your kids
playing <span class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> while you are encoding Ogg Vorbis files and your partner
is watching a DVD, all at the same time. It is designed primarily for
pedestrian workloads like email, browsing, chatting, and text processing.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Some downtime tolerance.</strong></span> We will be using standard, off-the-shelf,
home-user-grade hardware. These parts are not built for enterprise strength
work, and sooner or later, something is going to break or fail.  If
whatever you are doing urgently requires anything even close to 24/7
uptime, you'll have to go out and buy industrial strength hardware &#8212; and
remember to get somebody to guarantee that uptime in writing while you are
at it.
</p><p>
Some examples of when a mock mainframe might make sense:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
You have a family of email, surfing and chat freaks who all want to be
    online at the same time but don't use serious resources when they are.
</li><li class="listitem">
You have a small, closed teaching system that can't be expensive or take
    too much time to administer.
</li><li class="listitem">
You and your dorm buddies each have those high-powered
    computers to blow each other away with computer games, but don't want
    to go through the hassle of installing a serious Linux system on every
    one to do something as trivial as your actual course work.
</li><li class="listitem">
Your organization has absolutely no money and the only
    hardware you can get is stuff so old, it doesn't even have scrap value
    anymore, but you still have to give your people computer access.
</li></ul></div><p>
(If you have found other situations where this setup works, please let me
know.)

First, we will take a look at the individual parts of the setup &#8212; the mock
mainframe, the terminals, the support computers.  Then we'll discuss ways
of putting these elements together.  This is also where we will talk about
security. We'll also discuss life with more than one user and setups for
very weak hardware.
