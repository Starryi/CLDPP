The machines you use to connect to the mock mainframe should be
inexpensive, easy to maintain and, from a security point of view,
expendable.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm190"></a>4.1. Dual Boot Machines</h3></div></div></div><p>
Some people &#8212; those without a time consuming job, a spouse, or children,
for example &#8212; will want to be able to spend lots of time playing hardware
intensive computer games. Although more and more games are coming out for
Linux, this usually means running a machine that has a closed source
operating system such as Microsoft Windows. The solution to this problem is
to set up the game computers as <span class="emphasis"><em>dual boot machines</em></span>.  The messy details
are usually handled automatically by whatever distribution you are using;
if not, check out the <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation Strategies mini-HOWTO</em></span> Tobby
Banerjee.
</p><p>
The mock mainframe setup lets you keep the size and complexity of the Linux
partition on a dual boot machine to a minimum: All it has to do is to get X
running and connected. There are various way to do this, I usually just do
the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Go to <code class="literal">/etc/X11/xdm/</code>. In the file <code class="literal">Xservers</code>, comment out the line
  that is either <code class="literal">:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 vt07</code> or something similar
  by putting a hash mark ("#") at the beginning.  This will stop the
  computer from starting up X locally during boot time.
</li><li class="listitem">
In <code class="literal">etc/inittab</code>, insert a new line such as (for SuSE 8.2)
     <code class="literal">xx:5:respawn:/usr/X11R6/bin/X -query &lt;host&gt;</code> where "&lt;host&gt;" again is
     the name of the mock mainframe. The "5" is the runlevel that boots
     with X; "xx" is just a label I picked; you might have to adapt both to
     your system <span class="emphasis"><em>(please be careful:</em></span> Playing around with <code class="literal">inittab</code> can
     cause serious trouble). This will start X with a call to the mock
     mainframe, and you should get the login window when you are on the
     dual boot computer.
</li></ol></div><p>
Dual boot machines are nice if you don't have to switch between operating
systems too often. All of the rebooting can quickly become a bore, though,
and a dual boot machine cannot be considered truly expendable, given the
price of closed source operating systems.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm209"></a>4.2. Linux Terminals</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_top">Linux Terminal Server http://www.ltsp.org</a> (LTSP)
lets you use old hardware to put together bare-bones computers without hard
disks that run as thin clients.  These machines are cheap, quiet, quick to
set up, and once they are running, require just about zero maintenance
(unless, say, a fan breaks). The LTSP has taken all kinds of awards and is being used in situations far more demanding than a small mock mainframe for your home. For example, Orwell High School in England used LTSP machines and IBM Blade Servers for their complete system (see
http://www.cutterproject.co.uk/Casestudies/orwell_high_school_cutter_case_study.php ). If you are going to have terminals that are in use constantly, it is hard to see how this would not be the best solution.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Required hardware.</strong></span> More likely than not, somewhere in your cellar or
garage (or wherever you keep the stuff your partner lovingly calls "all
that crap"), you probably have a hopelessly outdated mainboard and
processor that you've been saving because you never know. Well, guess what.
</p><p>
If you are using a 100 Mbit ("Fast") Ethernet network, stay above a 486DX;
a Pentium II should be fine. See if you can scrape together about 32 MByte
of RAM. You'll need a floppy drive for the initial phase. You'll also need
a decent graphics card and a monitor &#8212; "decent" doesn't necessarily mean a
AGP graphics card with 128 MByte RAM, it means a clear, crisp picture.
</p><p>
The only thing you have to pay slightly more attention to is the network
card. Find one that has a socket to plug ROM chips in: a "bootable" network
card.  You can get away with one that doesn't have the socket, but then you
have to keep booting from the floppy. We'll also need the unique number
(<span class="emphasis"><em>Media Access Control</em></span> or MAC number) of the network card.  On good cards,
it is included on a little sticker on the board and looks something like
this:
</p><pre class="screen">
        00:50:56:81:00:01
</pre><p>
If you can't find it on the card, try booting the system with a Linux
rescue floppy or any other kernel.  The number should be displayed during
boot when the card is detected.
</p><p>
Add a keyboard and a case and that's it. Notice we don't have a hard disk,
let alone a CD-ROM. With the right kind of fans for the power supply and
the processor, you have a very quiet machine.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>How they work.</strong></span>
</p><p>
The LTSP home page has an in-depth technical discussion of what happens
when the system powers up. In brief, human terms:
</p><p>
When turned on, the Linux Terminal, like any other computer, looks around
to see what it has been given in way of hardware. It finds a network card
with a MAC and notices that it has a floppy with a boot disk (<span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> a boot
ROM in the network card.) It starts the boot program. This in effect tells
the Linux Terminal:
</p><pre class="literallayout">
       Got your MAC? Good. Now scream for help as loud as you can.
</pre><p>
The terminal's call goes through the whole (local) network. On the mock
mainframe, a program called <code class="literal">dhcpd</code> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Server Daemon</em></span>) is listening. It compares the MAC the terminal sent to a
list of machines it has been told to take care of, and then sends the
terminal an answer that includes an IP address and a location where the
terminal can get a kernel.  The terminal then configures itself with its
new name.
</p><p>
Using some more code from the boot program, the terminal starts a program
called <code class="literal">tftp</code> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Trivial File Transfer Protocol</em></span>, a stripped-down version of
the venerable <code class="literal">ftp</code>. This downloads the kernel from the host machine. The
terminal then boots this kernel.
</p><p>
Like every other Linux system, the terminal needs a root filesystem.
Instead of getting it from a harddisk, it imports it from the mock
mainframe via <code class="literal">NFS</code> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Network File System</em></span>). If the terminal has very
little memory, it can also mount a swap partition this way. The terminal
then starts X, connects to the mock mainframe via <code class="literal">xdm</code>, and throws up the
login screen.
</p><p>
This all happens amazingly fast. If you turn off all of the various BIOS
boot checks on the terminal and boot off of an EPROM in the network card
instead of a floppy, it happens even faster.
</p><p>
Running <code class="literal">dhcpd</code>, <code class="literal">tftpd</code>, and <code class="literal">nfsd</code> on the mock mainframe is a
security risk you might not be willing to take. In the chapter on Support
Machines, we'll show a way of getting around this.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Setting up the software.</strong></span> On the server (mock mainframe) side, you need to
install <code class="literal">nfsd</code> <code class="literal">tftpd</code>, and <code class="literal">dhcpd</code>, which your distribution should include
as standard packages.
</p><p>
Leave their configuration files untouched for now.  The LTSP configuration
and installation programs will do most of the work for you. Some files you should be aware of:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">/etc/dhcpd.conf</code>
</span></dt><dd>
       Provide the IP address of the terminal, the hostname, the IP address
       of the mock mainframe, the MAC of the terminal, and the default
       gateway. Check to see if the kernel pathname is correct.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/lts.conf</code>
</span></dt><dd>
       These options control the terminal itself.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">/etc/hosts</code>
</span></dt><dd>
       The names of the Linux Terminals and their IP addresses must be
       listed here. Further down, while describing the network, we'll
       introduce a systematic naming convention to make this easier.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">/etc/hosts.allow</code>
</span></dt><dd>
       Though not mentioned in the current LTSP documentation, you probably
       will have to add the following lines to this file:
       <code class="literal">rpc.mountd : &lt;terminal&gt; : ALLOW</code>
       <code class="literal">rpc.mountd : ALL : DENY</code>
       where "&lt;terminal&gt;" is the terminal's IP address. This tells the host
       to allow the terminal to mount the NFS file system.
</dd></dl></div><p>
Creating a boot floppy for the Linux Terminal is usually trivial. Armed
with your type of Ethernet card, go to the website mentioned in the LTSP
documentation (currently Marty Connor's
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.rom-o-matic.net/" target="_top">ROM-O-Matic Website http://www.rom-o-matic.net/</a>,
and follow the instructions for a boot
floppy. This should produce a file of a few dozen kilobytes that you can
then put on a floppy and boot from. Later, when you are sure that your
hardware configuration is not going to change and your setup works, replace
the floppy by an EPROM that you plug into your Ethernet card.
</p><p>
If you have a more modern motherboard on your Terminal machine, you might be able to get around all of this by selecting "PXE" (<span class="emphasis"><em>Pre-eXecution Environment</em></span>), "MBA" (<span class="emphasis"><em>Management Boot Agent</em></span>) or "Network" from the boot sequence (CMOS) menu.
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Using the terminals.</strong></span> Just how many Linux Terminals can one mock mainframe
support? The LTSP documentation gives the following example:
</p><pre class="literallayout">
    It's not unusual to have 40 workstations [Linux Terminals], all running
    Netscape and StarOffice from a Dual PIII-650 with 1GB of ram. We know
    this works. In fact, the load-average is rarely above 1.0!
</pre><p>
(This part of the documentation was written in March 2002, hence the
reference to Netscape, an ancestor of Mozilla FireFox. StarOffice is a
commercial variant of OpenOffice.org.)
</p><p>
Linux Terminals will probably require some user education.  People who have
only ever used Windows tend to have trouble visualizing a system where the
graphics layer is not only independent from the rest of the operating
system, but can also be accessed from multiple screens. The best way to
explain this is with examples. One trick that people new to X just love is
when programs start on one terminal and then appear on a different one. To
enable this (<span class="emphasis"><em>but only in a safe environment!</em></span>), sit
down at a terminal and type
</p><pre class="screen">
       xhost +&lt;host&gt;
</pre><p>
where "&lt;host&gt;" is the name of the mock mainframe. Then, move to a different
terminal and start a program such as <code class="literal">xeyes</code> or <code class="literal">xroach</code>:
</p><pre class="screen">
       xeyes -display &lt;terminal&gt;:0 &amp;
</pre><p>
The eyes should appear on the first terminal's monitor, providing endless
amusement for all. When you are done explaining what happened, remember to
retract the privileges again on the first terminal with
</p><pre class="screen">
       xhost -&lt;host&gt;
</pre><p>
You can also use this example to point out why it is dangerous to use the
<code class="literal">xhost</code> command.
</p><p>
Another question that usually comes up is the speed of Linux Terminals.
One nice way to demonstrate this is to run a series of screen savers from
the <code class="literal">xlock</code> suite. For example
</p><pre class="screen">
       xlock -inwindow -mode kumppa
</pre><p>
or more generally
</p><pre class="screen">
       xlock -inwindow -mode random
</pre><p>
Though the results will depend on your hardware, this usually takes care of
any doubts.
</p><p>
If you are using a desktop such as KDE that allows you to shut down the
computer when you log off, make sure that this function is disabled.
Otherwise, your users will shut down the mock mainframe when trying to get
out of the terminal. Tell them to <span class="emphasis"><em>just turn off the power</em></span> once they have
logged out. Older users will feel a sense of nostalgia, and younger users
will stare at you as if you have gone mad. Such is progress.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm300"></a>4.3. Real X Terminals</h3></div></div></div><p>
If fortune smiles on you or you are rich, you might find yourself with a
real thin client. Installing one is usually not much different than
setting up a Linux Terminal, except that you will need the software from
the vendor, you will probably have to pay for support, and when something
goes wrong, you won't be able to fix it yourself.
</p><p>
The Linux Documentation Project has a number of general and special HOWTOs
on how to set up X Terminals, for example the <span class="emphasis"><em>Connecting X Terminals to
Linux Mini-HOWTO</em></span> by Salvador J.  Peralta or the <span class="emphasis"><em>NCD-X-Terminal
Mini-HOWTO</em></span> by Ian Hodge.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm306"></a>4.4. X11 Forwarding with ssh</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you are on a machine that already supports X, you might be able to use the X11 Forwarding function of the Secure Shell (<code class="literal">ssh</code>) program. This is invoked with
</p><pre class="screen">
ssh -X &lt;HOST&gt;
</pre><p>
and creates a cryptographically protected tunnel to the host machine. X forwarding has to be configured on both machines &#8212; in <code class="literal">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> on the host machine, <code class="literal">X11Forwarding</code> must be set to <code class="literal">yes</code> &#8212; and it can be a little clumsy to use every day. However, for quick and dirty work, this is a good alternative.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm315"></a>4.5. X Server Programs</h3></div></div></div><p>
As a final way of connecting to the mock mainframe, there are "X server"
programs that run under different operating systems (remember, the X server
powers the terminal side of things). These let you log onto Linux machines
with an operating system that does not natively run X.
</p><p>
Most X servers for <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> cost money, in some cases a lot of money. The
single <a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/xfree/" target="_top">Cygwin http://cygwin.com/xfree/</a>, which
ports X (and GNU tools) to Windows machines.
</p><p>
If you have an <span class="strong"><strong>Apple</strong></span> computer with OS X, you are in better shape. For OS 10.3 "Panther", you need to install the X11 package from the installation disks. Then, with any text editor, create an executable bash shell script such as:
</p><pre class="screen">
#!/bin/bash
/usr/X11R6/bin/X -terminate -query "&lt;HOST&gt;" :1
exit
</pre><p>
Note the window number is :1, because :0 is used by Aqua. Do not use the X11 Server in
<code class="literal">/Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11</code>, as this doesn't understand the <code class="literal">-query</code> command: Apple doesn't seem to want people to run remote Aqua sessions. Then, tell the firewall what you are up to (you do have the firewall on, don't you): In <code class="literal">SystemPreferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Firewall</code> create an new entry "X
Window System" for Port 6001 (not: 6000). Then, move the shell script icon to wherever you want to keep it. To start an X session, click on the icon. An "EXEC"-icon called "X" will appear in the Dock. Click on this. Enjoy your connection. To get out again, press <code class="literal">Command-Option-a</code>. (Note: This has not been tested with Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger")
</p><p>
You can also check the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xdarwin.com/" target="_top">XDarwin http://www.xdarwin.com/</a> project. XDarwin is an Apple version of the X Window System that sits on the Darwin
operating system &#8212; a variant of BSD &#8212; that is the core of OS X.
</p><p>
(There is one GPL X Server written in <span class="strong"><strong>Java</strong></span> you might try:
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/" target="_top">Weirdx http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/</a>,
though the author points out it is not made for heavy loads.)
</p><p>
In this chapter, we have examined terminals that will give you a GUI
(<span class="emphasis"><em>graphical user interface</em></span>). If you are tough enough, you can also hook up
a text terminal to your mock mainframe and access the system via a CLI
(<span class="emphasis"><em>command line interface</em></span>). This option is covered further down.
