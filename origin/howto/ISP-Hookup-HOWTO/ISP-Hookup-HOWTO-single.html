<HR>
<EM>This document describes how to use Linux to connect to an
Internet Service Provider via a dial-up modem
TCP/IP
connection.
As well as the basic dial-up procedure and
IP
establishment, email and news handling is covered.</EM>
<HR>


<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This description has been made to answer a few questions about
how dial-up ISP (Internet Service Provider)
subscribers may configure and use Linux.</P>
<P>To aid those who will connect their Linux based machines to an
ISP for the first time, an attempt has been made to cover most
issues encountered.  This quite unavoidably will create a certain
degree of overlap with other Linux Howto-documents and
LDP books.  Reference should be made to these
documents to provide better understanding and detail.</P>
<P>Much of the existing documentation is targeted towards users with
a certain degree of experience, and first time users will often
have trouble sorting out the relevant information.</P>
<P>To simplify, the examples given will assume the following:</P>
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> User name: <CODE>dirk</CODE></LI>
<LI> Password: <CODE>PrettySecret</CODE></LI>
<LI> Internet service provider: <CODE>acme.xz</CODE></LI>
<LI> Email server: <CODE>mail.acme.xz</CODE></LI>
<LI> News server: <CODE>news.acme.xz</CODE></LI>
<LI> Name server: <CODE>193.212.1.0</CODE></LI>
<LI> Phone number: <CODE>12345678</CODE></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Our <CODE>dirk</CODE> will be calling his machine <CODE>roderick</CODE>.
<!--
roderick
-->
</P>
<P>All references in the table above should naturally be replaced by
whatever is valid for the ISP one is using.  Often, just a
minimum of changes will otherwise be required for users with
different ISPs.  I would like to be informed about what problems
you encounter on this account.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. How do I connect to the rest of the world?</A></H2>

<P>It will be assumed that we have installed the essential
networking software modules from your Linux distribution, and
that you have set up which serial port that is to be used for the
<!--
/dev/modem
-->
 /dev/modem.</P>
<P>The default configuration will usually only allow direct access
to /dev/modem as user <CODE>root</CODE>.</P>
<P>To connect to ISP shell accounts directly, and to experiment with
connection sequences, you may use the 
<!--
minicom
-->

minicom program.  It is pretty straight forward to
use.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The basic configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuration of the machine for use on the net should be done as
user <CODE>root</CODE>.  Before proceeding any further, ensure that
the file 
<!--
/etc/hosts.deny
-->

/etc/hosts.deny contains the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ALL: ALL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You would normally want to allow yourself, so add the following
line to 
<!--
/etc/hosts.allow
-->

/etc/hosts.allow:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ALL: LOCAL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Or if you insist:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ALL: 127.0.0.1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

For the following, note that it is meant for those connected via
PPP and with a dynamic IP address. If you
have the benefit of a fixed connection, there will be some
differences.</P>
<P>It is nice to have a name connected to the machine, a name that
the dynamic IP user really can select as he or she pleases.  Put
the name in 
<!--
/etc/HOSTNAME
-->

/etc/HOSTNAME:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
roderick
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The next step is to set up the name server in
<!--
/etc/resolv.conf
-->
 /etc/resolv.conf:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
search .
nameserver 193.212.1.0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
nameserver
-->

The name server must be specified by a numeric IP
address, and will be different from ISP to ISP. If required, you
can have up to three different servers, each on a separate line.
They will be requested in the sequence in which they are listed.</P>
<P>If you want to be able to use names like <CODE>somemachine</CODE> as
an abbreviation for <CODE>somemachine.acme.xz</CODE>, you must
replace the first line with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
search acme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
search
-->
</P>
<P>A certain minimum of configuration will also be required in
<!--
/etc/hosts
-->
 /etc/hosts.  Most users will
be able to manage with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
0.0.0.0         roderick
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
localhost
-->
 Those with a fixed IP-address will
obviously replace 0.0.0.0 with that.</P>
<P>Likewise, a minimum 
<!--
/etc/networks
-->

/etc/networks is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
loopback        127.0.0.0
localnet        0.0.0.0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
loopback
-->
 
<!--
localnet
-->
</P>
<P>You should also set your external mail domain in
<!--
/etc/mailname
-->
 /etc/mailname:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
acme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The username and password at the ISP must be specified in
<!--
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
-->

/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dirk * PrettySecret
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For those ISPs using CHAP instead of PAP
the filename is 
<!--
/etc/ppp/chap-secrets
-->

/etc/ppp/chap-secrets.</P>
<P>Finally, the nitty gritty regarding the connection procedure
itself must be specified before PPP can be initiated.  This is
done in 
<!--
/etc/ppp/chatscript
-->

/etc/ppp/chatscript:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
TIMEOUT 5
"" ATZ
OK ATDT12345678
ABORT "NO CARRIER"
ABORT BUSY
ABORT "NO DIALTONE"
ABORT WAITING
TIMEOUT 45
CONNECT ""
TIMEOUT 5
"name:" ppp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
OK
-->
 
<!--
ATDT
-->
 
<!--
ATZ
-->

<!--
TIMEOUT
-->
 
<!--
ABORT
-->
 
<!--
CONNECT
-->

Details here may have to be tuned somewhat.  The phone number in
the third line must of course be set as required.  Some users may
need to replace the <CODE>ATZ</CODE> modem initialization string with
something more tailored for the modem being used.  The last line
specifies that one is expecting a prompt that ends with
<CODE>name:</CODE>, and that the response should be
<CODE>ppp</CODE> when it arrives.  Other systems may have
other login procedures.</P>
<P>To actually initiate a call, the PPP protocol may be
initiated by issuing the following command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
exec pppd connect \
     'chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscript' \
      -detach crtscts modem defaultroute \
      user dirk \
      /dev/modem 38400
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
pppd
-->
 
<!--
chat
-->
 
<!--
connect
-->

<!--
/etc/ppp/chatscript
-->
 
<!--
detach
-->

<!--
crtscts
-->
 
<!--
modem
-->
 
<!--
defaultroute
-->

<!--
/dev/modem
-->
 We should now be on-air, and stay up
until the program is killed by typing a ctrl-C.  
<!--
ctrl-
C
-->
 Any messages concerning the connection will be appended
to the system logs. To read them, try:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tail /var/adm/messages
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
tail
-->
 
<!--
/var/adm/messages
-->
 or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dmesg
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
dmesg
-->
</P>
<P>As long as PPP is up, you will have direct access to the
Internet and may use programs like ftp,
ncftp, rlogin, telnet,
finger etc.  All these programs should be part of
the network package.</P>
<P>Further information concerning PPP is also available from:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="file:/usr/lib/ppp/README.linux">/usr/lib/ppp/README.linux</A></CODE></P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="file:/usr/lib/ppp/README.linux-chat">/usr/lib/ppp/README.linux-chat</A></CODE></P>
<P>Finally, an additional word about security The file
<!--
/etc/inetd.conf
-->
 /etc/inetd.conf lists
all services that your machine will offer externally. With the
<!--
/etc/hosts.deny
-->
 /etc/hosts.deny file we
have made, no external access will be allowed.  For those who
need it, access must be allowed explicitly in
<!--
/etc/hosts.allow
-->
 /etc/hosts.allow.
Local traffic may be allowed by:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ALL: LOCAL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

See also <CODE>man 5 hosts_access</CODE>.  
<!--
hosts_access
-->
</P>
<P>A final minor issue: A certain confusion exists regarding the
names of the POP protocols. A definition in
<!--
/etc/services
-->
 /etc/services compatible
with just about everything is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pop2            109/tcp         pop-2           # PostOffice V.2
pop3            110/tcp         pop-3 pop       # PostOffice V.3
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> Instead of 
<!--
chatscript
-->

chatscript, one might use the much more flexible
<!--

-->
 dip.  But not in connection with
<!--
diald
-->
 diald.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> Those fortunate enough to have a permanent
TCP/IP connection via e.g. an Ethernet may
safely ignore anything about PPP and rather start
concentrating about setting up their network card.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> Others may not have the possibility of using PPP,
but may be able to use SLIP instead, for which there
is support in much the same manner as for PPP. Another
possibility is UUCP Others again may have to rely on

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. How do I send and receive email</A></H2>

<P>First of all, ensure that 
<!--
sendmail
-->

sendmail is installed.  Sendmail sorts internal and
out-bound mail, and will buffer out-bound mail until such time it
is possible to forward it.</P>
<P>Sendmail is based on a configuration found in
<!--
/etc/sendmail.cf
-->
 /etc/sendmail.cf.  An
example suitable for ISP users can be found in:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/sendmail.cf">ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/sendmail.cf</A></CODE>
This is based on 
<!--
procmail
-->
 procmail as a
delivery agent but may easily be changed to use
<!--
deliver
-->
 deliver.</P>
<P>It is if course required to have an <B>official</B> domain
address for out-bound mail, something which is specified in
<!--
sendmail.cf
-->
 sendmail.cf:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# who I masquerade as (null for no masquerading)
DMacme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
DM
-->
 
<!--
masquerading
-->
 This assumes that you
have the same user name locally as you have at your ISP. If it is
different, just specify the full name instead:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DMdick@acme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Sendmail is now configured for sending <B>directly</B> to the
recipient.  To avoid long and repeated connections in those cases
where the connection to the receiving end is slow and irregular,
it is usually nice to use ones ISP as a buffer store.  This can
be specified by the DS specification:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# "Smart" relay host (may be null)
DSmail.acme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Beware that sendmail is somewhat sensitive to handling of tab
stop characters in 
<!--
sendmail.cf
-->

sendmail.cf.  You might want to use the
<!--
vi
-->
 vi editor to ensure that these tab
characters are retained unchanged.</P>
<P>Email reception can often be performed via the POP3
protocol, which can be initiated every time the connection is
brought up.  A script for testing this is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sendmail -q
popclient -3 -v mail.acme.xz -u dirk -p "PrettySecret" \
       -k -o /usr/spool/mail/dirk
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
popclient
-->
 This script may be started after PPP
connection has been established.  Beware that this script is just
for testing, so ensure that the local mailbox is left untouched
while it runs.  The <CODE>-k</CODE> option means that the mail is
<B>kept</B> in the ISP mailbox, and you are simply given a copy
of the mail.  You would of course want to remove this option once
you are confident that your setup is working.</P>
<P>Beware that the password will show on the command line.  Also
note that popclient is getting old fashioned, and that you should
consider using 
<!--
fetchmail
-->
 fetchmail
instead.</P>
<P>A more secure and better version of this script may be found at:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/pop-script.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/pop-script.tar.gz</A></CODE></P>
<P>This version of the script requires that 
<!--
procmail
-->

procmail is installed, but that is something you'll
never regret anyway. Most distributions include it, otherwise you
may try:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Mail/mailhandlers/procmail-3.10-2.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Mail/mailhandlers/procmail-3.10-2.tar.gz</A></CODE></P>
<P>Procmail is a simple and flexible tool that can sort incoming
email based on a large range of criteria. In addition to being
able to handle automated tasks like vacation messages
and such.</P>
<P>Note that when we use procmail directly as in this case, the
situation is somewhat different from what is described in the
procmail documentation.  A .forward is <B>not</B>
required, and we also don't need a .procmailrc.  The
latter is only required if we want to sort the mail.</P>
<P>The user interface for reading and sending of email can be found
in programs like 
<!--
pine
-->
 pine or
<!--
elm
-->
 elm.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> Fetchmail has recently become an
improved alternative to popclient.  The latest version is
available from:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ccil.org/pub/esr/fetchmail/fetchmail-3.3.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.ccil.org/pub/esr/fetchmail/fetchmail-3.3.tar.gz</A></CODE></P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> For an ordinary dial-up ISP user it is not really
necessary to have the sendmail daemon
active.  To reduce resource usage, and possibly other problems,
one may thus comment out any startup of sendmail, as is usually
found in /etc/rc.d/rc.M (this varies from
distribution to distribution).</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> In place of sendmail one might use the simpler
<!--
smail
-->
 smail.  You'll find a good
description of it (as well as most other things mentioned here)
in the <I>Linux Network Administrator's Guide</I>.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> There is also an m4 macro package for
making a fresh 
<!--
/etc/sendmail.cf
-->

/etc/sendmail.cf.  For a simple installation it
might be just as well to modify an existing configuration.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> There are also simpler although less flexible
alternatives for handling email.  Pine may run
stand-alone as long as it is configured properly, for instance.
It might even be possible to use newer versions of some
web-browsers.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> Many are very enthusiastic regarding the Emacs
companion Gnus as an email and news handler. Further
information can be found at:</P>

<P>
<!--

 To be able to read news while
offline and thus reduce phone bills and give greater
flexibility, one must set up a local news-spool of one
sort or the other.  This requires some configuration, and there
will also be a certain amount of disk space involved.  After
initial setup, things should run more or less by themselves, with
only some attention needed from time to time.</P>
<P>Two different solutions will be described here.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 How do I set up C News?</A>
</H2>

<P>The solution described here is based on the news-server
<B>C News</B> and the NNTP protocol.
C News was originally targeted towards another sort of
configuration, but is flexible enough to handle our situation
too.  One might also use the more recent <B>INN</B>
news server but it might require a bit more in terms
of resources. Either way, be careful <B>not</B> to install
both; they don't live together easily.</P>
<P>It is crucial that all maintenance of news is done while logged
in as user <CODE>news</CODE>, and that all configuration
files is placed in 
<!--
/usr/lib/news
-->

/usr/lib/news.  One way of handling this is, while
logged in as <CODE>root</CODE> to write <CODE>su news;
cd</CODE>.</P>
<P>The most important files in the configuration are:</P>
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> 
<!--
active
-->
 active is an overview
over active newsgroups.  It is updated as required by the command
<!--
addgroup
-->
 addgroup, e.g.  <CODE>addgroup
comp.os.linux.networking y</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> 
<!--
organization
-->
 organization should
simply contain whatever you want in the <I>Organization:</I>
header field, in our case:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> 
<!--
mailname
-->
 mailname should in our
case be set to <CODE>acme.xz</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> 
<!--
whoami
-->
 whoami is set to the name
of your <CODE>site</CODE> in the Path: thread.
In a setup as described here, using 
<!--
newsx
-->

newsx, this name will never leave the machine, so
you can set this to whatever you like as long as you are pretty
sure it is unique. In this case <CODE>roderick</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> The file 
<!--
sys
-->
 sys controls
fetching and further distribution of news.  We will assume the
ISP in our case adds <CODE>acme.xz</CODE> to the Path, and that this
is the only news source we have.  The example given really tells
that we will accept everything that arrives, and that we will
only post news to <CODE>acme.xz</CODE> that it hasn't seen before,
and is originally posted at our own site.  In this simplified
setup we assume that the all groups will come from a single
source.  <CODE>/all</CODE> specifies the distribution, and
<B>must</B> be included.  The letter <CODE>F</CODE> says
that (pointers to) outgoing news articles will be collected in a
file.</LI>

</UL>
</P>
<P>C News needs a certain degree of daily maintenance, but this can
be specified once and for all via the command <CODE>crontab -e</CODE>
<!--
crontab
-->
 issued as user <CODE>news</CODE>.  A suggested
setup follows; it can be tuned as required:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# maintain incoming and outgoing batches
10,40 *  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun

# expire C News, once a day
30 0  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/expire/doexpire

# monitor and report if needed
00 2  * * sat /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/addmissing
40 3  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/newswatch
50 3  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/newsdaily
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
newsrun
-->
 newsrun moves articles in and
out (twice every hour), 
<!--
doexpire
-->

doexpire will delete articles as they get old (every
night at 00:30), and the three last commands does various
supervisory and error correcting tasks.</P>
<P>One should also ensure that things are cleaned up when starting
the machine. As user root, add the following line to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
su news -c /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/newsboot
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

News may be collected via the program <B>NewsX</B>,
<!--
NewsX
-->
 picking news from an NNTP-server
The program can be found at:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/transport/newsx-0.9.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/transport/newsx-0.9.tar.gz</A></CODE>

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/newsx-0.9.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/newsx-0.9.tar.gz</A></CODE></P>
<P>Setting up <CODE>NewsX</CODE> is quite simple.
Installation is a classic case of:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make
su
make install
exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>With the setup outlined here, all you have to do is to create the
groups you want to read using the 
<!--
addgroup
-->

addgroup command.</P>
<P>To fetch articles, user <CODE>news</CODE> issues the
following commands (assuming communication via PPP or similar is
up):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
newsrun
newsx acme news.acme.xz
newsrun
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
newsrun
-->
</P>
<P>The option <CODE>-d</CODE> gives continuous printout to the screen.
Refer to the NewsX documentation for further information.</P>
<P>NewsX will also take care of posting of outgoing news.</P>
<P>To control disposal of articles as they get old, a file
<CODE>explist</CODE> is required.  The comments in this
example should explain what we want to do:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# hold onto history lines 14 days, nobody gets &gt;120 days
/expired/                       x       14      -
/bounds/                        x       0-1-120 -

# retain these for 2 months
comp.sources,comp.os.linux.all  x       60      -

# noise gets thrown away fast
junk,control                    x       2       -

# default:  14 days, no archive
all                             x       14      -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> In a small news-spool, one will usually not need
the newsgroup <CODE>control</CODE>.  The traffic is <B>huge</B>
compared to the possible usefulness. The main point is that
articles will be canceled, and that groups may be created
automatically. To ensure that control messages containing
<CODE>newgroup</CODE> not shall mess up things for us, a file called
<!--
newgroupperm
-->
 newgroupperm specifies
what we will allow:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
comp.os.linux   tale@uunet.com  yv
all             any             nq
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In this example, all proper groups under comp.os.linux will be
created (y), and the user <CODE>news</CODE> will be notified (v).
Everything else will be silently (q) ignored (n).  The last line
is sufficient if you want to create all groups manually.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> An alternative to NewsX is suck.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 How do I set up Leafnode?</A>
</H2>

<P>A different solution altogether is to install the integrated
package

to configure.  It is available via:</P>
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.troll.no/freebies/leafnode.html">http://www.troll.no/freebies/leafnode.html</A></CODE></P>
<P>As for C News, all news maintenance really should be performed as
user <CODE>news</CODE>.</P>
<P>The home directory for leafnode is in
/usr/lib/leafnode.  To install, write:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/lib/leafnode
tar -xzvf leafnode-0.8.tgz
cd leafnode-0.8
make
su
make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note in the following that the prefix
/usr/local/sbin should be replaced with

defines the NNTP server. In our case:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="s6">6. How do I automate the connection procedure?</A></H2>

<P>Automated handling of news and email is quite easy to implement
in Linux.</P>
<P>First and foremost one should make a
<!--
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on
-->
 /usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on
that initiates the ISP connection.  Often, this file will simply
contain the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/pppd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
pppd
-->
 Further specification will be performed in
<!--
/etc/ppp/options

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
connect "/usr/lib/ppp/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscript"
crtscts

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To end a connection, use the supplied version of
<!--
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off
-->

/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off.</P>
<P>Having tested the functionality of these two scripts, one must
then write scripts that perform the various tasks. The script to
collect email has been described before, and we will here assume
it is located at /home/dirk/pop.</P>
<P>A script for exchange of email can then be produced in
/root/mail:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
# exchange mail
# 10 minutes timeout:
TIMEOUT=600
DT=10

# kick sendmail:
sendmail -q &amp;

# retrieve mail:
su dirk -c /home/dirk/pop

# wait for sendmail to terminate:
t=0
while ! mailq | grep -q "Mail queue is empty"; do
    t=$[$t+$DT]
    if [ $t -gt $TIMEOUT ] ; then
     echo "sendmail -q timeout ($TIMEOUT).."
     exit 1
    fi
    sleep $DT
done

exit 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The script to exchange news may be placed in
/usr/lib/news/news:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# exchange news
# must be run as news:
cd /usr/lib/news

#update the outgoing batch (C News):
/usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun &lt; /dev/null

#exchange news:
/usr/lib/newsbin/newsx acme news.acme.xz

#and flush the incoming batch:
/usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun &lt; /dev/null
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

A script to connect the various bits and pieces remains, and can
be placed in /root/news+mail:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# exchange news and email
# must be run as root
#
if ! /usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on; then
    exit 1

trap "/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off" 1 2 3 15

#exchange news+mail:
/root/mail &amp;
su news -c ~news/news
wait

#disconnect..
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off

#update the incoming batch (C News):
su news -c /usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun &lt; /dev/null &amp;

exit 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>It is quite easy to make an extension to the above that only will
establish a connection if outgoing email and news is present.
Lets call it 
<!--
/root/news+mail.cond
-->

/root/news+mail.cond, and keep in mind that the name
of the outgoing news-spool must be updated to suit:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# exchange news and email, only if outgoing news or mail
# (C News spool)
if [ -s /var/spool/news/out.going/acme/togo ] ||
    ! ( mailq | grep -q "Mail queue is empty"); then
     /root/news+mail
fi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The only thing remaining is to specify when all this is going to
happen.  This is done using the command <CODE>crontab -e</CODE>
<!--
crontab
-->
 as root.  Let us assume that we always want
to exchange news and mail at 07:00 in the morning, and after that
every 4th hour assuming there are outgoing email and news:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
00 7            * * *   /root/news+mail
00 11,15,19,23  * * *   /root/news+mail.cond
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Ensure that every component is tested well before you connect
them together. One may later add several other tasks, such as
adjustment of the time of day (using 
<!--
ntpdate
-->

ntpdate), and automatic update (mirroring) of
locally maintained WWW and FTP files up to the ISP (using make
and ftp).</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> Depending on ones preferences, it is also possible
to turn the process upside down. Every time a PPP link is
initiated, the script 
<!--
/etc/ppp/ip-up
-->

/etc/ppp/ip-up will be started.  One may here add
whatever magic is required to start exchange of email and news.
See <CODE>man pppd</CODE> for further detail.</P>
<P><B>ALT:</B> It is also possible to automatically connect PPP
whenever network traffic is detected.  This is in many ways the
more elegant solution, but it is quite dependent on a good
configuration to avoid frequent (and costly) connections being
made.  More information can be found at:</P>
