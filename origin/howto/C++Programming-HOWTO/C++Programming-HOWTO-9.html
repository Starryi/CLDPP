<P>In C, you use malloc(), free() and variants of malloc() to allocate and free
memory, but these functions have their pitfalls. Therefore C++ introduced
operators for handling memory, these operators are called <B>new</B> and
<B>delete</B>. These operators allocates and frees memory from the heap (or
sometimes called the free store) at runtime.</P>
<P>In C++, you should always use <B>new</B> and <B>delete</B> unless
you're really forced to use malloc() and free(). But be aware that you
cannot mix the two. You cannot malloc() memory, and then delete it
afterwards, likewise you can't "new" memory, and then free it with free().</P>


<H2><A NAME="zap"></A> <A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO.html#toc9.1">C++ Zap (Delete) function </A>
</H2>

<P>The <B>delete</B> and <B>new</B> operators in C++ are much better than
the malloc and free functions of C.  Consider using new and zap (delete
function) instead of malloc and free as much as possible.</P>
<P>To make 
<B>delete</B> 
operators even more cleaner, make a Zap() inline function. Define 
a zap() function like this: 
<HR>
<PRE>
// Put an assert to check if x is NULL, this is to catch
// program "logic" errors early. Even though delete works 
// fine with NULL by using assert you are actually catching 
// "bad code" very early

// Defining Zap using templates
// Use zap instead of delete as this will be very clean
template &lt;class T>
inline void zap(T &amp; x)
{
        {assert(x != NULL);}
        delete x;
        x = NULL;
}

// In C++ the reason there are 2 forms of the delete operator is - because
// there is no way for C++ to tell the difference between a pointer to
// an object and a pointer to an array of objects. The delete operator
// relies on the programmer using "[]" to tell the two apart.
// Hence, we need to define zaparr function below.
// To delete array of pointers
template &lt;class T>
inline void zaparr(T &amp; x)
{
         {assert(x != NULL);}
     delete [] x;
     x = NULL;
}
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The zap() function will delete the pointer and set it NULL.
This will ensure that even if multiple zap()'s are called on the
same deleted pointer then the
program will not crash. Please see the function zap_example() in 
<A HREF="http://www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com">example_String.cpp</A>
click on 'Source code of C++'.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        // See zap_example() in example_String.cpp
        zap(pFirstname);
        //zap(pFirstname); // no core dumps.  Because pFirstname is NULL now
        //zap(pFirstname); // no core dumps.  Because pFirstname is NULL now

        zap(pLastname);
        zap(pJobDescription);

        int *iiarray = new int[10];
        zaparr(iiarray);
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>There is nothing magical about this, it just saves 
repetetive code, saves typing time and makes programs more readable. The
C++ programmers often forget to reset the deleted pointer
to NULL, and this causes annoying
problems causing core dumps and crashes. The zap() takes care of 
this automatically.
Do not stick a typecast in the zap() function -- if something errors out on the 
above zap() function it likely has another error somewhere.</P>
<P>Also 
<A HREF="#my_malloc">my_malloc()</A>
, my_realloc() and my_free() should be used 
instead of malloc(), realloc() and free(), as they
are much cleaner and have additional checks. 
For an example, see the file "String.h" which is using 
the 
<A HREF="#my_malloc">my_malloc()</A>
and my_free() functions.</P>
<P><B>WARNING :</B> Do not use free() to free memory allocated with 'new'
or 'delete' to free memory allocated with malloc. If you do, then
results will be unpredictable.</P>

<H2><A NAME="my_malloc"></A> <A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO.html#toc9.2">Usage of my_malloc and my_free </A>
</H2>

<P>Try to avoid using malloc and realloc as much as possible and use <B>new</B>
and <B>
<A HREF="#zap">zap</A>(delete)</B>. But sometimes you may need to 
use the C style memory allocations in C++. Use the functions 
<B>my_malloc()</B> ,
<B>my_realloc()</B> and
<B>my_free()</B>. 
These functions do proper allocations and initialisations and try to prevent 
memory problems. Also these functions (in DEBUG mode) can keep track 
of memory allocated and print total memory usage before and after the program
is run. This tells you if there are any memory leaks.</P>
<P>The my_malloc and my_realloc is defined as below. It allocates little more memory
(SAFE_MEM = 5) and initializes the space and if it cannot allocate it exits the
program. The 'call_check(), remove_ptr()' functions are active only 
when DEBUG_MEM is defined in 
makefile and are assigned to 
((void)0) i.e. NULL
for non-debug production release. They enable the total-memory used tracing.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
void *local_my_malloc(size_t size, char fname[], int lineno) 
{
        size_t  tmpii = size + SAFE_MEM;
        void *aa = NULL;
        aa = (void *) malloc(tmpii);
        if (aa == NULL)
                raise_error_exit(MALLOC, VOID_TYPE, fname, lineno);

<HR>

See 
<A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO-23.html#Appendix A">my_malloc.cpp</A>.
and the header file
<A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO-23.html#Appendix A">my_malloc.h</A>.
for full implementation of the my_malloc program.</P>
<P>An example on usage of my_malloc and my_free as below:
<HR>
<PRE>
        char    *aa;
        int     *bb;
        float   *cc;
        aa = (char *) my_malloc(sizeof(char)* 214);
        bb = (int *) my_malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
        cc = (float *) my_malloc(sizeof(int) * 20);

        aa = my_realloc(aa, sizeof(char) * 34);
        bb = my_realloc(bb, sizeof(int) * 14);
        cc = my_realloc(cc, sizeof(float) * 10);
</PRE>
<HR>

Note that in my_realloc you do not need to cast the datatype as the
variable itself is passed and correct my_realloc is called which
returns the proper datatype pointer. The my_realloc has overloaded
functions for char*, int* and float*.</P>



<H2><A NAME="garbage"></A> <A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO.html#toc9.3">Garbage Collector for C++ </A>
</H2>

<P>In C/C++ Garbage Collection is not a standard feature and hence allocating 
and freeing storage explicitly is difficult, complicated and is error-prone.
The <B>Garbage Collection (GC)</B> is not part of the C++ standard because there 
are just so many ways how one could implement it; there are many 
GC techniques, and deciding to use a particular one would not
be good for certain programs. Computer scientists had designed many GC 
algorithms, each one of them catering to a particular problem domain.
There is no one single generic GC which will tackle all the problem domains.
As a consequence, GC is not part of C++ standard, they just left it out.
Still, you always have the choice of many freely available C++ libraries that do 
the job for you.</P>

<H2><A NAME="anticrash"></A> <A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO.html#toc9.4">Anti-crash With const </A>
</H2>

<P>You must use <B>const</B> at every opportunity.
The <B>const</B> is your most powerful anti-crash weapon. An additional benefit 
is that it makes your code self-documenting. For instance, look at this:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
const char *add2strings(const char *sz1, const char *sz2);
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Such a declaration guarantee's that no matter what wierd things go on 
within the function, it can't harm the application programmer's two 
strings sz1 and sz2. If any memory corruption occurs, it will be to 
variables within the function's scope. This, of course, greatly 
reduces side effect bugs.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the declaration of the return pointer as 
<B>const</B>
means that 
the application programmer can't "reach inside" the function to 
corrupt its scope. For instance, if the return value is a static array 
of 40 characters, if the return wasn't static the application programmer could do this:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
char *pchName = add2strings("James", "Bond 007");
strcat(pchName, " jumps out of the plane and parachutes down");
cout &lt;&lt; "I just corrupted an internal variable of add2strings. ";
cout &lt;&lt; "Will I see this message?\n";
cout &lt;&lt; "Will it crash later in the program? Who knows!\n";
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Fortunately, because add2strings() returns a 
<B>const</B>
pointer, you'll get a compiler error on this:</P>
<P>char *pchName = add2strings("Big galaxies", "Big stars");</P>
<P>Even if you declared pchName as a 
<B>const</B>
char *, the moment you modified 
its contents with strcat() you'd get a compile error. The 
<B>const</B>
keyword 
helps the programmer keep any errors localized, thus greatly reducing 
the likelihood of side-effect errors.</P>




<H2><A NAME="forgetc"></A> <A NAME="ss9.5">9.5</A> <A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO.html#toc9.5">Forget C </A>
</H2>

<P>Forget you ever knew printf(). Use cout &lt;&lt;. Of course, scanf() was 
flirting with disaster even in the rough and ready C days. Use cin >>, or make 
your own input routines or classes. What about that wonderful 
sprintf()? Instead of this:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
/* . . . */
char myaString[100];
sprintf(myaString, "%s, %s %c", myaLname, myaFname, *myaMname);
cout &lt;&lt; myaString &lt;&lt; '\n';
</PRE>
<HR>

Try This:
<HR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h>
#include &lt;strstream.h>
/* . . . */
ostrstream ost;
ost &lt;&lt; myaLname &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; myaFname &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; *myaMname;
ost.put(0); //null terminate the string cout
cout &lt;&lt; ost.str() &lt;&lt; '\n';
</PRE>
