<P>The students in Universities can debate the pros and cons of C++ and Java.
Just for a debate sake, given below are some points discussing C++ versus Java:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Generic Programming:</B> C++ has an extremely powerful template meta
language, that allows a programmer to reuse many algorithms without paying
neither performance, nor conveniences like type safety, for it.  The
somewhat equivalent for java, which is "all classes inherit from Object",
so that you can have vectors, lists, cloneable, etc., is at the same time
cumbersome and dangerous, beacuse it forces programmers to duplicate code
possibly introducing nasty minor bugs -the ones that results in intermitent
failures, the worsts of all- doing that re-implementations. 
Conclusions are that :
<UL>
<LI> The issue is being addressed right now (next version of Java spec will have
some genericity), justifying C++ for having it in since quite a while, 
and </LI>
<LI> Language designers wanted to avoid compiler complications due to meta
programming, praising C++ for being brave.  When would we see
things like "expression templates" in Java ? Perhaps never...</LI>
</UL>



</LI>
<LI> <B>Multiple Inheritance: </B>Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance:  
While it allows a class to
implement as many interfaces as it wants, a new class can not make use of
"arquetipical" implementations of the interfaces.  What happens all
the time, is that the programmer simply produces such implementation of the
interface, and then copies and pastes that into each new class that
implements it.  The problem with that is the same as above:  minor bugs
leading to intermitent crashes, and also the problem that once you decide
to change the interface.... you have to browse in all your code for each
implementation to adapt it to the change.... that is the most anti Object Oriented
practice you could find.  Instead, in C++ you simply inherit some virtual
methods from the "interface class", and just re-implement the really
important pure virtual methods of the base class (the real interface). In
that way, you can provide directly in the base class some services
(methods) for implementers of its pure virtual ones.  Some computer
intellectuals say that multiple inheritance is an error.  
It is a very important tool for
describing the reality to the computer (design).


</LI>
<LI> <B>Operator overloading:</B> Suppose you are developing some numerical
recipes, and you work with matrices, where you have to transpose, invert,
add, multiply by scalar, etc.  So, honestly, what do you prefer?:  (A, B,
C, D matrices and scale a double):
<HR>
<PRE>
        A = scale * B^-1 *  (C + D)  * ~B   
        (in C++ overloading * twice, +, ^, and ~ operators)
        to this Java equivalent :
        A.assign(B.invert().scalar_product(scale).product(C.add(D)).product(B.transpose())
</PRE>
<HR>


By the way, these are real life examples.


</LI>
<LI> This differentiates C++ from Java:   C++ is a very rich language, and
yet, easily extensible (but not mutable, as Stroustrup says), but in the
other hand, Java is a very poor language (altough it is very useful), and not 
extensible at all.  If you need something outside what
normal Java can provide, you have no alternative - use JNI. Consequently,
many many important programming techniques or design patterns can be
naturally expressed in C++ only.


</LI>
<LI> Some more points .... to come in future..</LI>
