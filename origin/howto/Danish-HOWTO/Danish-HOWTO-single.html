This document describes how to configure Linux and various Linux
applications for Danish locale standards such as keyboard, font, paper-size etc. It is hoped that Linux users from other places in
Western Europe will find this document useful too.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction </A><!--Danish!introduction--></H2>

<P>All European users of almost any operating system have two problems:
The first is to tell the computer that you have a non-American keyboard,
and the second is to get the computer to display the special
characters. To make matters worse some applications will also consider you
an exception if you are not an American and require special options or the
setting of environment variables.</P>
<P>Under Linux you change the way your computer interprets the
keyboard with the commands <CODE>loadkeys</CODE> and <CODE>xmodmap</CODE>. <CODE>loadkeys</CODE>
will modify the keyboard for plain Linux while <CODE>xmodmap</CODE> makes the
modifications necessary when the handshaking between X11 and Linux is
imperfect.</P>
<P>To display the characters you need to tell your applications that you
use the ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. Latin-1) international set of glyphs. This is
not always necessary, but a number of key applications need special
attention.</P>
<P>This HOWTO is intended to tell Danish users how to do this. If
you continue to have problems after reading this you can try the
German HOWTO, the Linux Keyboard and Console HOWTO or the ISO 8859-1 National
Character Set FAQ. Many of the hints contained herein are cribbed from
there. See section 
<A HREF="#docs">Other documents of relevance</A> for
pointers to these documents. You should also send me a mail describing your
problems.</P>
<P>A final problem is that error-messages, menus and documentation of the
applications are mostly in English. There is a GNU project under way to
address this problem. You can see what it is all about by downloading
the file <CODE>ABOUT-NLS</CODE> or the package <CODE>gettext-0.10.tar.gz</CODE> (or any
later version) from your favourite mirror of the GNU archive. This
project needs volunteers for the translations. Send a mail to
<CODE>da-request@li.org</CODE> with the body ``subscribe'' if you want to contribute
to the Danish part of the project. The documentation in the <CODE>gettext</CODE>
package describes how to use such translations in your own programs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Keyboard setup </A><!--Danish!keyboard configuration--></H2>

<H2><A NAME="loadkbd"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Loading a keytable</A>
<!--Danish!keytable, loading--></H2>

<P>You have two tools for configuring your keyboard. Under plain
Linux you have <CODE>loadkeys</CODE> and under X11 you have <CODE>xmodmap</CODE>.</P>
<P>To try out <CODE>loadkeys</CODE> type one of these two commands:
<PRE>
loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/dk.map 
</PRE>

or
<PRE>
loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/dk-latin1.map
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The difference between the two keymaps is that <CODE>dk-latin1.map</CODE>
enables `dead' keys while <CODE>dk.map</CODE> does not. Dead keys are explained
in section 
<A HREF="#deadkeys">Dead keys and accented characters</A>. The
program <CODE>loadkeys</CODE> and the keymaps are part of the package 
<CODE>kbd-0.??.tar.gz</CODE> which (with differing version numbers ??) is available
with all Linux distributions.</P>
<P>Usually <CODE>loadkeys</CODE> is executed at boot-time from one of the scripts
under the directory <CODE>/etc/rc.d/</CODE>. Details vary between distributions.</P>
<P>(Note for non-Danish readers: Support for other languages is enabled
in a similar manner. Use <CODE>es.map</CODE> for Spanish keyboards etc.)</P>
<P>Versions of XFree86 up to and including v3.1.2 will normally follow the
keymap used by plain Linux, but you can modify keyboard behavior under X11
with <CODE>xmodmap</CODE>. Usually the X11 initialization process will run this
command automatically if you have a file called <CODE>.Xmodmap</CODE> in your
home directory.</P>
<P>In XFree86 v3.2 and higher you should have the following <CODE>Keyboard</CODE>
section in your <CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE> (or <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config</CODE>) file
(it should be made automatically by the program <CODE>XF86Setup</CODE> if you choose
a Danish keytable):

   XkbVariant      "nodeadkeys"
EndSection
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The only keyboard variant available at the moment is <CODE>"nodeadkeys"</CODE>, but
dead keys can still be made to work. See section 
<A HREF="#deadkeys">Dead keys and accented characters</A> for more information on this. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Getting the AltGr key to work under X11 </A>
<!--Danish!AltGr key--><!--Danish!X!AltGr key--></H2>

<P>For versions of XFree86 up to and including v3.1.2 you should edit the file
<CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE> (or <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config</CODE>) and make sure the
line
<PRE>
RightAlt    ModeShift
</PRE>

appears in the <CODE>Keyboard</CODE> section. Usually you can do this by
uncommenting the appropriate line. In XFree86 v3.1.2 you can use
<CODE>AltGr</CODE> as an alias for <CODE>RightAlt</CODE>.</P>
<P>The <CODE>AltGr</CODE> key should work as expected in XFree86 v3.2 and higher if you
choose Danish keyboard support. </P>

<H3>Making {, [, ] and } work under Metro-X <!--Danish!X!Metro-X--></H3>

<P>You can't input the characters ``{'' <CODE>(&lt;AltGr&gt;&lt;7&gt;)</CODE>,

<CODE>(&lt;AltGr&gt;&lt;9&gt;)</CODE> and ``}'' <CODE>(&lt;AltGr&gt;&lt;0&gt;)</CODE>
under the Metro-X server. This bug has been observed under versions 3.1.5
and 3.1.8 of the server.</P>
<P>To correct this bug you have to edit the file
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/dk</CODE> and change the lines
<PRE>
key &lt;AE07> {    [               7,           slash      ]       };

<H2><A NAME="deadkeys"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Dead keys and accented characters</A>
<!--Danish!dead keys--></H2>

<P>Dead keys are those that do not type anything until you hit another
key. Tildes and umlauts are like this by default under plain Linux if
you use the <CODE>dk-latin1.map</CODE> keymap. This is the default
behaviour for these keys under Microsoft Windows as well.</P>

Under plain Linux type
<PRE>
loadkeys dk.map
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>Removing dead key functionality under XFree86 v3.2 and higher

Put the following line in the <CODE>Keyboard</CODE> section of your
<CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE> (or <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config</CODE>) file:
<PRE>
XkbVariant      "nodeadkeys"
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Invoking dead key functionality <!--Danish!dead keys!invoking--></H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Invoking dead key functionality under plain Linux

Under plain Linux type
<PRE>
loadkeys dk-latin1.map
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>Invoking dead key functionality under X11R6 sessions

First you must make sure you are running XFree86 v3.1.2 or
higher. Download and install everything related to the newest release if 
you have a lower version number. Neither compose nor dead keys will work in
X11R6 applications unless these are compiled with support for accented
(8-bit) character input. An example of such an application is
<CODE>GNU emacs</CODE> version 19.30 (or higher.)

Some X11 applications still do not support this input method. Eventually
this situation might improve, but until that happens you can either hack your
applications or submit polite bug reports to the  program authors. The latter
approach is often the most efficient. See section 
<A HREF="#programming">Programming tips for X11</A> for some advice on what needs to be done.

Next you will have to map a key to <CODE>Multi_key</CODE> (<CODE>Compose</CODE>.) The
<CODE>Scroll Lock</CODE> key is most likely already mapped as such if you use
XFree86 v3.1.2 (you can verify this with the program <CODE>xev</CODE>,) and it is
easy to map the right <CODE>Control</CODE> key by uncommenting the appropriate line
in the <CODE>Keyboard</CODE> section of the XFree86 configuration file (often
<CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE> or <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config</CODE>.) If you wish to use
some other key, or if you are using XFree86 v3.2 or higher and want to change
the default, you should put something like
<PRE>
keycode 78 = Multi_key
</PRE>

in your <CODE>~/.Xmodmap</CODE> file. The statement in the example defines
<CODE>Scroll Lock</CODE> as the <CODE>Compose</CODE> key. The default <CODE>Compose</CODE> key in
XFree86 v3.2 and higher is <CODE>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;AltGr&gt;</CODE>.

XFree86 v3.2 and higher comes without support for the dead keys on the standard
Danish keyboard. To get this support you have to change a few lines in the
<CODE>xkb_symbols "basic"</CODE> section of the file
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/dk</CODE>. The lines  
<PRE>
key &lt;AE12> {    [           acute,           grave      ],   
                [             bar,     dead_ogonek      ]       };
key &lt;AD12> {    [       diaeresis,     asciicircum      ],   
                [      asciitilde,     dead_macron      ]       };
</PRE>

should be changed to
<PRE>
key &lt;AE12> {    [      dead_acute,      dead_grave      ],   
                [             bar,     dead_ogonek      ]       };
key &lt;AD12> {    [  dead_diaeresis, dead_circumflex      ],   
                [      dead_tilde,     dead_macron      ]       };
</PRE>


After these changes you can get support for dead keys by removing the line
<PRE>
XkbVariant      "nodeadkeys"
</PRE>

from the <CODE>Keyboard</CODE> section of your <CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE> (or
<CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config</CODE>) file.

(Note for non-Danish readers: There are files for many local keyboard maps in
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols</CODE>.) 

The available keystroke combinations are listed in
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose</CODE>. There are some
bugs in that file you will want to fix:
<UL>
<LI>The line reading
<PRE>
&lt;dead_tilde> &lt;space>                    : "~"   tilde
</PRE>

should be changed to 
<PRE>
&lt;dead_tilde> &lt;space>                    : "~"   asciitilde
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>In several places <CODE>asciicircum</CODE> is misspelled as <CODE>asciicirum</CODE></LI>
</UL>


Finally make sure your shells and/or applications are set up for
ISO-8859-1 compatibility as described in section 
<A HREF="#apps">International character sets in specific applications</A> and you should
be all set.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Making $ (the dollar sign), &oslash; (oslash) and &Oslash; (Oslash) work </A>
<!--Danish!setting up $, &oslash;, &Oslash;--></H2>

<H3>$ (the dollar sign) <!--Danish!setting up $--></H3>

<P>There is a bug in the Danish keymaps causing the dollar sign to be accessed
with <CODE>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;4&gt;</CODE> instead of <CODE>&lt;AltGr&gt;&lt;4&gt;</CODE>
by default. If this is a problem for you, determine what keymap you load at
boot-time. You can find it by looking around in the directory
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/</CODE> or simply by paying attention to what happens at boot-time.
On my computer the relevant keymap is called
<CODE>/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/dk-latin1.map</CODE>. You can fix the problem by
changing the line
<PRE>
keycode   5 = four             dollar           dollar          
</PRE>

in the keymap file to
<PRE>
keycode   5 = four             currency         dollar
</PRE>

and then (re-)loading the keytable as described in section
<A HREF="#loadkbd">Loading a keytable</A>. Currency (dansk: ``soltegn'')
is the default <CODE>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;4&gt;</CODE> character on a Danish keyboard. </P>
<P>This should fix the problem for both X11 and plain Linux.</P>

<H3>&oslash; (oslash) and &Oslash; (Oslash) <!--Danish!setting up &oslash;, &Oslash;--></H3>

<P>In some older distributions ``&oslash;'' and ``&Oslash;'' appear as cent and
yen. Find the line for keycode 40 in the keymap file and change it from 
<PRE>
keycode  40 = cent              yen
</PRE>

to
<PRE>
keycode  40 = +oslash           +Ooblique
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This bug appears to have been fixed in <CODE>kbd-0.88.tar.gz</CODE> and newer versions.</P>
<P>The plus signs are necessary to get <CODE>Caps Lock</CODE> working properly. ``Oslash''
can be used as an alias for ``Ooblique'' in <CODE>kbd-0.90.tar.gz</CODE> and newer
versions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Display and application setup </A><!--Danish!display configuration--><!--Danish!application configuration--></H2>

<P>Most applications need to be compiled as ``8-bit-clean'' to work well with
European characters. Some need a few extra hints to get it right.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Loading the ISO-8859-1 font on the console </A>

<P>Execute the following commands from your shell prompt:
<PRE>
setfont lat1u-16.psf
</PRE>
</P>
<P>In Red Hat Linux 5.2 and higher you can do this by adding these lines to
<CODE>/etc/sysconfig/i18n</CODE>:
<PRE>
SYSFONT=lat1u-16.psf
SYSTERM=linux
</PRE>

Due to a bug in the <CODE>ncurses</CODE> package on Red Hat Linux 5.2, you also
have to change ``linux-lat'' to ``linux'' in <CODE>/etc/profile.d/lang.sh</CODE>.
This is not necessary in Red Hat Linux 6.0.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 The Euro symbol </A>
<!--Danish!the Euro symbol--></H2>

<P>A new symbol has been added to the Danish character set: The symbol for the
Euro (the new currency of the European Monetary Union.) A new character set
called ISO-8859-15 a.k.a. latin0 (or latin9) has been created to replace
ISO-8859-1 (latin1.) You must use the 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.freshmeat.net/pub/euro-patch/">EURO</A> package to get support for
latin0. The package includes both fonts and keymaps.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Characters you can display under Linux </A>

<P>Dead keys should work under GNU emacs provided you use GNU emacs v19.30 or
higher and XFree86 v3.1.2 or higher (it works for me anyway,) so do not start
researching available elisp packages implementing ``electric keys'' or
anything like that. If you want to implement European keyboard conventions
in emacs without upgrading, the best choice is probably the <CODE>remap</CODE>
package available from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/pub/emacs/auctex/ftp/auctex/">SunSite DK</A>.
There are also two packages called <CODE>iso-acc.elc</CODE> and <CODE>iso-trans.elc</CODE>

First make sure that you install version 3.1.20 instead of version 4.0 of

download the sources for <CODE>ispell</CODE> at 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/pub/gnu/">the GNU archive</A>
and you can get a Danish dictionary from 
<A HREF="http://www.sslug.dk/ispell/idanish/dansk.html">SSLUG</A>. Follow
the compilation instructions and you should have no trouble (One caveat: When
defining the variables necessary for compilation you must tell ispell that
Linux is a SysV type OS by defining the variable <CODE>USG</CODE>.)</P>
<P>When you have installed the Danish dictionary for <CODE>ispell</CODE> you can check
the spelling of a Danish language file by executing the command:

There are several problems with TeX/LaTeX: You want LaTeX to understand
the special characters and you do not want LaTeX to put in English words
like ``Chapter'' at the beginning of every chapter or use English typesetting
conventions.</P>
<P>Under LaTeX2e the header of your input file should look something like this:
<PRE>
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{t1enc}
\usepackage[danish]{babel}
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The first <CODE>usepackage</CODE> statement ensures that LaTeX will interpret
European characters correctly, so you do not have to use escape codes for
European characters. The second one is not strictly necessary, but it is
recommended including it to use the new EC fonts (previously called DC
fonts.) The third <CODE>usepackage</CODE> statement defines a range of standards
for typesetting texts in Danish.</P>
<P>All the major Linux distributions now includes the <B>teTeX</B> package. To
set up teTeX you must run the script <CODE>texconfig</CODE>. Here you can choose
Danish hyphenation (dansk: ``orddeling''), A4 papersize for <CODE>dvips</CODE> and
<CODE>xdvi</CODE> etc.</P>
<P>All new Linux distributions include LaTeX2e, but on older systems you might
come across LaTeX 2.09. If that happens you can use 
<PRE>
\documentstyle[a4,isolatin]{article}
</PRE>

to include support for ISO-8859-1 characters and European paper sizes. A
better thing to do would be to ask your system administrator to upgrade
to LaTeX2e.</P>
<P><CODE>isolatin.sty</CODE> is available from all 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/pub/tex/ctan/">CTAN servers</A>.</P>
<P>Some people prefer to use emacs in a special mode which translates ``special''
letters into TeX escape codes, but this method is obsolete.</P>

<P>Denmark is placed in the Central European Time zone (CET or MET,) which (in
the winter) is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time plus 1 (GMT+1.) You set
the time zone on a Linux system by making a symbolic link between
<CODE>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</CODE> and the file in
<CODE>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/</CODE> with a name corresponding to your zone or
country. Danes will want to execute one of the commands 
<PRE>

</PRE>

or
<PRE>
ln -sf /usr/lib/zoneinfo/Europe/Copenhagen /etc/localtime

</P>
<P>This automatically sets Daylight Saving Time (GMT+2) in the summer.</P>
<P>You synchronize the system time with the CMOS clock by issuing the command
<CODE>clock</CODE> as root. If your CMOS clock is set to GMT (a.k.a. UTC --- the

<H2><A NAME="locale"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Locale support in libc 5.4.x and higher</A><!--Danish!locale support--></H2>

<P>The locale support has been updated in <CODE>libc 5.4.x</CODE>. You can avoid many of
the individual program setups described in section 
<A HREF="#apps">International character sets in specific applications</A> if the programs
on your system is prepared for locale support. The Debian distribution comes
with this support if you install the <CODE>wg15-locale</CODE> package. Systems with
<CODE>GNU libc 2</CODE> (<CODE>libc 6.x</CODE>) support locales by default (see remarks about
Red Hat Linux release 5.0 later in this section.)</P>
<P>If you use a system without locale support, you can add such support using the
following method:
<OL>
<LI>Make sure you have the latest <CODE>libc 5.4.x</CODE> library. You can get this
from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/">Yggdrasil Computing</A>.</LI>
<LI>Make sure you have the <CODE>localedef</CODE> program installed. It should come
with the library.</LI>
<LI>Get the locale sources. You can get them from DKUUG. You need to get
both 
<A HREF="ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/WG15-collection/locales/">locale</A>
and 
<A HREF="ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/WG15-collection/charmaps/">charmap</A>
sources.</LI>
<LI>Put the locale sources in <CODE>/usr/share/i18n/locales/</CODE> and the
charmap sources in <CODE>/usr/share/i18n/charmaps/</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Execute the <CODE>localedef</CODE> program to build the locale data files:
<PRE>
localedef -ci da_DK -f ISO_8859-1:1987 da_DK
</PRE>

(Note for non-Danish readers: You can build locale data files for other locales
in the same way. All locale and charmap sources are at the DKUUG site.)</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>To enable support for the Danish locale on a system with locale support you
just have to set one of the following environment variables:
<PRE>
LANG=da_DK
</PRE>

or
<PRE>
LC_ALL=da_DK
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Try <CODE>da_DK.ISO_8859-1</CODE> if <CODE>da_DK</CODE> does not work.</P>
<P>Both environment variables set all the individual locale catgories. You can
also set a single locale category by using the name of the category as an
environment variable. The locale catogories are:
<PRE>
Locale category         Application
---------------         -----------
LC_COLLATE              Collation of strings (sort order.)
LC_CTYPE                Classification and conversion of characters.
LC_MESSAGES             Translations of yes and no.
LC_MONETARY             Format of monetary values.
LC_NUMERIC              Format of non-monetary numeric values. 
LC_TIME                 Date and time formats.
LC_ALL                  Sets all of the above (overrides all of them.)
LANG                    Sets all the categories, but can be overridden
                        by the individual locale categories.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>In Red Hat Linux 5.2 you can set the environment variables LANG and/or
LC_ALL in the file <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/i18n</CODE> by adding lines such as
this:
<PRE>
LC_ALL=da_DK
</PRE>
</P>
<P>A few programs such as <CODE>bash</CODE> and <CODE>GNU emacs</CODE> still need specific
setup as described in section 
<A HREF="#apps">International character sets in specific applications</A>, but most
should work without further attention. Programs such as <CODE>nvi</CODE> which
did not work with 8 bit characters before should work now.</P>
<P>Locale support should be more common as distributions based on the new
<CODE>GNU libc 2</CODE> become available. Beware that although Red Hat Linux release
5.0 comes with <CODE>GNU libc 2</CODE>, the locale support is not working. You have to
build the locale data files by executing <CODE>localedef</CODE> yourself. You can build
the Danish locale data files with the following command:
<PRE>
localedef -c -i da_DK -f ISO-8859-1 da_DK
</PRE>
</P>
<P>As of <CODE>glibc-2.0.7-4.i386.rpm</CODE> the locale data files are included with the
libraries and this is no longer necessary.</P>

<H2><A NAME="programming"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Programming tips for X11</A><!--Danish!X programming--></H2>

<P>Displaying 8-bit charaters is easy. You can use them just as you would use
7-bit ASCII. Getting applications to accept input of special characters is 
an entirely different matter. </P>
<P>If you are using e.g. the Xt toolkit and a widget set like Motif you need
only add one line to your program. As your <B>first</B> call to Xt use
<CODE>XtSetLanguageProc</CODE>. Like this:
<PRE>
    int main (int argc, char** argv)
    {
        ...
        XtSetLanguageProc (NULL, NULL, NULL);
        top = XtAppInitialize ( ... );
        ...
    }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Now your program will automagically look up the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> variable
and interpret dead keys etc. according to the <CODE>Compose</CODE> tables in
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/</CODE>. This should work for all Western European
keyboard layouts and is entirely portable. As XFree86 multilanguage support
gets better your program will also be useful in Eastern Europe and the
Middle East.</P>
<P>This method of input is supported by Xt, Xlib and Motif v1.2 (and
higher.) According to the information I have available it is only partially
supported by Xaw. If you have further information on this subject I would like
to hear from you.</P>
