><P
> DSL, or Digital Subscriber Loop, is a high-speed Internet access technology
 that uses a standard copper telephone line (a.k.a. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop"</SPAN
> in
 telco parlance). DSL provides a direct, dedicated connection to an ISP via
 the existing telco network. DSL is designed to run on up to 80% of the
 telephone lines available in the United States. By using line-adaptive
 modulation, DSL is capable of providing data speeds of 8 Mbps or more. &#13;</P
><P
> DSL services are now being aggressively marketed for home and small business
 use. DSL is typically priced below ISDN, and well below T1 service, yet can
 provide potentially even greater speeds than T1 without the
 cost, complexity, and availability issues of T1. Since DSL is a dedicated,
 often <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"always on"</SPAN
> service, it avoids the delays and use charges
 that are common with ISDN. Making this quite a nice technology for the
 bandwidth starved masses.&#13;</P
><P
> While all this sounds exciting, DSL does have some drawbacks. The quality of
 the DSL signal, and thus the connection, depends on distance (the length of
 the copper <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop"</SPAN
>) and various other factors. Also, there is no
 such thing as standard <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DSL"</SPAN
>. There are various flavors of DSL,
 and many, many ways DSL providers are implementing their networks. In typical
 fashion, Linux users are often left to fend for themselves, since the DSL
 providers are often taking the easy way out, and catering only to
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"mainstream"</SPAN
> Operating Systems.&#13;</P
><P
> The topics included in this HOWTO include qualification and pre-installation,
 installation, configuration, troubleshooting and securing a DSL connection. As
 well as other related topics. There are also appendices including a
 comprehensive <A
HREF="#OVERVIEW"
>DSL Overview</A
>, <A
HREF="#FAQ"
>Frequently Asked Questions</A
>, a listing of <A
HREF="#LINKS"

>, and a <A
HREF="#GLOSSARY"

 are hopefully addressed to one degree or another with what can be a complex
 topic since it deals with networking, hardware, new fangled technologies, and 
 various approaches taken by various vendors. The core components of this
 document are:

    card installation.

    Security implications that are even more important with a full-time
    connection. Linux users seem especially targeted by crackers, because
    quite frankly, some don't understand how important security is, or don't
    understand the finer points of this. And who wants to <SPAN

 other contexts. Also, there is a <A

    Overview</A

HREF="#FAQ"
>FAQ</A

    of the puzzle fit together. DSL network implementations are more complex
    than traditional dialup networks.

    If you are not clear on what protocols are required, or what software you 
    need to have installed, also read the <A

><P
> 1.7: Added comments on ISDN line filters being different than POTS, 
 and other additions related to ADSL over ISDN in various places. Add another

 Removed the 'Linux Friendly ISP' section. The landscape has changed much
 since this section was started. Back then there were few options for DSL in
 many places, and all too often a non-compatible modem was the only thing
 available. Also, the advent of microfilters and self-installation has helped
 with the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"do-it-yourselfer"</SPAN
> approach, giving everybody more
 freedom. Then, maintaining this number of links was a PITA too. I still
 encourage new subscribers to shop their local markets if there are options.
 Many large ISPs and telcos have very poor ideas of what an Internet
 connection is and restrict severely what you can do with Linux. Or at least
 try to ;-) Updated LDP links to tldp.org (from linuxdoc.org).</P
><P
> 1.6: Several new Linux Friendly ISPs. Clarification on 
 problems with alarm systems. Minor touch ups to other sections, and fix some 
 broken links (never ending job :).&#13;</P
><P
> 1.5: New Tuning sub-section using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>iproute</SPAN
>. Hot
 stuff! Other additions to the Tuning section. A few new ISPs. Alcatel
 SpeedTouch USB section updates. Thanks to Alex Bennee for clarifying things.
 Other minor updates to FAQ, Glossary and Tuning.&#13;</P
><P
> 1.4: A few new and updated URLs, and catch ups. The Alcatel USB modem section
 is revamped. A few new ISPs.&#13;</P
><P
> Version 1.3: Updates to the SpeedTouch USB HOWTO in the appendix.
 Minor update to PPPoE section, and two new Linux Friendly ISPs. A feeble 
 attempt to make the document a little less U.S.-centric. Various minor 
 updates.</P
><P
> Version 1.2 adds PPTP configuration section for Alcatel ethernet modems.
 Also, added are two additional sections in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Tuning"</SPAN
> section
 for the TCP Receive window, and ADSL/DMT interleaving. And the big news is
 the release of open source drivers for the Alcatel USB modem as of March
 2001. There is an Alcatel SpeedTouch USB mini HOWTO in the <A
HREF="#SPEEDTOUCHUSB"
>appendix</A
> by Chris Jones. A number of 
 miscellaneous updates as well.
 
 </P
><P
> Version 1.1 included quite a few minor corrections, updates, 
 and additions. Not much that is substantially new. There are finally two
 Linux compatible DSL PCI modems from Xpeed. The drivers are now in the kernel
 2.2.18 source (not ported to 2.4 as of this writing 05/23/02).
 </P
><P
> Version .99 addresses some of the many changes that have occurred since the
 original ADSL mini HOWTO was published. Originally, ADSL was the primary DSL
 technology being deployed, but more and more some of the other DSL flavors
 are entering the picture -- IDSL, SDSL, G.Lite, and RADSL. Thus the renaming
 from <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ADSL mini HOWTO"</SPAN
> to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DSL HOWTO"</SPAN
>. There
 have been many other changes in DSL technology as well. PPPoE/A encapsulation
 has become more and more common as many ISPs are jumping on this bandwagon.

   Traditionally this is a building where one end of your phone line

   Essentially, you should think of your loop as one dedicated pair of copper
   wires that run uninterrupted from your residence or office directly to the
   CO. This is perhaps an oversimplification, but will serve our purposes. DSL

 all the work. In this scenario, the provider will send a kit in order to save
 them from sending a tech, and thus reducing cost. Typically, self install

 maybe a NIC), and a CDROM with drivers, etc. on it. In some cases, a splitter
 may be included instead of microfilters. In any case, some type of filtering

    line without dial-tone for DSL and Internet connectivity. Also, DSL
    services from CLECs (independent telcos like Covad), may use a
    dedicated line, depending on their line sharing agreement with the local 
    incumbent carrier. (Instead the CLEC will actually lease a loop from the

   Installing a splitter splits the line into two pairs, and filters the DSL
   signal from one of them. This results in a inside wiring scheme where DSL
   goes to only one jack, and then regular voice type service to all other
   jacks. This is considered by many to be a better type of installation than

   mounted near the NID, on the customer's side of the demarcation point.

   doing this is by placing RJ11 <SPAN

 Both have mechanisms for obtaining an IP address and other related networking

 you will waste a lot of time and effort. You cannot choose which one either.
 It is a matter of how the ISP is doing his network. Note that PPPoE can run
 over Bridged networks, so just knowing whether you are Bridged or not, is not
 necessarily good enough. If your provider is giving you a router, there is a
 good chance that the router's firmware will handle all of this for you. &#13;</P

 From the end user's perspective, it is often more work to set up, often uses
 more CPU, and the connection is maybe not as stable. So anyway, this seems to
 be the coming trend. Many of the large telcos around the world, especially
 the RBOCs (Baby Bells) in the U.S., have committed to PPPoX already. Setting
 up a PPPoX connection is completely different from setting up a bridged/DHCP
 connection.

 Essentially these are mini routers with built in modems. These are all
 ethernet based devices too, so Linux should be good to go here as well.
 Again, a compatible, working NIC should be all that is required to make this
 work.&#13;</P
><P

 A <SPAN

 connection management, IP encapsulation, and authentication, as well as
 providing a means of segregating your LAN from outside traffic, and possibly
 other features too. In short they can do it all. One big advantage is that
 they can handle whatever protocols your ISP requires in order to connect. &#13;</P
><P
> If the ISP is requiring PPPoX, then this makes life a little easier since you
 will not have to install or configure any additional software just to use
 their network. The modem's firmware will handle this. The downside is that
 most of these do not have the flexibility of a Linux router, or other
 software solution. Of course, you could set up a Linux router behind the
 router, and have the best of both worlds. The ones with more and better
 features are also going to cost significantly more.&#13;</P
><P
> While the physical installation of a router is very similar to the modem
 installation (see above), the router configuration itself is different
 since your first <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 the ISP's gateway. Routers will actually have two interfaces -- one that you
 connect to from the LAN side, and one that connects to your ISP on the WAN
 side. Your point of exposure here is the WAN interface of the router. &#13;</P
><P
> 
 The router will also have a pre-configured, private IP address that you will
 connect to from the LAN side. This will be your gateway. The public IP
 address will be assigned to the WAN side interface. Typically these devices
 also act as DHCP servers for the LAN side as well. So possibly all you have
 to do is to start a DHCP client such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dhcpcd</B
> or
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pump</B

 make sure the modem/router is syncing first. The appropriate steps and
 configuration should be in the owner's manual, or available from your
 provider. &#13;</P
><P
> If you are a PPPoX customer, and the router is handling this part of the
 connection, then you will have to configure at least your user id and
 password before connecting. If a Bridged/DHCP customer, you should just have
 to activate DHCP on the router, and possibly register the MAC (hardware
 address) of the router with your provider. Some routers have <SPAN

 cloning"</SPAN

 manufacturer's default setting for its IP address. See the owner's manual, or
 ask your provider. You will then have to set your NIC's interface to the same
 network as the router. For instance, if the router has an IP of 10.0.0.1, set
 your interface's address to 10.0.0.2 (typically eth0), and netmask to
 255.0.0.0. &#13;</P

 their TCP Receive Window (RWIN). But this is because it is too small to start

 The exception here is if you have to routinely deal with a high latency

 set too low, it can be a bottleneck and restrict throughput. The optimum 
 value for this depends completely on your bandwidth and latency. Latency being
 what you would find as average roundtrip time (RTT) based on
 <EM

 determined with <B

 32KB is acceptable up to speeds of 2 Mbps and a typical latency of 125ms or so,

 adversely effect throughput, so don't over do it.&#13;</P

 line encoding. DMT is now the standard for ADSL, and is by far and away the
 most prevalent form of ADSL. Interleaving buffers the raw data and corrects
 errors on the fly at the DSLAM. This can significantly help marginal loops
 that may be prone to line errors. The downside is that this buffering also adds
 significant latency to the connection. So for those with reasonable quality
 lines, interleaving is of no real benefit, and may actually add unnecessary 
 latency.&#13;</P

 How to know if your line is interleaved or not, and how to change it? Good
 question. Generally speaking, if your first hop or two on a traceroute is 
 less than 25ms or so, you can pretty much figure that interleaving is off. 
 But there may be other factors such as how far away those hops actually are.
 Unless your modem accurately reports this, the only other real way to know is
 to talk to someone at the telco. This may prove easier said than done.&#13;</P

 performance, particularly for interactive protocols (like telnet or ssh) and
 streaming protocols (like RealAudio), and increased latency for ICMP and

 saturated (since downstream data is queued at the ISP's end and we can't do
 as much about that). The queued traffic is processed such that lower volume
 traffic protocols (like ssh) often get drowned out so to speak, by the higher
 volume, bulk traffic (like http or ftp), as there isn't any special
 prioritizing in default usage.

 maintain the viability of the connection. Each end can send LCP echoes to other
 end, and if there is no response in the alloted time frame, the session is
 presumed dead, and is torn down. Again, either end can initiate this process.
 The client should then negotiate a new connection. But, this normally means a
 new IP address is assigned along with the new session. &#13;</P

 the remote end in this regard, you can adjust PPP's very flexible way of
 dealing with LCP echoes on your end, to increase the number of echoes, extend
 the interval and timeout period on your end. This might help prolong the life
 of an unstable connection in situations with marginal line conditions, or a
 buggy peer on the other end. Read your client's documentation. YMMV.&#13;</P

 network outages that tend to effect large numbers of users. Sync outages are
 a telco problem, not an ISP problem. If your service agreement is with the
 ISP, you will need to contact them, who will in turn contact the telco.

 For instance, a poor inside wire connection may result in retransmissions of
 packets that have been dropped. This can really reduce throughput and slow a
 connection down. It is tempting to think of packet loss as a traditional
 networking problem, but with DSL it is possible to be the result of a bad
 line, impaired signal, or even the modem itself.

><UL

><P
>   Power cycle the modem. Turn off the power button/switch, and physically
   unplug the cable to the wall jack for 30 seconds or so. Turn back on, and
   re-attach to the wall jack. This will force a resync. Unfortunately, the only
   way to power down a PCI modem, is to reboot. This may fix a 
   <SPAN

   maybe other conditions too.

   See the <A
HREF="#NOSYNC"

   lock, stock and barrel to the NID and thus bypassing all inside wiring.
   If the situation is improved there, then the problem is inside somewhere. If
   not, it is a telco problem.

>   RFI Bear-hunt: The DSL signal is fragile. There are a number of
   things that can degrade it.  RFI, or Radio Frequency Interference,
   from sources in and around the home/office is one common source of
   reduced signal strength, intermittent sync loss, low
   sync rates and high line error rates that can cause retransmissions and 
   slow things down. DSL frequencies just happen to be in a range that is 
   susceptible to many potential RFI sources. Our test tool here is simply a
   portable AM radio. Tune it to any channel where you can get clear reception
   -- it makes no difference where. The AM radio will pick up RFI that is in
   the same frequency range as the DSL signal. It will sound like
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"frying bacon"</SPAN
> type static. Put it against your computer's
   power supply. You should hear some static. Move it away and the static
   should fade pretty quickly. This will give you an idea of what RFI sounds
   like. A decent quality power supply should produce only weak RFI --
   probably not enough to cause a problem. Use the radio like a Geiger counter
   and move it around your modem and DSL line. If you hear static, follow it
   to the source. Things to be suspicious of: power supplies, transformers,
   ballasts, electric motors, dimmer switches, high intensity lighting. Moving
   the modem, or rerouting cables is sometimes enough. Keeping the line
   between the modem and the wall jack as short as possible is a good idea
   too.
 
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Chronic sync problems are often due to a line problem somewhere.
    Sometimes it is something as simple as a bad splice or corroded jack, and
    easily remedied if it can be found. Most such conditions can be isolated
    by a good telco tech. Check with your provider, and politely harass them
    if you have to. If you get the run-around, ask to go over their heads.

 able to help minimize the impact of this. YMMV.

 Then, any time you hit the Internet, there is some slight degradation of
 performance with each hop you take. Now this may not amount to much, as long
 as you are not taking too many hops and all the components -- your system,
 your ISP's network, your ISP's upstream provider, and the destination itself
 -- are all working like well oiled machines. But there's the rub -- how do
 you really know with so many variables in the mix? One flaky interface, on
 one router, on one hop along the path, may cause misleading results.&#13;</P
><P
> Your absolute max speed is going to be at your point of connection to your
 ISP -- the ISP's gateway. It can only go downhill from there, not up! So the
 ideal test is as close to home as possible. This eliminates as many unknown
 variables as possible. If your ISP has a local ftp server, this is an
 excellent place to run your own tests. (Run a traceroute though just to see
 how local it really is.) </P
><P

 If your ISP does not have this, look for an ftp site that is close -- the
 fewer the hops, the better. And look for one that isn't too busy, or you will
 get misleading results. Find a large file -- like 10 Megs -- and time the
 download. Try this over several days, and at different times of day. The
 server, and the backbone, are going to be busier at certain times of day,
 which can skew results and you want to eliminate these variables as much as
 possible. Your provider cannot compensate for heavy backbone traffic,
 backbone bottlenecks, slow or busy servers, etc. &#13;</P

 others, but take these with a grain of salt. There are just too many
 variables for these tests to reliably give you an accurate snapshot of your

><P
> DSL is a telephone loop technology that uses existing copper phones lines, 
 and provides a dedicated, high speed Internet connection. One of the big
 advantages of some DSLs (notably ADSL), are that they can co-exist on the
 same line with a traditional voice service such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"POTS"</SPAN
> (Plain
 Old Telephone Service), and even ISDN. This is accomplished by utilizing
 different frequency ranges above the voice range (voice is up to 4KHz).
 Essentially, this gives two lines in one: one for voice, and one for Internet
 connectivity. When all is working normally, there should be no interference
 between the two <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lines"</SPAN
>. This gives DSL a potentially broad
 consumer base, and helps minimize costs for service providers.&#13;</P
><P
> DSL is positioned for the Home and Small Office (SOHO) market that is 
 looking for high speed Internet access at reasonable prices. Since it also
 typically provides dedicated, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"always on"</SPAN
> access, it can be used
 for interconnecting low to mid range bandwidth servers, and provides a great
 access solution for small LANs. It is also great for those Linux power users
 that just want a fat pipe  :-).&#13;</P
><P
> Phone companies, and other independent telecommunications providers (CLECs),
 are now deploying DSL to stay ahead of the Cable
 companies -- the main consumer and SOHO competition for DSL providers. This
 mad rush to get <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a piece of the pie"</SPAN
>, is bringing much
 competition (a good thing!), much diversity, and some confusion, into the
 consumer market. The DSL provider (often, but not always, the phone company)
 will provide the DSL infrastructure. This would include your line, the DSLAM,
 and physical connection to the outside world. From there it is typically
 picked up by an ISP, who provides the traditional Internet services.
 </P
><P
> Consumer DSL plans are typically <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"best effort"</SPAN
> services. While
 boasting speeds approaching T1, and even surpassing that in some cases, it is
 not necessarily as reliable as T1 however. Business class DSL offers more
 reliability at a higher cost than consumer plans, and is a good compromise
 where both reliability and bandwidth are at a premium. All in all, the cost
 of DSL compared to traditional telco services, such as T1, is attractive and
 substantially more affordable for home and small business users.&#13;</P
><P
> DSL providers often do not have service contracts for home users,
 while business class DSL services typically do include similar SLAs (Service
 Level Agreements) to that offered for a T1 line.&#13;</P
><P
> The downside is that DSL is not available everywhere. Availability, and
 available bit rate (speed), are purely a function of where you live, where
 the telco has installed the prerequisite hardware, how far you are from the
 DSLAM/CO, and the quality of your phone line (loop). Not all loops are
 created equal, unfortunately. The primary limitation is distance.&#13;</P

   ADSL is far and away the most widely deployed consumer DSL, and was
   specifically developed for the home and SOHO markets. The higher downstream
   rates lends itself to those not running serious servers -- at least
   anything more than a small, personal web site. ADSL is capable of sharing
   data with a POTS (or ISDN) voice line, so an additional line is not
   required. A big selling point. ADSL, like other DSLs, is limited by
   distance. 18,000 ft (5.5 km) is a typical cut-off point for telcos. ADSL
   does typically require either a splitter or filters to isolate the DSL
   signal from POTS. Sometimes referred to as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"full rate"</SPAN
> ADSL in
   order to differentiate it from G.Lite DSL. There are two line encodings for
   ADSL: DMT and CAP. DMT (a.k.a. Alcatel compatible) has won the standards
   battle and is now the standard and the most common. Also, note that modems
   must be compatible with the encoding. In other words, a CAP modem will not
   work with a DMT service, and vice versa. Also, ISDN requires
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"modems"</SPAN
> (NTs), and related hardware such as filters, that are
   specific to that type of line since the signal on the line is very
   different for POTS and ISDN.

 DSLAMs come in various shapes and sizes, and are the one, single complex and
 costly component of a DSL connection. When a qualified phone line is
 connected to a modem at the user's end of the loop, a high speed digital
 connection is established, typically over ATM, or sometimes frame relay. The
 DSLAM splits the signal back into separate voice and data channels. The voice
 channel stays within the telco network, whereas the data is picked up by an

 distance to the DSLAM, quality of both inside and outside wiring, the loop
 wire gauge and various other factors within the loop.  Actual measurable,
 real world throughput, on the other hand, is first of all dependent on sync
 rate. Low sync rate means low throughput. In the above example, had the sync
 rate been lower, say 500 Kbps, then that would be the maximum for that
 connection, even though the customer is paying for a 1.5 Mbps service.</P

 Secondarily, throughput will depend also on the ISP's network, and then the
 ISP's upstream provider.  You will lose approximately 10-20% of potential
 throughput to networking overhead. In the above example where the connection
 is throttled at 1.5 Mbps, the actual, real-world maximum throughput would be
 somewhere around 1.2-1.3 Mbps when overhead is taken into account. Moreover,
 once you hit the Internet proper, all bets are off as there are any number of
 factors that may impact throughput. A overloaded or busy server is likely to
 be slow no matter how fast your DSL connection is. &#13;</P

 Zyxel, Cisco, 3Com, and Cayman have products available. Depending on model

> Are some modems better than others? Short, easy answer: no. Modems are not
 much of a factor in speed in most cases. But some do have enhanced features,
 such as diagnostics or the combo modem/routers. Ethernet modems are
 generally considered the most reliable. Fewer IRQ hassles, no buggy drivers,
 etc. So the fact that Linux users are mostly relegated to ethernet modems is
 a blessing in disguise really. Are any of these better than others? Hard to
 say since most of this is so new there is not enough of a track record to
 compare brands and models with any degree of assurance. In other words, any
 old external, ethernet modem should do -- provided it matches your
 provider's DSL, and is configured for that service. Remember, there can be
 differences here.&#13;</P

 All DSLs have distance limitations. ADSL is limited
 to a loop length of roughly 18,000 ft (5.5 km), but the actual cut off point
 will vary from provider to provider. The further away you are, the weaker the
 signal, and the potential for poor connections is greater. With ADSL, if you
 are within approximately 12,000 ft (3.7 km), you should be able to get at
 least 1.5 Mbps -- all other things being equal. IDSL has even greater reach,
 mainly because the maximum speed for IDSL is considerably lower at 144
 Kbps/144 Kbps.&#13;</P

> Still even if you're close enough, there are a number of potential
 impediments that may disqualify a line. Two such common impediments
 are load coils and bridge taps. These are aspects of the old telco
 infrastructure that once were deemed beneficial, but now are getting
 in the way of the newer, digital technologies.  
 Whether you hit a snag like this or not, is pretty much hit or miss.  Fiber
 anywhere in the loop is also a disqualifier. The provider may take steps to
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clean"</SPAN

 from provider to provider, and this will likely add additional time to the

> Once the line is <SPAN

 available depending on how strong a signal they think your line can handle.
 If you are marginal, you will not be qualified for the higher speed plans.
 And if price is a factor, having a tiered pricing structure is good also
 since the lower end plans are obviously less expensive. How this is
 structured also varies wildly from provider to provider. Since, DSL is a new
 service, and providers are trying to find the right price/feature
 combinations that will attract the most users and thus gain a competitive
 edge.

 to <SPAN

   This is akin to asking if Linux works with telephones. The technology
   itself does not care. So, the short answer is <SPAN

   Not having a compatible modem option available is one common gotcha. Also,
   if the telco or ISP is doing the installation, they may require a Windows
   or Mac system to be available. This saves them the costs of training their
   techs on various alternative OSes. Buyer beware!

    management protocol at heart, that requires a user to initiate a

    particularly mature protocols either. They do not have much of a history
    or track record. Some would say the telcos and hardware manufacturers have
    rushed this out the door. PPPoE also requires an additional layer of
    software just to maintain the connection. This is one more layer of code
    and one more potential point of failure. Also, more system overhead is
    utilized to manage the connection.
    
   </P

>    The impact of the disconnect problem can potentially be eased by adjusting 
    the PPP LCP-echo settings to extend the period before the local end of

   of error correction that is configurable at the DSLAM. The side effects are
   a slower connection, especially higher latency. With FastPath (or sometimes 
   called non-interleaved) DMT, gateway pings can be in the 10-25 ms range. With 
   interleaving, this is more likely to be in the 40-75 ms range depending on 
   the degree of interleaving that has been enabled.
   
  </P

   errors with interleaving. Many telcos have interleaving on by default since
   increased stability would seem to be a good thing. But this is only

   for this. Some telcos may be amenable to turning this feature on/off. YMMV.

    for mid range Pentiums by some ISPs.

    radio signal interference from a nearby station, bridge taps on your
    line, excessive distance from the DSLAM and so on. Not to mention possible

   And then you need someone on the other end who is willing to provide 
   the bandwidth and whatever services may be needed. Not all DSL modems
   support this (some common SDSL modems apparently do). This is also going to
   require dealing with the local phone company for something that is not a

><P
>   Q: Why does DSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/7.1M/20M/etc) options?
  </P
><P
>   The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop. It works
   great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge for higher 
   performance signals like DSL. Remember that the distance of a loop is
   inversely proportional to the data rate that it can carry. Rate adaptive
   technologies are great for making a digital signal work in many situations,
   but it can't provide a consistent bandwidth for all applications,
   especially for very long (over ~15,000 ft) loops. The different bandwidths
   that you see advertised reflect various marketing battles of vendors
   equipment, and the telco struggle to finalize on a standard set of data
   rates. The bottom line is for the telco to be able to reach as broad a
   customer base as possible.

><P
>   Q: What are all these loop impairments (bridge taps, load coils, DLCs) that
   could disqualify my line from DSL? (thanks to Bruce Ediger) 
  </P
><P
>   Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
   characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals energy
   from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically only used
   in very long (&#62; 9,000 ft) phone lines.
  </P
><P
>   By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods, the
   phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps these
   customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
   "spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
  </P
><P
>   DLCs, Digital Loop Carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more
   than one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
   frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
   divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
   general term is "pair gain".
  </P
><P
>   These things cause different problems for high-frequency communications.
  </P
><P
>   Load coils will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
   passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
   allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
   interfere with the next byte's.
  </P
><P
>   Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
   signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if they're
   about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass particular
   frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might get shunted back,
   rather than passed along to the receiving modem, reducing bandwidth for that
   telephone line.
  </P
><P
>   Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one
   transmission in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones
   of a DMT transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.

   Reeve, , IEEE Press 1992, ISBN 0-87942-274-2 covers the math of how to

   characteristics of a telephone line.  It's pretty expensive, however.

><P
>    Q. Can I run a web server with my DSL connection?
  
  </P
><P
>   Sure. You are connected to a TCP/IP network, so theoretically you can run 
   any service that the protocols allow -- mail, ftp, ssh, irc, etc. Where
   there may be problems, is with the ISP's TOS (Terms of Service). Some ISPs
   are pretty open on this, while others forbid any type of server, and may
   even block certain ports. You should research this, or ask the ISP before
   making any plans. ISPs that are selling a consumer service are not
   going to allow any high volume servers -- just personal, or low traffic
   services at best. If this does not fit the bill, then you can check with 
   any local Business class DSL providers. This will cost more, but the 
   Terms of Service, and guarantees, are generally much more suited to 
   higher bandwidth usages.

>8.3.1. Cable Modem vs DSL</A
></H4
><P
> The Telcos see DSL as a competitor to the Cable Company's Cable
 Modem, and as such, are providing competitive pricing and configuration
 offerings. Although Cable Modems are advertised as having 10-30Mbps potential 
 bandwidth, they use a shared transmission medium with many other users on the
 same line, and therefore performance may vary, sometimes greatly, with the amount
 of traffic, time of day, and number of other users on the same node. But YMMV.&#13;</P
><P
> It is often heard that DSL has an advantage in that it is a private pipe to
 the Internet, with dedicated bandwidth. This is mostly a myth. You do have a
 private pipe to the DSLAM, but at that point, you enter the telco's ATM (or
 frame relay) network, and start sharing bandwidth. You are at the mercy of
 how well your DSL provider and ISP manage their networks. The consensus seems
 to be that DSL providers and ISPs are mostly doing a better job of managing
 bandwidth than the Cable companies. It is easier for them to add and adjust
 bandwidth as needed to meet demand. You are less likely to have speed
 fluctuations due to other users being on line at the same time. But, again,
 this gets down to how well the specific network and bandwidth are managed.&#13;</P
><P
> DSL probably has a small security advantage too. With most Cable modem
 networks, it is like being on a big LAN. You are sharing your connection (and
 bandwidth) right at the point of connection. But if you are not doing
 something to filter incoming connections already, you are asking for trouble
 either way. And, the cable companies are addressing this now, with more 
 secure approaches. This should not now be a major deciding factor.</P
><P
> There also seems to be a better chance of having ISP alternatives with DSL
 than Cable. At least, in the U.S. this is true. Choice is a good thing, and
 so is competition. It seems most Cable outfits give you just one choice for
 an ISP. If you don't like it, you are out of luck. The number of options with
 DSL probably varies greatly by geographic areas. Populous areas, like
 Northeast U.S., seem to have many options. </P
><P
> So which is better? The differences aren't as much with the technology, as they
 are with the implementations. If you look around, you can find plenty of
 horror stories on either. And plenty of happy customers too. The way
 to know what may be the best for you, is to do comparative shopping based on
 experiences of other users in your area. Don't base your choice on one
 person's opinion. This is statistically invalid. Likewise, don't base your
 choice on someone's opinion who has had a particular service for only a short
 time. Again, statistically not worth much. Get as many opinions from those
 that are using the <EM
>exact same services</EM
> that you are
 looking at.

 instead of the traditional telco copper lines. While the fiber is a definite
 problem for DSL services, it has it's own potential advantages. Existing
 fiber is potentially capable of 100 Mbps, and it looks like this could easily
 go up soon. 
 </P
><P
> So while telco fiber customers are being shut out of the DSL market 
 (since DSL is a copper only technology), they may have much to look forward
 to. Technologies are under development, and in some cases just now being
 deployed, to take advantage of fiber telco phone loops. Known as
 <SPAN

 can offer. The speeds are sufficient for VoD (Video on Demand) and VoDSL
 (Voice over DSL), and other high bandwidth services. One nice advantage here
 is, that since there is no DSL signal on the wire, the only required CPE is a
 network card. In other words, no modem -- just connect a NIC to the wall jack
 and off you go! This will also allow the telco to provide other digital
 services such digital TV. &#13;</P

 some inherent problems with the current state of this technology that may prevent
 it from becoming a major player in the near term however. Weather can still
 impact the wireless signal -- heavy cloud cover or rain for instance. Also,
 there is some pretty hefty latency if the uplink is via satellite. Surely
 these drawbacks will improve over time. But how soon?

> What I did is setup a Linux router (Redhat Linux 5.0  on a i486) with two
 ethernet interfaces. One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway (eth0 in
 above example), and the other interface (eth1 above) goes to a hub (or switch)
 and then connects the LAN with private network addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.x).
 Using the private network addresses behind your router/firewall allows some
 additional security because it is not directly addressable from outside. You
 have to explicitly masquerade your private addresses in order to connect to
 the Internet from the LAN. The LAN hosts will access the Internet via the
 second NIC (eth1) in the Linux router. Just set their gateway to the IP
 address of the second NIC, and assign them addresses on the same network.&#13;</P

></H2
><P
> The Alcatel SpeedTouch USB modem is one of a very few non-ethernet modems with 
 Linux drivers. This modem is quite popular in Europe (Alcatel's home turf),
 and is widely used elsewhere as well. Hats off to Alcatel!&#13;</P
><P
> For this to work, you will essentially need three things: the Alcatel modem 
 firmware and management utility (supplied directly by Alcatel in 
 closed source, binary form), a properly configured kernel and PPP daemon,
 and the Linux modem driver and related configuration. The modem driver itself
 is open source. There are currently two distinct, unrelated drivers available.&#13;</P
><P
> When drivers were first released, the installation process required a fair
 amount of patching and rebuilding to make things work. Since then, things
 have progressed, and it can now be done without any patching (see below). 
 How well all the pieces go together may depend on how old your Linux
 installation is, the kernel and PPP versions, and possibly what patches your
 vendor may have applied to their own packages. Recent Linux releases
 <EM
>probably</EM
> have most, if not all, of this already done,
 and hence you may not need to do any patching. I believe this is true of
 recent SuSE, Mandrake, and Debian (and probably others as well). You still
 need the Alcatel binary firmware, and a driver for the modem (if
 your distro does not include this). I would suggest checking your distro's
 web site, and search their archives for documents relating to this modem, and
 go from there as a first step. YMMV.&#13;</P
><P
> One obvious requirement is a kernel with USB support. USB and ATM support are
 better in recent kernels, and I would suggest if not using a very current
 Linux distribution, then at least get a recent kernel. And a quick note 
 on kernels and patching: if using the kernel source supplied with a Linux 
 distribution, it is most likely very heavily patched already. Applying
 patches to these can be hit or miss. </P
><P
> As always with Linux, there is more than one way to skin a cat. This is 
 true of this modem and is resulting in some confusion since there
 are various documents circulating on this modem with various approaches
 taken. Some are more current than others too. Keep this in mind if you run
 into conflicting recommendations. Again, your distribution is probably the
 best source of documents.</P
><P
> There are two separate driver projects for this modem. The installation 
 and configuration are completely different, as is the code base. Both are
 open source and GPL. One is a kernel module solution, originally developed by
 Alcatel, and now maintained by Johan Verrept. His HOWTO is located at <A
HREF="http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/SpeedTouch/howto.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/SpeedTouch/howto.html</A
>.
 I think most would agree that the installation of this driver is the more
 complex of the two, and more than likely will require some patching (unless
 your distro has already done this). But, it may have some slight performance
 benefits since it runs mostly in kernel space. 
 
 This driver can potentially support both PPPoE and PPPoA connections. &#13;</P
><P
> The other driver is by Benoit Papillault and friends. This one has a less
 complicated installation, and can be done with <EM
>no
 patching</EM
>. All the important parts here are done in user space. For
 inexperienced users, or just plain ease of use, this may well be the most painless
 way to go. The home page is <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/speedtouch"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sourceforge.net/projects/speedtouch</A
>
 and related docs are <A
HREF="http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/docs.php"
TARGET="_top"
>http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/docs.php</A
>.
 This driver can also work with 2.2 kernels (2.2.17 or later). PPPoE is not
 an option with this driver at this time. This driver also does not use 
 the management utility that is part of the Alcatel supplied binary package. 
 It extracts the modem firmware, and then does its own
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"management"</SPAN
>, so less dependent on proprietary code. Mandrake is
 reportedly including an RPM of this driver now.&#13;</P
><P
> Since this modem potentially supports both PPPoE and PPPoATM connections,
 which one is better? Which ever is supported by your ISP, and then 
 which ever works best for you! If your ISP supports both (some do and 
 some don't), you might try each approach and make your own decision. 
 There is no absolute right or wrong on such things. There are just too 
 many variables. Theoretically at least, PPPoA should utilize a little 
 less overhead and system resources.&#13;</P
><P
> There are other USB modems on the market that use an Alcatel chipset, 
 such as the Efficient Networks 4060. Do not expect either of these drivers to
 work with other modems. They won't. You should get a compatible ethernet 
 modem in such situations. There are other USB modems with Linux drivers also.
