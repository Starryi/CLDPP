This can be when: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>you have no more access to your computer, with the "no operating system" message; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>you have installed a new system (i.e., MS Windows) and you see no more Linux, and MS Windows takes up all the capacity of the disk; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>you have just partitioned the wrong drive with fdisk (for example, in the process of changing your hard drive). </p></li></ul></div><p>Here, you will learn that, if you know the right thing and do it, Linux comes usually safe from such things. MS Windows can, but it's luckier. </p><p>We will first see what you can do <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the problem to ease future recovery, and what you must do <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> to recover. There is little to do to prevent from erasing a disk; usually this is done by automatic MS Windows or Linux-install ill-behaved programs or users' mistakes - nothing can be done to prevent this, except care, but you are already careful, aren't you? </p><p>It can also be done by the use of MS-DOS/Windows fdisk. Avoid it as most as you can, but you probably can't. </p><p>I have done this many times, on my computer and on other guys' computers, and restored Linux most of the time and MS Windows sometimes. I wish you luck! </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm57"></a>2.2. What to do right now?</h3></div></div></div><p>If you don't have any problem yet, if you read this by curiosity or are just seeking information, and you are on a running Linux system, do immediately the following : </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>open a root terminal or xterm; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>key in <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/fdisk -l</strong></span> (that last character being l for Lima). Then do <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -u -l</strong></span>; </p></li></ul></div><p>You will be gratified to see a list of all current partitions, on all disks present on your computer. The second one gives the listing in units of sectors, in place of cylinders, and this is sometimes necessary. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Write this back on paper (or do "<span class="command"><strong>/sbin/fdisk -l | lpr</strong></span>" and "<span class="command"><strong>/sbin/fdisk -u -l | lpr</strong></span>" to print it) and save it in a safe place for future use. If you are not the system administrator, you should not be concerned by the problem, and can stop reading this. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm73"></a>2.3. Legal stuff</h3></div></div></div><p>This HOWTO is Copyright (c) 2000-2008 by Jean-Daniel Dodin. As of November 2003, the licence is LGPL. </p><p>I am not responsible of any damage on any computer as a result of anyone reading this HOWTO. If you do any damage, <span class="emphasis"><em>it is YOUR fault, NOT MINE</em></span>! Be careful when partitioning disks, and don't make any mistakes, because it can be fatal! Backup all your important data and check that everything you do is correct! What is described here worked on my computer, but it may or may not work on your computer. Although it should work for everyone, I can't guarantee anything. This is the last warning you get: BACKUP IMPORTANT DATA! Or, to put it concisely: Use at your own risk! </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm78"></a>2.4. What do I need to know right now?</h3></div></div></div><p>You <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to know that, in case of any major problem with your hard disk, you <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to stop using it in <span class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> mode, at least until the time for you to understand what's happening. Information there is very volatile... </p><p>If ever, one morning, awaking, your computer says "can't load, no system installed", you <span class="emphasis"><em>must not begin reinstalling all the stuff</em></span>. </p><p>If you have MS Windows installed, I can't promise you can recover your data, but it's likely you will recover all your Linux stuff, provided it's not located too low (near the beginning of the disk) in the disk structure. This is because some MS Windows viruses erase the very first disk cylinder, whatever is on. However I didn't ever experiment with such viruses, and can't say for sure. Try recovering, anyway. </p><p>You must also know that I give you all this information only for this - information purposes. Neither I nor any other people but you can be held responsible for any problem your data can have using this info. There are too many different systems on the world for anybody being able to promise anything. I can only wish you luck and hope that you, like me, will be happy recovering data. </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm88"></a>3. Technical info</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm90"></a>3.1. Disks</h3></div></div></div><p>A hard disk is made of sectors numbered from 0 to the max. </p><p>dmesg gives, for example: </p><pre class="screen">hdb: ST34321A, 4103MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=523/255/63</pre><p>CHS means Cylinders, Heads, Sectors. </p><p>523*255*63=8401995 sectors of 512 bytes, thus the 4103 MB. This is only a logical map; it's not necessarily what is written on the disk cover (except for the total size). </p><p>The true size of the sectors is of no interest for us, given that we don't want to modify anything, but merely wish to restore a previous state. For us, the default size given by fdisk is all right. </p><p>The size seen by the system is directly dependent on the work of the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System - the PC's ROM). The mode of the hard disk indicated in the BIOS is essential. On a new disk, it's better to use BIOS automatic hard disk recognition and say "yes". Anyway, any modification at this level may destroy all the data of the disk, so don't play with this without essential reason. </p><p>This is probably what your disk already uses, so don't be afraid. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm100"></a>3.2. Partitions</h3></div></div></div><p>Disk are now huge -- 500 GB drives are not rare -- so it's not really handy to have all this stuff packed in only one part. Only MS Windows does so, and, if you use Linux, maybe it's because you are aware of how inefficient the other is. </p><p>So a hard disk is usually cut in some pieces called "partitions" (see the <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/index.html" target="_top">Partition HOWTO</a> for details, also read <span class="emphasis"><em>README.fdisk</em></span> on the web or on your disk - location vary). </p><p>Let's get a look at (part of) my own print of <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -l</strong></span> : </p><pre class="screen">Disk /dev/hdb: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 523 cylinders

This partition table is located in the Master Boot Record (MBR), side by side with the boot loader. </p><p>Any misuse of the MBR by any of the OS's leads to problems. When trying to install any system, a "yes" answer at a question like "automatic partitioning?" is likely to give problems... This is specially true with MS Windows, and especially with custom MS Windows installations made by special makes' PCs (when no true "Windows" CD is included, as with many laptops). But it's also true with some "smart" (not so smart!) Linux installation programs included with some distributions (hopefully this is not more the case in 2008). </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm122"></a>4. Solving the problem</h2></div></div></div><p>Please, beware! Following the explanations given here will lead you to revert back to a previous system, losing all your recent changes, if any! You must choose... </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm125"></a>4.1. The simpler case</h3></div></div></div><p>All is simple if you have at hand: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A disk (floppy, usb key or CD) able to start Linux by itself with fdisk available - most rescue disks of any distribution can do that; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A paper with the <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -l</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -u -l</strong></span> content written down. </p></li></ul></div><p>It's enough to: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Start Linux; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Start <span class="command"><strong>fdisk /dev/hda</strong></span> (or whatever is the disk to rescue); </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use fdisk to delete (d option) all the existing partitions on the damaged disk; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use fdisk to create all the primary (1 - 4) partitions mentioned on the paper; </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Give them the appropriate tag (t option) : 82 is for Linux swap, 83 for Linux main (L gives you the list), 5 is extended and must be done before creating logical partitions, c is MS Windows FAT32, and f is MS Windows extended when 6 is MS Windows FAT16. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create any logical partition. </p></li></ol></div><p>On my SUSE installation and any time I had to do this for other people, this has produced good results. </p><p>However, I said that some fdisks may cut partitions on a sector basis, not cylinder. So the <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -u -l</strong></span> version of the paper. </p><p>For using the <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -u -l</strong></span> listing one must start <span class="command"><strong>fdisk -u</strong></span> :-). In my opinion, using sector limit is a very bad idea, but it may have a real use I'm not aware of. The problem is that, with cylinder limit, it's easy to guess even if you don't have paper. With sector one, there are many more guesses... </p><p>fdisk is a small and very smart programs. There are many other makes of fdisk, but I always prefer the bare bones one. (I speak of Linux ones, of course, not the others....) </p><p>Be aware that fdisk doesn't write anything to disk before you hit w and return. If you fear a mistake, hit q (quit) or Ctrl C (^C) to quit safe without saving changes. </p><p>When your new partition table is written, start your Linux. It's possible you might not be able to do that as usual: lilo/grub may have been damaged also, and you thus may need a boot floppy or CD. Choose the option "booting the installed partition".  </p><p>If you are accustomed to booting with lilo, as soon as you are logged in as root, key in "lilo" and hit return to reinstall your favourite boot loader. Right now, I'm not sure that the same thing is as easy with GRUB, but it should not be very difficult, either. </p><p>Your Linux should be all here; test it. Try, also, to start MS Windows if applicable. If you can't, there is a (very small) chance you can read your data from Linux, maybe with a raw sector-by-sector read. If you can identify the disk sectors your data is on, using dd you can copy it to a file. This is wise for text only. This recovery is NOT in the scope of this mini-HOWTO. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm161"></a>4.2. A not-so-simple case</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm163"></a>4.2.1. By hand</h4></div></div></div><p>This is when the previous case can't be used, for lack of fdisk paper, or if it won't work for use of an out-of-date one. </p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Warning</strong></span> </p><p>You can only try <span class="emphasis"><em>primary</em></span> partitions with no fear. <span class="emphasis"><em>logical</em></span> partition uses ordinary sectors of the disk to store their own housekeeping data, so, each time you write some logical partition with fdisk, you write some sectors, erasing the data content, if any. There is still a chance you don't have any data there or the data is unimportant, but, the less often you do such tries, the better. </p><p>First, be aware that as soon as you don't write to the disk (except with fdisk), you don't erase your data, so that you can use a block-by-block try. That is you need to know the beginning of the partition to start it. If, say a 153 doesn't fit, try a 154, and so on. </p><p>This can be tiresome, but, if you remember approximately the size of the Linux partition, there is a chance to win. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm173"></a>4.2.2. Linux's own info and other hacks</h4></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm175"></a>4.2.2.1. Kernel</h5></div></div></div><p>If you just destroyed your own partition table, but have not rebooted Linux: Don't reboot!

Primary partition(1)
type: 131(0x83)(Linux ext2 filesystem)
size: 1200mb #s(2457880) s(63-2457942)
chs: (0/1/1)-(152/254/61)d (0/1/1)-(152/254/61)r
Primary partition(2)
type: 007(0x07)(OS/2 HPFS, NTFS, QNX or Advanced UNIX)
size: 1200mb #s(2457880) s(2457944-4915823)
chs: (152/254/63)-(305/253/60)d (152/254/63)-(305/253/60)r
Primary partition(3)
type: 131(0x83)(Linux ext2 filesystem)
size: 1004mb #s(2056256) s(4919781-6976036)
chs: (306/61/49)-(434/60/47)d (306/61/49)-(434/60/47)r
Primary partition(4)
type: 000(0x00)(unused) size: 0mb #s(0) s(0-0) chs: (0/0/0)-(0/0/0)d (0/0/0)-(0/0/0)r</pre><p>As you see, primary partition can be recovered, but, for extended ones, it's still to be done. </p><p>DOS partitions are labelled "Windows NTFS" because they were created while trying to install MS Windows 2000 (a very awful experience in year 2000!).
