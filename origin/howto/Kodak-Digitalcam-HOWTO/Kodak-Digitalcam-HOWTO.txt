Kodak Digital Camera HOWTO


David Burley

The purpose of this document is to help one get their Kodak digital camera
working under GNU/Linux. The scope of the document may change at any time to
include more camera models. As of the current version this document does
support some other models than ones sold under the Kodak name. However those
are only mentioned as they work with the same steps that similar Kodak cameras
use. This document is not likely to grow to support all digital cameras as
there are simply too many to document in one HOWTO.

* Fixes for the LinuxDoc->DocBook DTD change that went unnoticed
* Additional information regarding drivers for other Operating Systems (Kodak
  didn't used to have them up on the web)
* Various other changes

October 8, 2000--

* IrDA support (This is not for the faint of heart and is only tested with a
  DC-265 but should also work with a DC-290 and maybe others with IrDA support)

October 4, 2000--

* Many updates, contacted Kodak for permission to include some copywritten
  information, etc. etc.

August 22, 2000--

* Updated for new OpenDiS release and the Python script.

January 18, 2000--

* TODO added
* Removal of kernel 2.2.13 section due to new USB backport release for 2.2.14.
  Replaced with a section for kernel 2.2.14. Please view previous HOWTO
  versions for information regarding older kernels
* Removal of kernel 2.3.36 section due to newer developmental kernels, replaced
  with kernel 2.3.39. Please view previous HOWTO versions for information
  regarding older kernels.
* Added a section detailing use of a Compact Flash PC Card Adapter

January 9, 2000--

* Document modified for release of OpenDiS 0.0.3-pre6

January 4, 2000--

2. Background


2.1. Digital Camera Technology--How Things Work

Digital cameras work with the same basic concept as a traditional camera. They
have a viewfinder or LCD screen to show the image prior to taking a photograph,
a lens with a shutter behind it to allow the light from the subject to hit a
light sensitive material. However, this is where most of the similarities end.
Digital cameras use a CCD (Charged Coupled Device) to sense the colors of the
light and their intensity. The CCD can be likened to a very find piece of
graphing paper, with thousands of little squares (transistors) to which sense
the differences between the colors. There are three types of transistors used
in commonplace CCDs, red, green and blue. Each transistor then passes the color
and intensity it sensed to and Analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ADC then
converts the information passed to it by the transistors into a digital format,
or binary 1's and 0's. The digital output of the ADC is then passed to a
Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The DSP adjusts the contrast and other image
details to get the perfect look and then compresses the data into a file format
like JPEG (Joint Photographics Expert Group).
Digital cameras may also have the ability to do an optical or a digital zoom on
an image. An optical zoom is when a lens is used to get a closer look at the
subject. A digital zoom is used to enhance the optical zoom for a larger image
even though the maximum size has been attained via optical zoom. Even though an
image can be resized later, it is suggested to use the built in digital zoom of
the camera at this point before any compression has been done to the image.
File formats like JPEG tend to degrade in quality when resized more so then
when the image is resized by the camera's software. This is due to artifacts
left behind from the compression.
A good resource for definitions of the terms used above is http://
photo.askey.net/articles/glossary/ Please refer there for more information.
Kodak also has a good site with much information on how things work, http://
www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/dlc/.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2. Kodak Digital Camera Product Line

The technical specifications for the cameras in the Kodak Digital Camera
product line have been attained from owners of the cameras and from third party
web sites. None of the information in this section has been taken or compared
to any Kodak documentation or their web site. Please submit missing and or
incorrect information not obtained from copyrighted Kodak materials to
khemicals@marblehorse.org. This information is useful to not only track the
progression of digital cameras and as a comparison tool but also for many other
technical uses.

2.3. Communicating With Digital Cameras


2.3.1. RS232 Communications In a Nutshell

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.2. USB Communications In a Nutshell

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.3. IrDA Communications In a Nutshell

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Communicating With the DC-Series Cameras

The below sections are specific to camera models and/or groups of camera
models. A particular camera model may be listed in more than one section as it
may be supported by more than one method. One method may be easier than another
and a specific method may meet your needs better. Select the method used
carefully and read all the options before choosing one, it could save a lot of
time later on.
If a PC-Card reader is available, or a laptop computer with one built in,
following the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter/PCMCIA-ATA Storage Card should be
generic enough to work on almost all Kodak DC-Series Cameras and many non-Kodak
digital cameras. Be aware that there are adapters for almost all memory devices
used in digital cameras to another more common technology. Floppy Disk adapters
for smart memory cards may work for cameras that use smart memory cards. These
methods also tend to offer fast data transfer rates and are the preferred
method of many.
Although something may not be mentioned as to working with a particular piece
of software don't assume that means the camera does not work with the software
package. Often a camera works with the protocols other digital cameras use and
past methods will work. If one finds a method works that is not mentioned in
the HOWTO don't neglect to send in the information to this documents author,
David_Burley.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. DC40, DC50, DC120, DC200, DC210

All of these cameras provide mechanisms for data transfer via standard RS232
serial port. This section is tailored to those who wish to use their digital
camera with the kdpci application. The following steps are untested, however
there is no reason for them to not work. If one finds that the steps do or do
not work please send a report to David_Burley so that the status may be noted
here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.1. Serial Camera Control

Additional notes regarding transfer of data from these cameras using RS232
serial support will be added in a future version of this HOWTO. All GNU/Linux
distributions should be configured in such a way with a default install that
serial communications with the camera should not require any kernel
configuration at all. See the kdcpi portion of the Software section for more
information regarding use and configuration of kdcpi.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. DC20, DC25, DC200+, DC210, DC210+ Zoom, DC215, DC220, DC220+, DC240,
DC260, DC265, DC280, DC290

All of the cameras provide mechanisms for data transfer via standard RS232
serial port. Some of the cameras provide mechanisms for data transfer via USB
(universal serial bus). This section is tailored to those who wish to use their
digital camera with gPhoto. Please refer to the gPhoto portion of the Software
section of this document for more information pertaining to application usage.
The following steps are untested, however there is no reason for them to not
work. If one finds that the steps do or do not work please send a report to
David_Burley so that the status may be noted here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. Serial Camera Control

Additional notes regarding transfer of data from these cameras using RS232
serial support will be added in a future version of this HOWTO. All GNU/Linux
distributions should be configured in a such a way with a default install that
serial communications with the camera should not require any kernel
configuration at all. See the gPhoto portion of the Software section for more
information regarding use and installation of gPhoto.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.2. USB Camera Control

There are no special drivers or kernel changes needed to support the DC220,
DC260, DC265 and DC290 cameras under this configuration. gPhoto contains the
necesary drivers to support USB transfer from these cameras. However if the
dc2xx kernel module is loaded it may be necesary to remove it else a resource
busy error may occur. To remove the module run the following command:


  bash# /sbin/rmmod dc2xx


Attempting to remove the module even if it is not loaded will not cause any
harm, so it is suggested that one remove it before starting gPhoto and
connecting to the camera via USB. See the gPhoto portion of the Software
section for more information regarding use and installation of gPhoto.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3. DC220, DC260, DC265, DC290 (HP Photosmart C500?)

The cameras provide mechanisms for data transfer via standard RS232 serial
port, USB (Universal Serial Bus) and IrDA (infrared) interface. Additionally,
images may be offloaded from the camera through the removal of the camera's
Compact Flash Card and use of a Compact Flash PC Card Adapter in a PC Card
reader or notebook PC Card slot. Currently these cameras are supported by
OpenDiS for USB, IrDA and Serial data transfer. For usage examples and
information on how to install and configure the application to work with the
cameras, refer to the Open Digita Services portion of the Software section.
Please note that the steps below have only been verified to work with the Kodak
DC-265; reports of other models that work with the same steps should be sent to
David_Burley. There is no reason the steps should not work for all digital
cameras that run DigitaOS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.1. Serial Camera Control

Additional notes regarding transfer of data from DigitaOS enabled cameras using
RS232 serial support will be added in a future version of this HOWTO. All
distributions should be configured in such a way with a default install that
serial communications with the camera should not require any kernel
configuration at all. See the OpenDiS and/or Digita Operating Environment -
- Command Device Protocol Python Script portion of the Software section for
information regarding serial camera control.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.2. 2.2.x Kernel USB Support

This section only applies to those running a 2.2.x series kernel. For those
running a 2.4.x series kernel skip this section. At the moment the USB
implementation in the 2.2.x series is insufficient and substantially out of
date. As such, most USB devices are unsupported natively with the included
drivers. However there is a patch available for the 2.2.15 - 2.2.17 kernels.
What software is needed (if not already present):

  1. usb-2.4.0-test2-pre2-for-2.2.16-v3.diff.gz
  2. Linux_Kernel_2.2.17

This document assumes a working knowledge of kernel and program compiling. If
unfamiliar with the process please go and read the Kernel-HOWTO.
Applying the patch:


  bash# cp usb-2.4.0-test2-pre2-for-2.2.16-v3.diff.gz /usr/src
  bash# gunzip /usr/src/usb-2.4.0-test2-pre2-for-2.2.16-v3.diff.gz
  bash# cd /usr/src/linux
  bash# patch -p1 < ../usb-2.4.0-test2-pre2-for-2.2.16-v3.diff


Select the following to be built as either modules or part of your kernel:

  1. Support for your USB controller (It is suggested that all of these be
     compiled as modules unless the controller type is known.).
  2. USB Kodak DC-2xx Camera Support.
  3. Preliminary USB Device Filesystem.

Reboot the system and then load the created modules if the support is not
compiled into the kernel. To load the modules do the following:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/usbcore.o


Use the following if the USB controller uses either an Intel or a VIA chipset.
Some others may also be supported:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/usb-uhci.o


Use the following if the above did not work and this is the controller type:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/uhci.o


Use this if the USB controller uses an SiS chipset, is a Compaq, or because the
above two didn't seem to work and this is the only option left to try.


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/usb-ohci-hcd.o


Load the module for Kodak Digital Camera support:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/dc2xx.o


Mount the USB Device Filesystem:


  bash# mount -t usbdevfs ignored /proc/bus/usb


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.3. 2.4.x Kernel USB Support

This section only applies to those running a 2.4.x series kernel. For those
running a 2.2.x series kernel skip this section and follow the 2.2.x Kernel USB
Support section. The 2.4.x series kernels have USB supported natively which
makes it a bit easier to configure than for the 2.2.x kernel series.
What software is needed (if not already present):

  1. Linux_Kernel_2.4.0

This document assumes a working knowledge of kernel and program compiling. If
unfamiliar with the process please go and read the Kernel-HOWTO.
Select the following to be built as either modules or part of your kernel:

  1. Support for your USB controller (It is suggested that all of these be
     compiled as modules unless the controller type is known.).
  2. USB Kodak DC-2xx Camera Support.
  3. Preliminary USB Device Filesystem.

Reboot the system and then load the created modules if the support is not
compiled into the kernel. To load the modules do the following:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/usbcore.o


Use the following if the USB controller uses either an Intel or a VIA chipset.
Some others may also be supported:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/usb-uhci.o


Use the following if the above did not work and this is the controller type:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/uhci.o


Use this if the USB controller uses an SiS chipset, is a Compaq, or because the
above two didn't seem to work and this is the only option left to try.


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/usb-ohci-hcd.o


Load the module for Kodak Digital Camera support:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usb/dc2xx.o


Mount the USB Device Filesystem:


  bash# mount -t usbdevfs ignored /proc/bus/usb


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.4. Kernel USB Devices

The following is a bash shell script designed to create all 16 Kodak devices
for use with both the current 2.4.x kernel series and the obsoleted 2.2.X
kernel series with the current USB backport. Copy the text below into a file
named MakeKodakDev, then make that file executable by typing 'chmod +x
MakeKodakDev' and then run the script ./MakeKodakDev as root (or su'd to root)
it will create the devices so they don't have to be made individually by hand.
It creates as per the dc2xx.txt file in the kernel documentation the following
16 devices:
/dev/dc2xx0 type=character major=180 minor=80
...
/dev/dc2xx16 type=character major=180 minor=95


  # Filename: MakeKodakDev
  # Creates the device files for USB access of Kodak digital cameras.
  # Last Modified January 6, 2001
  # Please see the Kodak Digital Camera HOWTO for more information
  # http://www.marblehorse.org/projects/documentation/kodak/
  #!/bin/sh

  export scrapvar=0

     while [ $scrapvar -lt 17 ];
        do mknod -m 0666 /dev/dc2xx$scrapvar c 180 $(( $scrapvar + 80 ));
        scrapvar=$(( $scrapvar + 1 ));
     done

  # EOF


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.5. Kernel IrDA Support

Most newer distributions come with IrDA support and the proper utilities to
handle IrDA. Redhat 7.0 is one of them. However for the rest of us some
configuration will be necessary. Get a copy of the latest kernel (2.2.x series
or above) and compile all the IrDA features in as modules. IrDA works a lot
like PCMCIA support in GNU/Linux so it is important to have all the modules for
any other IrDA devices one may have. There is a good HOWTO on compiling a new
kernel, the Kernel-HOWTO. Please refer to it for questions regarding
configuring and compiling a new Linux kernel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.6. IrDA Utils Software

The next step in configuring IrDA support is installing the irda-utils package.
Unfortunately, at the time of the current version of this HOWTO, the author had
problems locating the source archive for the utilities so he took the one
Redhat uses to build their RPM for Redhat 7.0. Please note that root
permissions will be necesary to run the commands needed to install the software
but should not be necesary to access the camera.
What software is needed (if not present already):

  1. irda-utils_0.9.10_and_patches
  2. gpg_signature_for_the_irda-utils_archive

Extracting the archive, patching, compiling and installing it:


  bash# cp irda-utils-0.9.10+patches.tar.gz /usr/src
  bash# cd /usr/src
  bash# tar zxvf irda-utils-0.9.10+patches.tar.gz
  bash# tar zxvf irda-utils-0.9.10.tar.gz
  bash# cd irda-utils-0.9.10
  bash# patch -p1 < ../irda-utils-0.9.4-chkconfig.patch
  bash# patch -p1 < ../irda-utils-typo.patch
  bash# patch -p1 < ../irda-utils-redhat.patch
  bash# make
  bash# make install


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.7. Creating the IrDA Device Nodes

The device nodes are necesary so that the application can talk to the driver
for the device. Although the irlpt devices are not necesary to get the camera
working, creating them now will save the time of having to look them up how to
do it later if you do ever need them.


  bash# mknod -m 0666 /dev/ircomm0 c 161 0
  bash# mknod -m 0666 /dev/ircomm1 c 161 1
  bash# mknod -m 0666 /dev/irlpt0 c 161 16
  bash# mknod -m 0666 /dev/irlpt1 c 161 17


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.8. Modifying /etc/conf.modules or /etc/modules.conf

Use a text editor and open up /etc/conf.modules or /etc/modules.conf depending
on your distribution. Add the following three lines to the file while being
careful not to change any others.


  #IrDA
  alias tty-ldisc-11 irtty
  alias char-major-161 ircomm-tty


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.9. Enabling IrDA and Testing for Connectivity

Irmanager is what starts and stops the proper IrDA modules. The d1 flag tells
irmanager to enter discovery mode.
As user root run the following command:


  bash# /usr/sbin/irmanager -d1


Put the camera into connect mode and turn it on. Make sure that the camera is
close to and facing the IrDA port on the computer. Run the following to see if
there are any communications via IrDA:


  bash$ /usr/bin/irdadump


After running the command one should see output similar to the following:


  00:04:10.608823 xid:cmd bedcb551 > ffffffff S=6 s=2 (14)
  00:04:10.698818 xid:cmd bedcb551 > ffffffff S=6 s=3 (14)
  00:04:10.788815 xid:rsp bedcb551 < 5f36a4a1 S=6 s=3 Kodak DC265 Zoom

  00:04:10.978818 xid:cmd bedcb551 > ffffffff S=6 s=* armstrong hint=0400
  [ Computer ] (25)

  6 packets received by filter


If the previous message was not displayed, try relocating the camera closer or
further away from the IrDA port and ensure that there is not too much external
interference in the environment in the form of light. Also if the machine is a
laptop with a PC-Card (or PCMCIA) modem removing it may help resolve the issue.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4. Compact Flash PC Card Adapter/PCMCIA-ATA Storage Card

This section is for those who wish to utilize maximum data transfer rate and
save the battery power in the camera's batteries. The method of connectivity
suggested in this section applies to all Kodak DC-Series cameras that use
either PCMCIA-ATA storage cards or Compact Flash Cards. This method of picture
access only allows for storage, retrieval, and deletion of images on a Compact
Flash Card. These instructions are tested with a Kodak 16 MB Picture Card and a
SanDisk CompactFlash PC Card Adapter on a Dell Inspiron 7000 notebook computer.
What software is needed (if not already present):

  1. PCMCIA-CS-3.1.21

This document assumes a working knowledge of kernel and program compiling. If
unfamiliar with the process it is strongly suggested to go and read the Kernel-
HOWTO.
Select the following to be built as either modules or part of your kernel:

  1. DOS FAT fs support
  2. VFAT (Windows-95) fs support

Reboot the system and then load the created modules each time access to the
compact flash card is desired if the support is not compiled into the kernel.
To load the modules do the following:


  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/fat.o
  bash# /sbin/insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/vfat.o


Compile and configure PCMCIA-CS. This part of the process is beyond the scope
of this document, however there is a document with such information that can be
found in the PCMCIA-HOWTO. There is also most likely a pre-packaged version for
the distribution of GNU/Linux the computer running. This step can be greatly
simplified if a pre-packaged version is used.
Using the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter:
Create a directory to mount the Compact Flash Card to.


  bash# mkdir /flashcard


Insert the Compact Flash Card into the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter (both
should face the same direction. Note that this step is unnecessary for the
cameras that use a PCMCIA-ATA storage card.).
Insert the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter or PCMCIA-ATA storage card into the
PC-Card slot of the notebook computer.
Mount the card to /flashcard (The Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter/PCMCIA-ATA
storage card is assigned its device by figuring out how many IDE controllers
are on the system, and then assigning it the next device. For example, if a
system were to have 2 IDE controllers, and would thus have /dev/hda /dev/hdb /
dev/hdc and /dev/hdd assigned to the current controllers, the Compact Flash
Card PC Card Adapter would be assigned /dev/hde1.).


  bash# mount -t vfat /dev/hde1 /flashcard


From this point the files can be copied, moved, deleted, and renamed as done on
a normal filesystem. Information regarding file management commands may be
found in the documentation included with the OS distribution used, such as man
pages. The manual pages which list the commands to use to do the above
procedures can be accesses by typing the following to get the command's
respective manual page entry: 'man cp', 'man mv', 'man rm'. Before removing the
Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter remember to unmount it with the following
command.


  bash# umount /flashcard


The Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter/PCMCIA-ATA storage card can be removed
from the PC Card Reader and the Compact Flash Card and be removed from the
Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter (If the adapter was used).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Software Support


4.1. OpenDiS (Open Digita Services)

OpenDiS_Web_Site
OpenDiS contains a user-level program and an access library for using DigitaOS
enabled cameras. Currently those cameras would be the Kodak DC220, DC260,
DC265, DC290 and HP Photosmart C500 and the Minolta EX1500. Although the Kodak
digital camera series works best with this application the others have been
found to work with the application also. This program has a CLI (command line
interface) which is very useful for scripting tasks.
What is needed: OpenDiS_0.0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.1. Compiling, extracting and installing OpenDiS

Run the following commands to compile, extract and install OpenDiS


  bash$ tar -zxvf opendis-0.0.3.tar.gz
  bash$ cd opendis-0.0.3
  bash$ ./configure
  bash$ make
  bash# make install


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.2. Usage

The following usage section is taken directly from the output of the ks
command.
¬†¬†¬†¬†Usage:¬†ks¬†[OPTION]...¬†[COMMAND]...
¬†¬†¬†


  Connect to camera and perform COMMANDs.
  Updated: 0.0.3
  Development note: currently some COMMANDs are supported; default
  action is to display this help.  However, all listed
  OPTIONS are now supported.

  -d DEV, --device=DEV       Look for camera at device DEV.  Defaults
                              to /dev/ttyS0.
   -r RATE, --rate=RATE       Use bit-rate RATE for serial device.  Defaults
                              to 9600.  Not applicable to USB or IrDA.
   -t TYPE, --type=TYPE       Specifies device type, one of: "serial"
                              "usb", or "irda".  Normally, device type
                              can be deduced from DEV and need not be
                              specified
   -i, --irda                 Same as --type=irda
   -s, --serial               Same as --type=serial
   -u, --usb                  Same as --type=usb

   -v  --verbose              More output.
   -q  --quiet                Less output.

   -l, --list                 List supported commands
   -h, --help                 Display this help and exit.

  Currently following commands are supported:

    delall        Delete all files in the camera
    download      Download pictures
    thumbs        Download thumbnails
    gettime       Get camera's date/time
    settime       Set camera clock according to computer's clock
    shoot         Take a picture
    status        Show pictures taken, available and raw count
    getpowermode  Checks if camera is on
    poweroff      Turn the camera off


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.3. Usage Examples

USB:
Special USB notes. The USB stack has been ever changing in the developmental
kernels and as such works differently from time to time. In playing with the
latest developmental kernel released the camera tends to show up on /dev/dc2xx0
or /dev/dc2xx1, independent of the fact that only one camera is connected. The
support for these devices is all fairly new, so expect to have to play with it
to get it working. The following should allow one to download all images from
the camera to the working directory with a USB connection. Make sure that the
camera is in connect mode.


  bash$ ks -d /dev/dc2xx0 download


Serial:
Serial support does work and as such the following command should allow one to
download all images from the camera into their current working directory.
Modify the serial port device name as necessary. Ensure that the camera is on
and in connect mode and that the serial cable is connected between the
computer's serial port and the camera.


  bash$ ks -d /dev/ttyS0 download


IrDA:
IrDA is not supported in the release version of OpenDiS, however support has
been added to the CVS version. To obtain the latest version of OpenDiS via CVS
run the following (hit the enter key at the password prompt, there is no
password):


  bash$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ods.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ods login
  bash$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ods.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ods checkout
  bash# bash$ ods/opendis-current


To compile and configure this version do the following:


  bash$ cd ods
  bash$ cd opendis-current
  bash$ ./configure
  bash$ make
  bash# make install


An example command which will download all the images from the camera via IrDA
would look as follows. Remember to have the camera on and in connect mode. It
may also be advisable to increase the auto-shutoff feature to a larger value (5
minutes if possible).


  bash$ ks -d /dev/ircomm0 download


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2. Digita Operating Environment- Command Device Protocol Python Script

This Python script written by Sai Lai Lo of AT&T Cambridge Laboratories allows
for download
of images from Kodak Digital Cameras running DigitaOS (DC220, DC260, DC265 and
DC290) and using USB for transfer. Some have problems with this script and some
don't. However it is nice to cover all bases.
Here a working copy of the Command_Device_Protocol_Python_Script can be
attained. The original Command_Device_Protocol_Python_Script for which the one
above is derived has to be edited to remove leading text to work.
The script depends on /dev/kodak existing due to the way older kernels accessed
the Kodak Digital Camera USB Device. A symbolic link must be created between
the actual device the camera is on and /dev/kodak. If the camera is on /dev/
dc2xx0 the symbolic link needed can be created with the following command:


  bash# ln -s /dev/dc2xx0 /dev/kodak


Be sure to substitute in the proper device name instead of dc2xx0 if the camera
was not assigned dc2xx0. To list all files on the camera run the following
command:


  bash$ python cdp.py


To download a single image from the camera run the following command, remember
to modify the command accordingly for your specific camera:


  bash$ python cdp.py 2:DC265_01/P0000748.JPG


That command will download the image P0000748.JPG to the directory DC265_01 in
the current directory. A quick and easy command to download all the images from
the camera would be:


  bash$ for file in $(python cdp.py); do python cdp.py $file; done


This is just a few of the many ways such a script can work. It is possible to
use the above command in a larger shell script to automate downloading the
images from the camera, converting the images to another format, resizing the
images, creating a web page automatically, and many many others. The options
are endless when it comes to scripts like this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. gPhoto

gPhoto_Web_Site
Still deciding the best way to implement this section. Possibly a DocBook
manual for gPhoto needs to be written but according to the gPhoto project web
site a manual is being developed at the moment. Contact with the developers of
gPhoto has been made and a decision to work on the document at some point,
presuming someone else doesn't do it earlier, has been made. However the
document processing program used to create this HOWTO, LyX, does not support
all the necessary SGML tags and thus that will become an intermediate project
before a manual for gPhoto.
A manual is available for gPhoto with its source code and may also be
distributed with the various package offerings available with gPhoto binary
distributions. The filename is MANUAL and it is located in the root of the
extracted tar archive. The file INSTALL details the process of compiling and
installing gPhoto if a binary package is not available for a particular
distribution.
gPhoto supports serial image transfer from the Kodak DC20, DC25, DC200+, DC210,
DC210+ Zoom, DC215 Zoom, DC220, DC220+, DC240, DC260, DC265, DC280 and DC290
with it's 0.4.3 release. With the CVS version of the software USB support is
added for the DC220, DC260, DC265 and the DC280. gPhoto tends to be the
preferred application of most digital camera users under GNU/Linux and is
distributed with Helix_GNOME.

specifically oriented towards the Kodak DC215 camera.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2. Other Useful Mailing Lists


5.2.1. Linux-USB

Linux-USB
The Linux-USB mailing list is a very active mailing list pertaining to all
aspects of USB and Linux. Here one will find the most recent patches for the
USB code in the Linux kernel. There is also good discussion on support of
digital cameras from time to time. Overall a great list to peek at every week
or so.
To subscribe to this list send a blank email to linux-usb-subscribe@suse.com. A
confirmation email that must be replied to will then be sent back. Either send
a reply to the email address in the reply-to: section of the email, or the
address listed in the confirmation message itself. To unsubscribe from the list
send a blank email to linux-usb-unsubscribe@suse.com. This action will then
have to be confirmed with the same method used for confirming subscription to
the mailing list. For a list of other useful commands send an email to linux-
usb-info@suse.com.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2.2. Linux-kernel

Linux-kernel
The linux-kernel mailing list is a very high traffic mailing list detailing all
aspects of the Linux kernel. This list is only for those who wish to have more
information than the Linux-USB list and the gPhoto-Kodak lists contain.
However, it covers much more of a broad spectrum of topics than Kodak digital
camera support under Linux.
Before posting or subscribing to the Linux-kernel mailing list is highly
suggested reading the Linux-kernel_mailing_list_FAQ. It could save much time
and embarrassment. It also contains useful information on who certain
individuals are in the Linux community in relation to their standing on the
list.
To subscribe to the list (remember, it is about 200 emails a day) send an email
to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with "subscribe linux-kernel username@mailserver"
in the body of the message where username is the email account to be used and
mailserver is the name of the mail server. Remember to omit the quotation
marks.
An alternative to joining the list would be to get the list in digest format.
This is a better format to many as it is a few emails a day rather than several
hundred. One drawback of this is that it is not as easy to discuss the issues
with the mailing list as most mail clients don't know how to deal with the
digest in its format besides dealing with it like plain text. To subscribe to
the digest send an email to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the line "subscribe
linux-kernel-digest username@mailserver" in the body of the message. Where
username is the email account username to be used and mailserver is the name of
the mail server. Remember to omit the quotation marks.
Unsubscribing from the mail list is as easy as subscribing. Just send an email
to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in the
body of the message, or alternately "unsubscribe linux-kernel-digest" if
subscribed to the digest. And again, remember to omit the quotation marks.
Rather than subscribing to this list it would be highly suggested to search
through the archive which is accessible via the URL listed above. Another
alternative is the Kernel_Trafficsite. It contains a good overview of the weeks
kernel developmental works and discussions in a summary format.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2.3. gPhoto-Kodak

gPhoto-Kodak
This list contains much information regarding gPhoto and Kodak cameras. It also
contains much discussion on the OpenDiS project and their releases. The latest
version of OpenDiS is usually announced on this mailing list and allows one to
try out the new functions. Instructions and the form to join the mailing list
are at the following URL: http://lists.styx.net/mailman/listinfo/gphoto-kodak/.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3. Useful Web Sites / Other Resources


5.3.1. Linux-USB Project

Linux_USB_Project
The Linux-USB Project's web page contains much information pertaining to Linux
and USB in general. Although not all information is pertinent to this HOWTO, a
large portion of it is. It contains links to the latest USB support, driver
maintainers and device working status. Take a look here and in the Linux-USB
mail archive if having a problem getting USB working. Chances are one of the
later developmental kernels or the source on the CVS will solve the issue.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3.2. Linux USB for DC-2xx Cameras

Linux_USB_for_DC-2xx_Cameras
This website is maintained by David Brownell, author of the Kodak DC-2xx kernel
support. It contains some information not included in this HOWTO as of yet and
holds the latest information regarding configuring USB support. Look here for
new developments in supporting the Kodak DC-2xx camera series.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3.3. OpenDiS (Open Digita Services)

OpenDiS_(Open_Digita_Services)
The Open Digita Services web site is the main source of information on the
support of cameras running Digita which include the Kodak DC-220, DC-260, DC-
265, DC-290, the Minolta EX-1500 and the HP PhotoSmart C500.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3.4. gPhoto

gPhoto
gPhoto is free software for digital cameras licensed under the GNU GPL. It
currently supports more than 90 camera models from various vendors. gPhoto has
a command line and a GTK+ graphical interface. Many people swear by this
program. Installation, configuration and usage information will be added.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3.5. kdcpi

kdpci
kdcpi is a program that the latest developer release supports the Kodak DC200,
DC210, DC40, DC50 and DC120. This program has both a CLI (command line
interface) and a GUI (graphical user interface). Information regarding
installation, configuration and usage information will be added.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3.6. Digital Photography Review

Digital_Photography_Review
Trying to decide which digital camera is best? Digital Photography Review is
the most comprehensive website available for all anyone wants to know about
digital cameras. This site is not limited to just the Kodak product line and
offers great reviews of the newest and older digital cameras. Take a look
through the online photo gallery with detailed information pertaining to the
camera used and its setting for each and every photograph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. FAQ

Q: Why aren't there any entries but this one in the FAQ?
A: Because the HOWTO is currently is a non-public release state and thus there
was no time for anyone to ask any questions! So email your questions off to
David Burley <khemicals@marblehorse.org> and lets add to it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. TODO

The following TODO list is nowhere near complete. It is simply a list of things
meant to added in the future that others have suggested. If anyone has any
suggestions for new entries into the HOWTO please email them to David_Burley.

  1. Interesting digital camera uses (aerial/under water photography among
     others).
  2. Additional support of more Kodak digital cameras (gPhoto support with
     those).
  3. Support for non-Kodak digital cameras (most likely not anytime in the near
     future. this is out of the scope of the current document.).
  4. Additional camera interfacing methods.
  5. Updating Firmware (current format for firmware is an Install Shield
     file.... useless under GNU/Linux).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
