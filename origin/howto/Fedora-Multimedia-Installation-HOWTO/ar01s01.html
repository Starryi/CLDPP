playing MP3 files, playing Quicktime/AVI/RealMedia/Windows Media streams,
and playing encrypted DVDs that the Fedora distro folks won't tell you how
to do, either because they're afraid of being sued under the DMCA or for
various other esthetic and political reasons.</p><p>This HOWTO collects the relevant information in one place. It is not
a general multimedia-on-Linux HOWTO; if it were, there are hundreds of
nifty tools and packages it would list (starting with the GIMP and all its
kindred and forks and symbiotes).  The packages we'll cover here are just the
legal and political hot potatoes, the stuff that threatens monopolies and
worries lawyers.</p><p>Good background information on souping up your Fedora system can also
be found at the <a class="ulink" href="http://fedoranews.org/" target="_top">FedoraNEWS</a>
website and the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fedorafaq.org/" target="_top">Unofficial Fedora
FAQ</a>.  One assumption that distinguishes this document from these
other sources is that you are as lazy as I am &#8212; you want to install
your Damned Things (and, later, update them) with your normal
package-management toolswith an absolute minimum of going to special sites,
download source tarballs, or executing unique build procedures.</p><p>Legal note: No source code or locations of source code of any
software alleged to be covered by the DMCA is disclosed on this page, you
will have to look on my personal website for that. The DMCA is a bad law
rammed down our throats by fools and villains and the use of it to
suppress free speech about software is a disgrace, but in order to ensure that
this HOWTO gets maximum distribution I have remained in compliance with it
here.</p><p>One reason I am doing this is that I believe I'm a harder target for
the attack lawyers than most hackers; public fame and a reputation for
truth-telling are helpful here.  If you are an attack lawyer, be warned
that I invariably respond to attempts at intimidation by fighting back,
that I am legally savvy and <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> good at working the
press, and that I <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> exert all my considerable
ability to make your and your client's name a public disgrace if you try to
suppress my speech.  You have been warned.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="newversions"></a>1.1. New versions of this document</h3></div></div></div><p>You can also view the latest version of this HOWTO on the World Wide
