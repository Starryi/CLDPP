<EM>1.How to turn inexpensive legacy computers into fast terminals using the power
of your main computer, you will need : A fast computer to act as Server, A
client computer (old and unwanted). Linux compatible network cards. A
connection between computers.
2.How to centralise system administaration by useing NFS, ie placing the
entire file system of a faster client on the server.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="What"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Linux allows any reasonably new computer to be used as a server to a
thin client, or many thin clients, these thin clients can be inexpensive
legacy computers. For a console terminal you need a 386 with 4-8mb of ram, or
for an X-Terminal a 486/66 with 8-16mb ram.
</LI>
<LI>One Option is without a hard drive, it keeps the noise down and
simplifies administration as you only have one system to maintain.
</LI>
<LI>If you have legacy apps, you can have them on a hard drive with it's
legacy Operating System
</LI>
<LI>This howto is aimed at those new to Unix/Linux, it will cover the
essential areas you need to be aware of and point you to other documentation
in that area you need to be familiar with.
</LI>
<LI>You will probably use this as an aid to the
<A HREF="http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/">http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/</A>  documentation, I include some more
examples of config files, and leave many of the other features of etherboot as
an exercise for the reader
</LI>
<LI>If your client is sufficiently powerful only the file system need be
shared, applications can run on the client system. (say a 233 32mb ram).
Install an application on the server and all clients have access
</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Hardware</A>
</H2>

<P>When you start, you will need at least this</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>a computer to act as Server,</LI>
<LI>a client computer, I unplugged the power to the hard disk
and disabled the drive in the bios to emulate a diskless machine</LI>
<LI>compatible network cards</LI>
<LI>connection between computers, I used twisted pair ethernet with RJ45
terminators
<UL>
<LI>For two computers a <I>cross-over cable </I> is sufficient, and
saves another power point, the first computer shop I went to gave me blank
stares, idiots !</LI>
<LI>For two or more clients, you need a hub, a kit with a 10 mb
4 port hub ,2 cards sells for under A$150, you can probably do better,
I've had some success with $5 second hand cards, 3m cables for $6, a new
hub for $40, a found monitor and a $60 pentium 75</LI>
</UL>

<P>trivial ftp - after you have your IP number your client requests a kernal,
this is delivered over ethernet.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Kernel image</A>

<P>You must compile a kernel for the Client that includes NFS support and the NIC
driver for that client compiled in (not modules).  Answer yes to
<EM>Root file system on NFS?</EM> and <EM>BOOTP support?</EM></P>
<P>After building the kernel, run mknbi-linux from the Etherboot distribution
on it.(the mknbi program in the netboot/linux directory) Install this tagged
image as /tftpdir/"vmlinuz.xterm".</P>

</H2>

<P>It's easiest to allow anybody and anything to run services
and process on your computer, but one day you will be sorry. You restrict
these by your /etc/hosts.deny and specifically restore rights by
/etc/hosts.allow, indicative examples :
<HR>
<PRE>
#hosts.deny
# all except those in hosts.allow

#hosts.allow
#only hosts within my domain and my host at home.

</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>more security - look for more information in the ldp-howto's and if your
using etherboot, in it's security howto.</P>

<H2><A NAME="client"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Client setup</A></H2>

<P><EM>Network loader</EM></P>
<P>A small program that runs as a BIOS extension, can be loaded from a floppy,
or you can burn an eprom chip and insert it on your network card for a totally
diskless client. It handles the DHCPD query and TFTP loading and then
transfers control to the loaded image. It uses TCP/IP protocols.</P>

<P>There are two free implementations of TCP/IP net loaders: 
<A HREF="http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/">Etherboot</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.han.de/~gero/netboot.html">Netboot</A>: Etherboot
uses built-in drivers while Netboot uses Packet drivers.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>see etherboot-4.2/doc/html/README-2.html,</LI>
<LI>I compiled the option to ask local or Network and default to local after
5 seconds</LI>
<LI>making a boot rom floppy, floppyload.bin was tricky to find, I copied it
into the directory of compiled rom images
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="NFS"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Network files system</A></H2>


<P>The Client requests to mount <CODE>/tftpboot/</CODE><I>&lt;IP address of
client></I> as its <CODE>/</CODE> by NFS from server. You must export this from
the server,(maybe symlink to /tftpboot/<CODE><I>client</I></CODE> to be safe.)</P>
<P><EM>NFS</EM> is a big topic there is a HOWTO and two mini Howto's.</P>
<P>first you need to create a copy of your current system under /tftpboot
ken has written two scripts that do all your work, I called them makefirst and
makecopy. my first client takes 20-30mb and the copy less. I used du -h to look
for large unnecesary files.</P>
