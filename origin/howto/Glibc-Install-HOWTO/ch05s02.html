in this case you can only use the command <span class="command"><strong>cd</strong></span>,
but nothing else. This is the reason why in this HOWTO I have described
in detail how to make those tools static.</p><p>The only tool not static is <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span> and, for good 
reason in my opinion, it is included in the package of
linux-utils, which also contains <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span>, 
<span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span>, etc.  Since you are
not able to use statically-linked versions in combination with PAM or
other security-related software, it would be unwise to
compile them statically under all circumstances. Of course you are free to do so if you are really sure about what you are doing.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="going-back-to-a-working-configuration"></a>2.1. Going back to a working configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>The way back to a working configuration is quite simple if you
have the static tools:  go to the directory 
<code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/</code>
and move all the newly installed files into another location (eg.
<code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/storedaway</code>). You may identify them by
looking at their version number, which should be the same as the one from
your glibc installation (in my example all files fitted to
the scheme lib*-2.2.4), and of course by the creation date and
time. It is quite uncommon that two different libraries have the
same version number at the same time&#8212;I, myself, have never
experienced such a thing&#8212;but just to be sure you do not delete
something important to your system, check the date and
time of creation. A very useful tool in this case is the Midnight
Commander, if you have it installed.</p><p>You could try to remove the files <code class="filename">ld-2.2.4.so</code> and
<code class="filename">libc-2.2.4.so</code> and run <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig -v</strong></span> afterwards, before
removing all the crashed files.  This will enable you to use at
least most of your programs and in every case you will be able
to run the Midnight Commander.</p><p>Do not forget to do at least one <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig -v</strong></span> after you have removed all the files.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="removing-the-causes-for-the-crashing-of-the-installation"></a>2.1.1. Removing the causes for the crashing of the installation</h4></div></div></div><p>A common cause for problems is that your distribution has stored
all the library files in a different location than the newly-installed
routine will use, thus it often happens that there are two
versions running simultaneously, disturbing each other. In my case,
lots of trouble was caused by a second copy of <code class="filename">libc6.so</code> 
lying around in <code class="filename">/lib</code>, a symbolic link from this file to
the corresponding one in <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib</code> fixes this problem.
