nothing more annoying than having program behaviour and
documentation disagree. Users will curse you, send you hate mail
and throw your work into the bit bucket, with the firm intent to
never install anything written by that jerk again.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The historical and well known way documentation is accessed
on UNIX is via the man(1) command. This HOWTO describes what you
have to do to write a man page that will be correctly processed by
the documentation- related tools. The most important of these tools
are <TT

>You need to know the precise mechanism for acccessing man
pages in order to give your man page the right name and install it
in the right place. Each man page should be categorized in a
specific section, denoted by a single character. The most common
sections under Linux, and their human readable names, are:</P

   1    User commands that may be started by everyone.
   2    System calls, that is, functions provided by the kernel.
   3    Subroutines, that is, library functions.
   4    Devices, that is, special files in the /dev directory.
   5    File format descriptions, e.g. /etc/passwd.
   6    Games, self-explanatory.
   7    Miscellaneous, e.g. macro packages, conventions.

   n    (Deprecated) New documentation, that may be moved to a more appropriate section.

   l    (Deprecated) Local documentation referring to this particular system.</PRE

><P
>The name of the man page's source file (the input to the
formatting system) is the name of the command, function or file
name, followed by a dot, followed by the section character. If you
write the documentation on the format of the `passwd' file you
have to name the source file `passwd.5'. Here we also have an
example of a file name that is the same as a command name. There
might be even a library subroutine named passwd. Sectioning is the
usual way to resolve these ambiguities: The command description is
found in the file `passwd.1' and the hypothetical library
subroutine in `passwd.3'.</P
><P
>Sometimes additional characters are appended and the file
name looks for example like `xterm.1x' or `wish.1tk'. The
intent is to indicate that this is documentation for an X Window
program or a Tk application, respectively. Some manual browsers can
make use of this additional information. For example xman will use
`xterm(x)' and `wish(tk)' in the list of available
documentation.</P
><P
>Please don't use the n, o and l sections; according to
the File System Standard these sections are deprecated. Stick to
the numeric sections. Beware of name clashes with existing
programs, functions or file names. It is certainly a bad idea to
write yet another editor and call it ed, sed (for smart ed) or red
(for Rocky's ed). By making sure your program's name is
unique, you avoid having someone execute your program but read
someone else's man page, or vice versa.</P
><P
>Now we know the name to give our file. The next decision is
the directory in which it will finally be installed (say, when the
user runs `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make install</TT
>' for your package.)
On Linux, all man pages are below directories listed in the
environment variable MANPATH. The doc-related tools use MANPATH in
the same way the shell uses PATH to locate executables. In fact,
MANPATH has the same format as PATH. Each contains a
colon-separated list of directories (with the exception that
MANPATH does not allow empty fields and relative pathnames -- it
uses absolute names only.) If MANPATH is not set or not exported, a
default will be used that contains at least the /usr/man directory.
To speed up the search and to keep directories small, the
directories specified by MANPATH (the so-called base directories)
contain a bunch of subdirectories named `man&#60;s&#62;' where
&#60;s&#62; stands for the one-character section designator
introduced in the <A
HREF="#Q2"
>table above</A
>. Not all of
the sections may be represented by a subdirectory because there
simply is no reason to keep an empty `mano' subdirectory.
However, there may be directories named `cat&#60;s&#62;',
`dvi&#60;s&#62;' and `ps&#60;s&#62;' which hold documentation
that is ready to display or print. More on this later. The only
other file in any base directory should be a file named
`whatis'. The purpose and creation of this file will also be
described under <A
HREF="#Q12"
>paragraph 12)</A
>. The
safest way to have a man page for section &#60;s&#62; installed in
the right place is to put it in the directory
/usr/man/man&#60;s&#62;. A good <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Makefile</TT
>, however,
will allow the user to chose a base directory, by means of a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make</TT
> variable, MANDIR, say. Most of the GNU
packages can be configured with the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--prefix=/what/ever</TT
> option. The manuals will
then be installed under the base directory /what/ever/man. I
suggest you also provide a way to do something similar.</P
><P
>With the advent of the Linux
File System Standard (FS-Stnd), things became more
complicated. [Note: the FS-Stnd appears to be replaced
by the <A
HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"
TARGET="_top"
>Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</A
>, FHS.] The FS-Stnd 1.2 states that</P
><P
>"Provisions must be made in the structure of /usr/man to
support manual pages which are written in different (or multiple)
languages."</P
><P
>This is achieved by introducing another directory level that
distinguishes between different languages. Quoting again from
FS-Stnd 1.2:</P
><P
>"This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/man is
based on Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes
the locale identification string -- the most well accepted method
to describe a cultural environment. The &#60;locale&#62; string is:
&#60;language&#62;[_&#60;territory&#62;][.&#60;character-set&#62;][,&#60;version&#62;]"</P
><P
>(See the FS-Stnd for a few common &#60;locale&#62; strings.)
According to these guidelines, we have our man pages in
/usr/man/&#60;locale&#62;/man[1-9lno]. The formatted versions should
then be in /usr/man/&#60;locale&#62;/cat[1-9lno] of course, otherwise
we could only provide them for a single locale. HOWEVER, I can not
recommend switching to that structure at this time. The FS-Stnd 1.2
also allows that</P
><P
>"Systems which use a unique language and code set for
all manual pages may omit the &#60;locale&#62; substring and store
all manual pages in &#60;mandir&#62;. For example, systems which only
have English manual pages coded with ASCII, may store manual pages
(the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>man[1-9]</TT
> directories) directly in /usr/man.
(That is the traditional circumstance and arrangement in
fact.)"</P
><P
>I would not switch until all tools (like xman, tkman, info
and many others that read man pages) can cope with the new
structure.</P

NAME
    foo - frobnicate the bar library

SYNOPSIS
    foo [-bar] [-c config-file ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     foo  frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol
     tables. By default it parses all baz segments and rearranges
     them  in  reverse  order  by time for the xyzzy(1) linker to
     find them. The symdef entry is then compressed using the WBG
     (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm.  All files are processed in the
     order specified.

OPTIONS
     -b   Do not write `busy' to stdout while processing.

     -c config-file
          Use the alternate system wide  config-file  instead  of
          /etc/foo.conf.   This overrides any FOOCONF environment
          variable.

     -a   In addition to the baz segments, also parse the  blurfl
          headers.

     -r   Recursive  mode.  Operates  as fast as lightning at the
          expense of a megabyte of virtual memory.

FILES
     /etc/foo.conf
          The system wide configuration file. See foo(5) for fur-
          ther details.
     ~/.foorc
          Per  user  configuration  file.  See foo(5) for further
          details.

ENVIRONMENT
     FOOCONF
          If non-null the full pathname for an  alternate  system
          wide foo.conf.  Overridden by the -c option.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

     Bad magic number.
          The input file does not look like an archive file.
     Old style baz segments.
          foo  can  only  handle  new  style  baz segments. COBOL
          object libraries are not supported in this version.

BUGS
     The command name should have been chosen more  carefully  to
     reflect its purpose.

other sections if they really don't fit in one of those

slight drawback: if flexibility is a concern, you have to be aware
that there are file systems that do not support symbolic links. The
upshot of this is that the Best Thing (TM) is using
<TT

do it: If you want to have your man page available under the names
`foo' and `bar' in section 1, then put the man page in
foo.1 and have bar.1 look like this:</P

blank between `<TT

>groff
-man</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.an</TT
> macro package. That's the reason for
the strange name `tmac.an'. Besides tmac.an there is another
popular macro package, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.doc</TT
>, which
originated at the University of California at Berkeley. Many BSD
man pages use it and it seems that UCB has made it its standard for
documentation. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.doc</TT
> macros are much more
flexible but alas, there are manual browsers that will not use them
but always call <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>groff -man</TT
>. For example, all
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xman</TT
> programs I have seen will screw up on man
pages requiring <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.doc</TT
>. So do yourself a
favor: use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.an</TT
> -- use of any other macro
package is considered harmful. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.andoc</TT
> is a
pseudo macro package that takes a look at the source and then loads
either <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.an</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.doc</TT
>.
Actually, any man page browser should use it but to this point, not
all of them do, so it is best we cling to ye olde
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.an</TT
>. Anything I tell you from now on and
concerning macros only holds true for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tmac.an</TT
>.
If you want to use the <TT

>Groff comes with at least three preprocessors,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tbl</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>eqn</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pic</TT
> (on some systems they are named
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>geqn</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gpic</TT
>.) Their purpose is to translate
preprocessor macros and their data to regular troff input.
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Tbl</TT
> is a table preprocessor,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eqn</TT
> is an equations/maths preprocessor and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pic</TT
> is a picture preprocessor. Please refer to
the man pages for more information on what functionality they
provide. To put it in a nutshell: don't write man pages
requiring <EM
>any</EM
> preprocessor. Eqn will generally
produce terrible output for typewriter-like devices, unfortunately
the type of device 99% of all man pages are viewed on (well, at
least I do). For example, XAllocColor.3x uses a few formulas with
exponentiation. Due to the nature of typewriter-like devices, the
exponent will be on the same line as the base. N to the power of
two appears as `N2'. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Tbl</TT
> should be avoided
because all xman programs I have seen fail on them. Xman 3.1.6 uses
the following command to format man pages, e.g. signal(7):</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl /usr/man/man7/signal.7 | geqn | gtbl | groff
-Tascii -man /tmp/xmana01760 2&#62; /dev/null</TT
></P
><P
>which screws up for sources using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
>,
because <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
> output is fed again into
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
>. The effect is a man page without your
table. I don't know if it's a bug or a feature that
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
> chokes on its own output or if xman could
be a little smarter and not use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
> twice.
Furthermore, some systems use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>grog</TT
> to determine
what options to pass to groff. Unfortunately grog sometimes guesses
wrong and recommends <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>groff -t</TT

<TT

forgetting the font change at the end of the word and having the

happens more often than you think. The <TT

" "and Bold, " "and Italics."</P

argument; without them, no white space appears between the
alternating typefaces. In fact, you'll only need the macros for
alternating typefaces in cases where you <EM

to avoid white space between typeface changes. So much for
what's available. Here's how you should make use of the
