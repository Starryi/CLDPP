simulate and outage and see how the transition goes. Note that in general
testing an UPS by pulling the plug from the wall is not a good
idea. Electronics like to always have a good ground reference. If you
unplug a UPS, it's still powered but now has what electricians call a
"floating ground". Not only can this be bad for electronics, but it can be
quite dangerous as well. It is likely that unplugging just about any UPS
for a short amount of time isn't likely to result in disaster (don't take
our word for it, though!), but in all cases, throwing a circuit breaker
would be a better thing to do.</p><p>It might be useful to install a GFI (Ground Fault Interrupter) on your
UPS-covered outlets to facilitate this testing without having to throw a
breaker, especially if you don't have your UPS protected machines on an
isolated circuit (which you probably should). These are the sockets found
in most modern kitchens and bathrooms with a red and a black button. You
push the latter to cut power and the former to restore power.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3. UPS Basics </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5. Maintaining Your UPS</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
