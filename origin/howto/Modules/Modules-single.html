><P
>      My experience with Linux and modules has been that the existing
      documents fail to provide a satisfactory explanation as to how to
      successfully set up Linux with modules configured and working. The
      procedure explained in this document has been successfully used several
      times, both on my own system and over the Internet to give directions
      to somebody trying to get some feature to work which requires a driver
      supplied only in module form.
    </P
><P
>      My own system runs from a RedHat 4.1 distribution of Linux, and it was
      on this setup that I developed the procedure. I have since successfully
      installed it on systems running from various Slackware distributions, and
      on one system running from a Debian distribution, and the necessary
      procedure to correctly configure modules under Linux in all three is
      documented herein.

        inconsistent results on apparently identical systems. I have not yet
        determined what the problem is, so can make no guarantees at this stage
        as to whether or not it will work on your system.

>      If your machine has 16 or more Megabytes of RAM, there is a useful
      speed-up that can be done, which is to permit the kernel to compile two or
      modules in parallel. This will increase the load on the machine whilst the
      kernel is being recompiled, but will reduce the time during which the
      compilation will be taking place. 
    </P
><P
>      Before you can use this method, you need to check the amount of RAM
      present in your machine, as if you set this too high, the compilation will
      actually slow down. Experience has shown that the optimum value depends on
      the amount of RAM in your system according to the following formula, at
      least for systems with up to 32 Megabytes of RAM, although it may be a
      little conservative for systems with larger amounts of RAM: 
    </P
><P
>      N = [RAM in Megabytes] / 8 + 1

      common amounts of RAM are as follows:
