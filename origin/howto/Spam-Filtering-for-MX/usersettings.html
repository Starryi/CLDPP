      There are other situations where you may want to support
      settings and data for each user at site.  For instance, if you
      scan incoming mail with SpamAssassin (see <a class="xref" href="datachecks.html#spamscanners" title="6.7. Spam Scanners">Spam Scanners</a>), you may want to allow for individual
      spam thresholds, acceptable languages and character sets, and
      Bayesian training/data.
    </p><p>
      A sticking point is that SMTP-time filtering of incoming mail is
      done at the system level, before mail is being delivered to a
      particular user, and as such, does not lend itself too well to
      individual preferences.  A single message may have several
      recipients; and unlike the case with <a class="xref" href="forwardedmail.html" title="3. Forwarded Mail">Forwarded Mail</a>, using an aggregate of each
      recipient's preferences is not a good option.  Consider a
      scenario where you have users from different linguistic
      backgrounds.
    </p><p>
      As it turns out, though, there is a modification to this truth.
      The trick is to limit the number of recipients in incoming
      messages to one, so that the message can be analyzed in
      accordance with the settings and data that belongs to the
      corresponding user.
    </p><p>
      To do this, you would accept the first <span class="command"><strong>RCPT
      TO:</strong></span>, then issue a SMTP <span class="command"><strong>451</strong></span> (defer)
      response to subsequent commands.  If the caller is a
      well-behaved MTA, it will know how to interpret this response,
      and try later.  (If it is confused, then, well, it is probably a
      sender from which you don't want to receive mail in the first
      place).
    </p><p>
      Obviously, this is a hack.  Every mail sent to several users at
      your site will be slowed down by 30 minutes or more per
      recipient.  Especially in corporate environments, where it is
      common to see e-mail discussions involving several people on the
      inside and several others on the outside, and where timelines of
      mail deliveries are essential, this is probably not a good
      solution at all.
    </p><p>
      Another issue that mainly pertains to corporate enterprises and
      other large sites is that incoming mail is often forwarded to
      internal machines for delivery, and that recipients don't
      normally have accounts on the mail exchanger.  It may still be
      possible to support user-specific settings and data in these
      situations (e.g. via database lookups or LDAP queries), but you
      may also want to consider whether it's worth the effort.
    </p><p>
      That said, if you are on a small site, and where you are not
      afraid of delayed deliveries, this may be an acceptable way
      to allow each user to fine tune their filtering criteria.
