      You should take care not to reject mail as a result of spam
      filtering if it is forwarded from <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">friendly</span>&#8221;</span>
      sources, such as:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Your backup MX hosts, if any.  Supposedly, these have
	  already filtered out most of the junk (see <a class="xref" href="multimx.html" title="1. Multiple Incoming Mail Exchangers">Multiple Incoming Mail Exchangers</a>).
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Mailing lists, to which you or your users subscribe. You may
	  still filter such mail (it may not be as criticial if it
	  ends up in a black hole). However, if you reject the mail,
	  you may end up causing the list server to automatically
	  unsubscribe the recipient.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Other accounts belonging to the recipient.  Again,
	  rejections will generate collateral spam, and/or create
	  problems for the host that forwards the mail.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
      You may see a logistical issue with the last two of these
      sources: They are specific to each recipient.  How to you allow
      each user to specify which hosts they want to whitelist, and
      then use such individual whitelists in a system-wide SMTP-time
      filtering setup?  If the message is forwarded to several
      recipients at your site (as may often be true in the case of
      a mailing list), how do you decide whose whitelist to use?
    </p><p>
      There is no magic bullet here.  This is one of those situations
      where we just have to do a bit of work.  You can decide to
      accept all mails, regardless of spam classification, so long as
      it is sent from a host in the whitelist of any one of the
      recipients.  For instance, in response to each <span class="command"><strong>RCPT
      TO:</strong></span> command, we can match the sending host against the
      corresponding user's whitelist.  If found, set a flag that will
      prevent a subsequent rejection.  Effectively, you are using an
      <span class="emphasis"><em>aggregate</em></span> of each recipient's whitelist.
    </p><p>
      The implementation appendices cover this in more detail.
