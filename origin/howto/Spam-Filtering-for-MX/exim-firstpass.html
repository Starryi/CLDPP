      In the acl section (following <code class="option">begin acl</code>), we
      need to define these ACLs.  In doing so, we will incorporate
      some of the basic
      <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xref" href="techniques.html" title="Chapter 2. Techniques">Techniques</a></em></span>
      described earlier in this document, namely
      <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xref" href="dnschecks.html" title="2. DNS Checks">DNS checks</a></em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xref" href="smtpchecks.html" title="3. SMTP checks">SMTP checks</a></em></span>. 
    </p><p>
      In this pass, we will do most of the checks in <a class="xref" href="exim-firstpass.html#acl_rcpt_to_1" title="4.4. acl_rcpt_to">acl_rcpt_to</a>, and leave the other ACLs largely
      empty.  That is because most of the commonly used ratware does
      not understand rejections early in the SMTP transaction - it
      keeps trying.  On the other hand, most ratware clients give up
      if the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span> fails.
    </p><p>
      We create all these ACLs, however, because we will use them
      later.
