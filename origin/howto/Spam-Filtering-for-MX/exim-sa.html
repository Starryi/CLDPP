      Invoking SpamAssassin at SMTP-time is commonly done in either
      of two ways in Exim:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Via the <code class="option">spam</code> condition offered by
          <code class="option">Exiscan-ACL</code>.  This is the mechanism we
          will cover here.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Via <code class="option">SA-Exim</code>, another utility written by
          Marc Merlins (<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:marc%20(at)%20merlins.org">marc (at) merlins.org</a>&gt;</code>),
          specifically for running SpamAssassin at SMTP time in Exim.
          This program operates through Exim's
          <code class="option">local_scan()</code> interface, either patched
          directly into the Exim source code, or via Marc's own
          <code class="option">dlopen()</code> plugin (which, by the way, is
          included in Debian's <code class="option">exim4-daemon-light</code>
          and <code class="option">exim4-daemon-heavy</code> packages).
        </p><p>
          <code class="option">SA-Exim</code> offers some other features as
          well, namely <span class="emphasis"><em>greylisting</em></span> and
          <span class="emphasis"><em>teergrubing</em></span>.  However, because the
          scan happens after the message data has been received,
          neither of these two features may be as useful as they
          would be earlier in the SMTP transaction.
        </p><p>
          <code class="option">SA-Exim</code> can be found at:
          <a class="ulink" href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/sa.html" target="_top">http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/sa.html</a>.
        </p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exim-sa-exiscan"></a>10.1. Invoke SpamAssassin via Exiscan</h3></div></div></div><p>
        <code class="option">Exiscan-ACL</code>'s
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="option">spam</code></span>&#8221;</span> condition passes the
        message through either SpamAssassin or Brightmail, and
        triggers if these indicate that the message is junk.  By
        default, it connects to a SpamAssassin daemon
        (<code class="option">spamd</code>) running on
        <code class="option">localhost</code>.  The host address and port can be
        changed by adding a <code class="option">spamd_address</code> setting in
        the <span class="emphasis"><em>main</em></span> section of the Exim
        configuration file.  For more information, see the
        <code class="option">exiscan-acl-spect.txt</code> file included with the
        patch.
      </p><p>
        In our implementation, we are going to reject messages
        classified as spam.  However, we would like to keep a copy of
        such messages in a separate mail folder, at least for the time
        being.  This is so that the user can periodically scan for
        <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#falsepos" title="False Positive">False Positive</a>s.
      </p><p>
        Exim offers <span class="emphasis"><em>controls</em></span> that can be applied
        to a message that is accepted, such as
        <code class="option">freeze</code>.  The Exiscan-ACL patch adds one more
        of these controls, namely <code class="option">fakereject</code>.
        This causes the following SMTP response:

</p><pre class="screen">
550-FAKEREJECT id=<em class="parameter"><code>message-id</code></em>
550-Your message has been rejected but is being kept for evaluation.
550 If it was a legit message, it may still be delivered to the target recipient(s).
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        We can incorporate this feature into our implementation, by
        inserting the following snippet in <a class="xref" href="exim-firstpass.html#acl_data_1" title="4.5. acl_data">acl_data</a>, prior to the final
        <code class="option">accept</code> statement:

</p><pre class="screen">
  # Invoke SpamAssassin to obtain $spam_score and $spam_report.
  # Depending on the classification, $acl_m9 is set to "ham" or "spam".
  #
  # If the message is classified as spam, pretend to reject it. 
  #
  warn
    set acl_m9  = ham
    spam        = mail
    set acl_m9  = spam
    control     = fakereject
    logwrite    = :reject: Rejected spam (score $spam_score): $spam_report

  # Add an appropriate X-Spam-Status: header to the message.
  #
  warn
    message     = X-Spam-Status: \
                  ${if eq {$acl_m9}{spam}{Yes}{No}} (score $spam_score)\
                  ${if def:spam_report {: $spam_report}}
    logwrite    = :main: Classified as $acl_m9 (score $spam_score)

</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        In this example, <code class="varname">$acl_m9</code> is initially set to
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">ham</span>&#8221;</span>.  Then SpamAssassin is invoked as the user
        <code class="option">mail</code>. If the message is classified as spam,
        then <code class="varname">$acl_m9</code> is set to <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">spam</span>&#8221;</span>,
        and the <code class="option">FAKEREJECT</code> response above is issued.
        Finally, an <code class="option">X-Spam-Status:</code> header is added to
        the message.  The idea is that the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mda" title="Mail Delivery Agent">Mail Delivery Agent</a> or
        the recipient's <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mua" title="Mail User Agent">Mail User Agent</a> can use this header to
        filter junk mail into a separate folder.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exim-sa-config"></a>10.2. Configure SpamAssassin</h3></div></div></div><p>
        By default, SpamAssassin presents its report in a verbose,
        table-like format, mainly suitable for inclusion in or
        attachment to the message body.  In our case, we want a terse
        report, suitable for the <code class="option">X-Spam-Status:</code>
        header in the example above.  To do this, we add the following
        snippet in its site specific configuration file
        (<code class="option">/etc/spamassassin/local.cf</code>,
        <code class="option">/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf</code>, or similar):

</p><pre class="screen">
### Report template
clear_report_template

</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Also, a <a class="link" href="gloss.html#bayesian" title="Bayesian Filters">Bayesian</a> scoring
        feature is built in, and is turned on by default.  We normally
        want to turn this off, because it requires training that will
        be specific to each user, and thus is not suitable for
        system-wide SMTP time filtering:

</p><pre class="screen">
### Disable Bayesian scoring
use_bayes 0
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        For these changes to take effect, you have to restart the
        SpamAssassin daemon (<span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span>).
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exim-per-user"></a>10.3. User Settings and Data</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Say you have a number of users that want to specify their
        individual SpamAssassin preferences, such as the spam
        threshold, acceptable languages and character sets,
        white/blacklisted senders, and so on.  Or perhaps they really
        want to be able to make use of SpamAssassin's native Bayesian
        scoring (though I don't see why<a href="#ftn.idm1828" class="footnote" name="idm1828"><sup class="footnote">[17]</sup></a>).
      </p><p>
        As discussed in the <a class="xref" href="usersettings.html" title="4. User Settings and Data">User Settings and Data</a> section
        earlier in the document, there is a way for this to happen.
        We need to limit the number of recipients we accept per
        incoming mail delivery to one.  We accept the first
        <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span> command issued by the caller, then
        defer subsequent ones using a <span class="command"><strong>451</strong></span> SMTP
        response.  As with <a class="link" href="exim-greylisting.html" title="6. Adding Greylisting Support">greylisting</a>, if the caller
        is a well-behaved MTA it will know how to interpret this
        response, and retry later.

          In the <a class="xref" href="exim-final.html#acl_rcpt_to_final" title="14.4. acl_rcpt_to">acl_rcpt_to</a>, we insert the
          following statement after validating the recipient address,
          but before any <code class="option">accept</code> statements pertaining
          to unauthenticated deliveries from remote hosts to local
          users (i.e. before any greylist checks, envelope signature
          checks, etc):

          In <a class="xref" href="exim-final.html#acl_data_final" title="14.5. acl_data">acl_data</a>, we modify the
          <code class="option">spam</code> condition given in the previous

          specified in the local part of the recipient address.

          Note that instead of using Exim's
          <code class="option">${local_part:...}</code> function to get the
          username, we manually extracted the portion before any
          <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">@</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">=</span>&#8221;</span> character.  This is
          because we will use the latter character in our <a class="link" href="exim-sign.html" title="11. Adding Envelope Sender Signatures">envelope signature</a> scheme, to
          follow.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="exim-per-user-sa"></a>10.3.3. Enable per-user settings in SpamAssassin</h4></div></div></div><p>
          Let us now again look at SpamAssassin.  First of all, you
          may choose to remove the <code class="option">use_bayes 0</code>
          setting that we previously added in its site-wide
          configuration file.  In any case, each user will now have
          the ability to decide whether to override this setting for
          themselves.
        </p><p>
          If mailboxes on your system map directly to local UNIX
          accounts with home directories, you are done.  By default,
          the SpamAssassin daemon (<span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span>) performs
          a <code class="option">setuid()</code> to the username we pass to it,
          and stores user data and settings in that user's home
          directory.
        </p><p>
          If this is not the case (for instance, if your mail accounts
          are managed by Cyrus SASL or by another server), you need to
          tell SpamAssassin where to find each user's preferences and
          data files.  Also, <span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span> needs to keep
          running as a specific local user instead of attempting to
          <code class="option">setuid()</code> to a non-existing user.
        </p><p>
          We do these things by specifying the options passed to
          <span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span> at startup:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              On a Debian system, edit the <code class="option">OPTIONS=</code>
              setting in <code class="option">/etc/default/spamassassin</code>.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              On a RedHat system, edit the
              <code class="option">SPAMDOPTIONS=</code> setting in
              <code class="option">/etc/sysconfig/spamassassin</code>.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Others, figure it out.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          The options you need are:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              <code class="option">-u</code> <em class="parameter"><code>username</code></em> -
              specify the user under which <span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span>
              will run (e.g. <code class="option">mail</code>)
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              <code class="option">-x</code> - disable configuration files in
              user's home directory.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              <code class="option">--virtual-config-dir=/var/lib/spamassassin/%u</code>
              - specify where per-user settings and data are stored.
              <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">%u</span>&#8221;</span> is replaced with the calling username.
              <span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span> must be able to create or
              modify this directory:
</p><pre class="screen">
# mkdir /var/lib/spamassassin
# chown -R mail:mail /var/lib/spamassassin
</pre><p>
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          Needless to say, after making these changes, you need to
          restart <span class="command"><strong>spamd</strong></span>.
        </p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0"><div id="ftn.idm1828" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm1828" class="para"><sup class="para">[17] </sup></a>
          Although it is true that Bayesian training is specific to
          each user, it should be noted that SpamAssassin's
          Bayesian classifier is, IMHO, not that stellar in any case.
          Especially I find this to be the case since spammers have
          learned to defeat such systems by seeding random dictionary
          words or stories in their mail (e.g.  in the metadata of
          HTML messages).
