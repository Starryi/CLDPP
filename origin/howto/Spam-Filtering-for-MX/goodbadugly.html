      Some filtering techniques are more suitable for use during the
      SMTP transaction than others.  Some are simply better than
      others.  Nearly all have their proponents and opponents.
    </p><p>
      Needless to say, these controversies extend to the methods
      described here as well.  For instance:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Some argue that <a class="xref" href="dnschecks.html" title="2. DNS Checks">DNS checks</a> penalize
	  individual mail senders purely based on their Internet
	  Service Provider (ISP), not on the merits of their
	  particular message.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Some point out that ratware traps like <a class="xref" href="smtpdelays.html" title="1. SMTP Transaction Delays">SMTP transaction delays</a> and <a class="xref" href="greylisting.html" title="4. Greylisting">Greylisting</a> are
	  easily overcome and will be less effective over time, while
	  continuing to degrade the Quality of Service for legitimate
	  mail.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Some find that <a class="xref" href="senderauth.html" title="5. Sender Authorization Schemes">Sender Authorization Schemes</a> like the <a class="xref" href="senderauth.html#spf" title="5.1. Sender Policy Framework (SPF)">Sender Policy Framework</a> give ISPs a way to lock their customers in,
	  and do not adequately address users who roam between
	  different networks or who forward their e-mail from one host
	  to another.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
      I will steer away from most of these controversies.  Instead, I
      will try to provide a functional description of the various
      techniques available, including their possible side effects, and
      then talk a little about my own experiences using some of them.
    </p><p>
      That said, there are some filtering methods in use today that I
      deliberately omit from this document:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Challenge/response systems (like <a class="ulink" href="http://tmda.net/" target="_top">TMDA</a>).  These are not
	  suitable for SMTP time filtering, as they rely on first
	  accepting the mail, then returning a confirmation request to
	  the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a>.  This technique is therefore
	  outside the scope of this document.
	  <a href="#ftn.idm452" class="footnote" name="idm452"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#bayesian" title="Bayesian Filters">Bayesian Filters</a>.  These require training specific
	  to a particular user, and/or a particular language.  As
	  such, these too are not normally suitable for use during the
	  SMTP transaction (But see <a class="xref" href="usersettings.html" title="4. User Settings and Data">User Settings and Data</a>).
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#micropay" title="Micropayment Schemes">Micropayment Schemes</a> are not really suitable for
	  weeding out junk mail until all the world's legitimate mail
	  is sent with a virtual <span class="emphasis"><em>postage stamp</em></span>.
	  (Though in the mean time, they can be used for the opposite
	  purpose - that is, to accept mail carrying the stamp that
	  would otherwise be rejected).
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
      Generally, I have attempted to offer techniques that are as
      precise as possible, and to go to great lengths to avoid <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#falsepos" title="False Positive">False Positive</a>s.  People's e-mail is important to them,
      and they spend time and effort writing it.  In my view,
      willfully using techniques or tools that reject large amounts of
      legitimate mail is a show of disrespect, both to the people that
      are directly affected and to the Internet as a whole.
      <a href="#ftn.idm465" class="footnote" name="idm465"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>

      This is especially true for SMTP-time system wide filtering,
      because end recipients usually have little or no control over
      the criteria being used to filter their mail.
    </p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0"><div id="ftn.idm452" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm452" class="para"><sup class="para">[2] </sup></a>
	      Personally I do not think challenge/response systems are
	      a good idea in any case.  They generate <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#colspam" title="Collateral Spam">Collateral Spam</a>, they require special attention for
	      mail sent from automated sources such as monthly bank
	      statements, and they degrade the usability of e-mail as
	      people need to jump through hoops to get in touch with
	      each other.  Many times, senders of legitimate mail will
	      not bother to or know that they need to follow up to the
	      confirmation request, and the mail is lost.
	    </p></div><div id="ftn.idm465" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm465" class="para"><sup class="para">[3] </sup></a>
	  My view stands in sharp contrast to that of a large number
	  of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">spam hacktivists</span>&#8221;</span>, such as the maintainers
	  of the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spews.org/" target="_top">SPEWS</a>
	  <a class="link" href="dnschecks.html#dnsbl" title="2.1. DNS Blacklists">blacklist</a>.  One of the stated
	  aims of this list is precisely to inflict <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#coldamage" title="Collateral Damage">Collateral Damage</a> as a means of putting pressure on ISPs
	  to react on abuse complaints.  Listing complaints are
	  typically met with knee-jerk responses such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bother
	  your ISP, not us</span>&#8221;</span>, or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">get another ISP</span>&#8221;</span>.
	</p><p>
	  Often, these are not viable options.  Consider developing
	  countries.  For that matter, consider the fact that nearly
	  everywhere, broadband providers are regulated monopolies.  I
	  believe that these attitudes illustrate the exact crux of
	  the problem with trusting these groups.
	</p><p>
	  Put plainly, there are much better and more accurate ways
	  available to filter junk mail.
