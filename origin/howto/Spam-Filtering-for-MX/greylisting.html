      The <span class="emphasis"><em>greylisting</em></span> concept is presented by
      Evan Harris in a whitepaper at:
      <a class="ulink" href="http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/" target="_top">http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/</a>.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="greylisting-theory"></a>4.1. How it works</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Like <a class="xref" href="smtpdelays.html" title="1. SMTP Transaction Delays">SMTP transaction delays</a>, greylisting is a simple but
	highly effective mechanism to weed out messages that are being
	delivered via <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#ratware" title="Ratware">Ratware</a>.  The idea is to
	establish whether a prior relationship exists between the
	sender and the receiver of a message.  For most legitimate
	mail it does, and the delivery proceeds normally.
      </p><p>
	On the other hand, if no prior relationship exists, the
	delivery is temporariliy rejected (with a
	<span class="command"><strong>451</strong></span> SMTP response).  Legitimate MTAs will
	treat this response accordingly, and retry the delivery in a
	little while<a href="#ftn.noretrysenders" class="footnote" name="noretrysenders"><sup class="footnote">[9]</sup></a>.  In contrast, ratware will either make repeated
	delivery attempts right away, and/or simply give up and move
	on to the next target in its address list.
      </p><p>
	Three pieces of information from a delivery attempt, referred
	to a as a <span class="emphasis"><em>triplet</em></span> are used to uniquely
	identify the relationship between a sender and a receiver:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    The <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a>.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    The sending host's IP address.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    The <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envto" title="Envelope Recipient">Envelope Recipient</a>.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
	If a delivery attempt was temporarily rejected, this triplet
	is cached.  It remains greylisted for a given amount of time
	(nominally 1 hour), after which it is whitelisted, and new
	delivery attempts would succeed.  If no new delivery attempts
	occur prior to a given timeout (nominally 4 hours), then the
	triplet expires from the cache.
      </p><p>
	If a whitelisted triplet has not been seen for an extended
	duration (at minimum one month, to account for monthly billing
	statements and the like), it is expired.  This prevents
	unlimited growth of the list.
      </p><p>
	These timeouts are taken from Evan Harris' original
	greylisting whitepaper (or should we say, ahem,
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">greypaper</span>&#8221;</span>?)  Some people have found that a
	larger timeout may be needed before greylisted triplets
	expire, because certain ISPs (such as
	<span class="emphasis"><em>earthlink.net</em></span>) retry deliveries only
	every 6 hours or similar.
	<a href="#ftn.idm914" class="footnote" name="idm914"><sup class="footnote">[10]</sup></a>
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="greylisting-multimx"></a>4.2. Greylisting in Multiple Mail Exchangers</h3></div></div></div><p>
	If you operate more than one incoming mail exchangers, and
	each exchanger maintains its own greylisting cache, then:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    First-time deliveries from a given sender to one of your
	    users may theoretically be delayed up to
	    <em class="parameter"><code>N</code></em> times the initial 1-hour delay,
	    where <em class="parameter"><code>N</code></em> is the number of mail
	    exchangers.  This is because the message would likely be
	    retried at a different server than the one that issued the
	    <span class="command"><strong>451</strong></span> response to the initial delivery.
	    In the worst case, the sender host may not get around to
	    retrying the delivery to the first exchanger for 4 hours,
	    or until after the greylist triplet has expired, thereby
	    causing the delivery attempt to be rejected over and over
	    again, until the sender gives up (usually after 4 days or
	    so).
	  </p><p>
	    In practice, this is unlikely.  If a delivery attempt
	    temporarily fails, the sender host normally retries the
	    delivery immediately, using a different MX.  Thus, after
	    one hour, any of these MX hosts would accept the message.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Even after a triplet has been whitelisted in one of your
	    MXs, the next message with the same triplet will be
	    greylisted if it is delivered to a different MX.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
	For these reasons, you may want to implement a solution where
	the database of greylist triplets is shared between your
	incoming mail exchangers.  However, since the machine that
	hosts this database would become a single point of failure,
	you would have to take a sensible action if that machine is
	down (e.g. accept all deliveries). Or you could use database
	replication techniques and have the SMTP server fall back to
	one of the replicating servers for lookups.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="greylisting-results"></a>4.3. Results</h3></div></div></div><p>
	In my own experience, <span class="emphasis"><em>greylisting</em></span> gets
	rid of about 90% of unique junk mail deliveries,
	<span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> most of the <a class="xref" href="smtpchecks.html" title="3. SMTP checks">SMTP checks</a> previously described are applied!  If
	you used greylisting as a first defense, it would likely catch
	an even higher percentage of incoming junk mail.
      </p><p>
	Conversely, there are virtually zero <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#falsepos" title="False Positive">False Positive</a>s
	resulting from this technique.  All major <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mta" title="Mail Transport Agent">Mail Transport Agent</a>s
	perform delivery retries after a temporary failure, in a manner
	that will eventually result in a successful delivery.
      </p><p>
	The downside to greylisting is a legitimate mail from people
	who have not e-mailed a particular recipient in the past is
	subject to a one-hour delay (or maybe several hours, if you
	operate several MX hosts).

	  Although rare, some <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">legitimate</span>&#8221;</span> bulk mail
	  senders, such as <code class="option">groups.yahoo.com</code>, will not
	  retry temporarily failed deliveries.  Evan Harris has
	  compiled a list of such senders, suitable for whitelisting
	  purposes: 
	  <a class="ulink" href="http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/schema/whitelist_ip.txt?view=markup" target="_top">http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/schema/whitelist_ip.txt?view=markup</a>.

	    Large sites often use multiple servers to handle outgoing
	    mail.  For instance, one server or pool of servers may be
	    used for immediate delivery.  If the first delivery
	    attempt fails, the mail is handed off to a fallback server
	    which has been tuned for large queues.  Hence, from such
	    sites, the first two delivery attempts will fail.
