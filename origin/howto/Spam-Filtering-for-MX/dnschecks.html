      Some indication of the integrity of a particular peer can be
      gleaned directly from the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dns" title="Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS), even
      before SMTP commands are issued.  In particular, various DNS
      blacklists can be consulted to find out if a particular IP
      address is known to violate or fulfill certain criteria, and a
      simple pair of forward/reverse (DNS/rDNS) lookups can be used as
      a vague indicator of the host's general integrity.
    </p><p>
      Moreover, various data items presented during the SMTP dialogue
      (such as the name presented in the Hello greeting) can be
      subjected to DNS validation, once it becomes available.  For a
      discussion on these items, see the section on <a class="xref" href="smtpchecks.html" title="3. SMTP checks">SMTP checks</a>, below.
    </p><p>
      A word of caution, though.  DNS checks are not always conclusive
      (e.g. a required DNS server may not be responding), and not
      always indicative of spam.  Moreover, if you have a very busy
      site, they can be expensive in terms of processing time per
      message.  That said, they can provide useful information for
      logging purposes, and/or as part of a more holistic integrity
      check.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dnsbl"></a>2.1. DNS Blacklists</h3></div></div></div><p>
	DNS blacklists (DNSbl's, formerly called "Real-time Black-hole
	Lists" after the original blacklist, "mail-abuse.org") make up
	perhaps the most common tool to perform transaction-time spam
	blocking.  The receiving server performs one or more rDNS
	lookups of the peer's IP address within various DNSbl zones,
	such as "dnsbl.sorbs.net", "opm.blitzed.org",
	"lists.dsbl.org", and so forth.  If a matching DNS record is
	found, a typical action is to reject the mail delivery.
	<a href="#ftn.idm649" class="footnote" name="idm649"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a>
      </p><p>
	If in addition to the DNS address ("A" record) you look up the
	"TXT" record of an entry, you will typically receive a
	one-line description of the listing, suitable for inclusion in
	a SMTP reject response.  To try this out, you can use the
	"host" command provided on most Linux and UNIX systems:
	</p><pre class="screen">host -t txt 2.0.0.127.dnsbl.sorbs.net</pre><p>
      </p><p>
	There are currently hundreds of these lists available, each
	with different listing criteria, and with different
	listing/unlisting policies. Some lists even combine several
	listing criteria into the same DNSbl, and issue different data
	in response to the rDNS lookup, depending on which criterion
	affects the address provided.  For instance, a rDNS lookup
	against <code class="option">sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org</code> returns
	127.0.0.2 for IP addresses that are believed by the SpamHaus
	staff to directly belong to spammers and their providers,
	127.0.0.4 response for <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#zombie" title="Zombie Host">Zombie Host</a>s, or a
	127.0.0.6 response for <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#openproxy" title="Open Proxy">Open Proxy</a> servers.
      </p><p>
	Unfortunately, many of these lists contain large blocks of IP
	addresses that are not directly responsible for the alleged
	violations, don't have clear listing / delisting policies,
	and/or post misleading information about which addresses are
	listed<a href="#ftn.idm661" class="footnote" name="idm661"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a>.

	The blind trust in such lists often cause a large amount of
	what is referred to as <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#coldamage" title="Collateral Damage">Collateral Damage</a> (not to be
	confused with <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#colspam" title="Collateral Spam">Collateral Spam</a>).
      </p><p>
	For that reason, rather than rejecting mail deliveries
	outright based on a single positive response from DNS
	blacklists, many administrators prefer to use these lists in a
	more nuanced fashion.  They may consult several lists, and
	assign a "score" to each positive response.  If the total
	score for a given IP address reaches a given threshold,
	deliveries from that address are rejected.  This is how DNS
	blacklists are used by filtering software such as
	SpamAssassin (<a class="xref" href="datachecks.html#spamscanners" title="6.7. Spam Scanners">Spam Scanners</a>).
      </p><p>
	One could also use such lists as one of several triggers for
	SMTP transaction delays on incoming connections
	(a.k.a. "teergrubing").  If a host is listed in a DNSbl, your
	server would delay its response to every SMTP command issued
	by the peer for, say, 20 seconds.  Several other criteria can
	be used as triggers for such delays; see the section on 
	<a class="xref" href="smtpdelays.html" title="1. SMTP Transaction Delays">SMTP transaction delays</a>.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="rdns"></a>2.2. DNS Integrity Check</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Another way to use DNS is to perform a reverse lookup of the
	peer's IP address, then a forward lookup of the resulting
	name.  If the original IP address is included in the result,
	its DNS integrity has been validated.  Otherwise, the DNS
	information for the connecting host is not valid.
      </p><p>
	Rejecting mails based on this criterion may be an option if
	you are a militant member of the DNS police, setting up an
	incoming MX for your own personal domain, and don't mind
	rejecting legitimate mail as a way to impress upon the sender
	that they need to ask their own system administrator to clean
	up their DNS records.  For everyone else, the result of a DNS
	integrity check should probably only be used as one data point
	in a larger set of heuristics.  Alternatively, as above, using
	SMTP transaction delays for misconfigured hosts may not be a
	bad idea.

	    Similar lists exist for different purposes.  For instance,
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bondedsender.org</span>&#8221;</span> is a <span class="emphasis"><em>DNS

	    posted a financial bond that will be debited in the event
	    that spam originates from that address.  Other lists
	    contain IP addresses in use by specific countries,
	    specific ISPs, etc.
	  </p></div><div id="ftn.idm661" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm661" class="para"><sup class="para">[6] </sup></a>
	  For instance, the outgoing mail exchangers (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">smart
	  hosts</span>&#8221;</span>) of the world's largest Internet Service
	  Provider (ISP), comcast.net, is as of the time of this
	  writing included in the SPEWS <span class="emphasis"><em>Level 1</em></span>
	  list.  Not wholly undeserved from the viewpoint that
	  Comcast needs to more effectively enforce their own AUP,
	  but this listing does affect 30% of all US internet users,
	  mostly <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">innocent</span>&#8221;</span> subscribers such as myself.
	</p><p>
	  To make matters worse, information published in the <a class="ulink" href="http://spews.org/faq.html" target="_top">SPEWS FAQ</a> states:
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>
	    The majority of the Level 1 list is made up of netblocks
	    owned by the spammers or spam support operations
	    themselves, with few or no other legitimate customers
	    detected.
	  </em></span>
	  Technically, this information is accurate if (a) you
	  consider Comcast a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">spam support operation</span>&#8221;</span>,
	  and (b) pay attention to the word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">other</span>&#8221;</span>.
	  Word parsing aside, this information is clearly misleading.
