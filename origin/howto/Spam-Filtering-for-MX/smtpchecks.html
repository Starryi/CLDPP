      Once the SMTP dialogue is underway, you can perform various
      checks on the commands and arguments presented by the remote
      host.  For instance, you will want to ensure that the name
      presented in the Hello greeting is valid.
    </p><p>
      However, even if you decide to reject the delivery attempt early
      in the SMTP transaction, you may not want to perform the actual
      rejection right away.  Instead, you may stall the sender with
      SMTP transaction delays until after the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT
      TO:</strong></span>, then reject the mail at that point.
    </p><p>
      The reason is that some ratware does not understand rejections
      early in the SMTP transaction; they keep trying.  On the other
      hand, most of them give up if the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span>
      fails.
    </p><p>
      Besides, this gives a nice opportunity to do a little
      <span class="emphasis"><em>teergrubing</em></span>.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="helocheck"></a>3.1. Hello (HELO/EHLO) checks</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Per RFC 2821, the first SMTP command issued by the client
	should be EHLO (or if unsupported, HELO), followed by its
	primary, <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#fqdn" title="Fully Qualified Domain Name">Fully Qualified Domain Name</a>.  This is known as the Hello
	greeting.  If no meaningful FQDN is available, the client can
	supply its IP address enclosed in square brackets:
	"[1.2.3.4]".  This last form is known as an IPv4 address
	"literal" notation.
      </p><p>
	Quite understandably, <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#ratware" title="Ratware">Ratware</a> rarely present
	their own FQDN in the Hello greeting.  Rather, greetings from
	ratware usually attempt to conceal the sending host's
	identity, and/or to generate confusing and/or misleading
	"Received:" trails in the message header.  Some examples of
	such greetings are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Unqualified names (i.e. names without a period), such as
	    the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">local part</span>&#8221;</span> (username) of the
	    recipient address.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    A plain IP address (i.e. not an IP literal); usually
	    yours, but can be a random one.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Your domain name, or the FQDN of your server.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Third party domain names, such as
	    <code class="option">yahoo.com</code> and
	    <code class="option">hotmail.com</code>.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Non-existing domain names, or domain names with
	    non-existing name servers.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    No greeting at all.
	  </p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="helosyntax"></a>3.1.1. Simple HELO/EHLO syntax checks</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  Some of these RFC 2821 violations are both easy to check
	  against, and clear indications that the sending host is
	  running some form of <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#ratware" title="Ratware">Ratware</a>.  You can
	  reject such greetings -- either right away, or e.g. after
	  the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span> command.
	</p><p>
	  First, feel free to reject plain IP addresses in the Hello
	  greeting.  Even if you wish to generously allow everything
	  RFC 2821 mandates, recommends, and suggests, you will note
	  that IP addresses should always be enclosed in square
	  brackets when presented in lieu of a name.
	  <a href="#ftn.idm718" class="footnote" name="idm718"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a>
	</p><p>
	  In particular, you may wish to issue a strongly worded
	  rejection message to hosts that introduce themselves using
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> IP address - or for that matter,
	  your host name.  They are plainly lying.  Perhaps you want
	  to stall the sender with an exceedingly long SMTP
	  transaction delay in response to such a greeting; say,
	  hours.
	</p><p>
	  For that matter, my own experience indicates that
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> legitimate sites on the internet
	  present themselves to other internet sites using an IP
	  address literal (the [x.y.z.w] notation) either.  Nor should
	  they; all hosts sending mail directly on the internet should
	  use their valid <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#fqdn" title="Fully Qualified Domain Name">Fully Qualified Domain Name</a>.  The only use of use
	  of IP literals I have come across is from mail user agents
	  on my local area network, such as Ximian Evolution,
	  configured to use my server as outgoing SMTP server
	  (smarthost).  Indeed, I only accept literals from my own
	  LAN.
	</p><p>
	  You may or may not also wish to reject unqualified host
	  names (host names without a period).  I find that these are
	  rarely (but not never - how's that for double negative
	  negations) legitimate.
	</p><p>
	  Similarly, you can reject host names that contain invalid
	  characters.  For internet domains, only alphanumeric letters
	  and hyphen are valid characters; a hyphen is not allowed as
	  the first character.  (You may also want to consider the
	  underscore a valid character, because it is quite common to
	  see this from misconfigured, but ultimately well-meaning,
	  Windows clients).
	</p><p>
	  Finally, if you receive a <span class="command"><strong>MAIL FROM:</strong></span>
	  command without first having received a Hello greeting,
	  well, polite people greet first.
	</p><p>
	  On my servers, I reject greetings that fail any of these
	  syntax checks.  However, the rejection does not actually
	  take place until after the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span>
	  command.  In the mean time, I impose a 20 second transaction
	  delay after each SMTP command (<span class="command"><strong>HELO/EHLO</strong></span>,
	  <span class="command"><strong>MAIL FROM:</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span>).
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="heloverify"></a>3.1.2. Verifying the Hello greeting via DNS</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  Hosts that make it this far have presented at least a
	  superficially credible greeting.  Now it is time to verify
	  the provided name via DNS.  You can:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Perform a forward lookup of the provided name, and
	      match the result against the peer's IP address
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Perform a reverse lookup of the peer's IP address, and
	      match it against name provided in the greeting.
	    </p></li></ul></div><p>
	  If either of these two checks succeeds, the name has been
	  verified.
	</p><p>
	  Your MTA may have a built-in option to perform this check.
	  For instance, in Exim (see <a class="xref" href="exim.html" title="Appendix A. Exim Implementation">Appendix A, <i>Exim Implementation</i></a>),
	  you want to set "helo_try_verify_hosts = *", and create ACLs
	  that take action based on the "verify = helo" condition.
	</p><p>
	  This check is a little more expensive in terms of processing
	  time and network resources than the simple syntax checks.
	  Moreover, unlike the syntax checks, a mismatch does not
	  always indicate ratware; several large internet sites, such
	  as hotmail.com, yahoo.com, and amazon.com, frequently
	  present unverifiable Hello greetings.
	</p><p>
	  On my servers, I do a DNS validation of the Hello greeting
	  if I am not already stalling the sender with transaction
	  delays based on prior checks.  Then, if this check fails, I
	  impose a 20 second delay on every SMTP command from this
	  point forward.  I also prepare a
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X-HELO-Warning:</span>&#8221;</span> header that I will later add
	  to the message(s), and use to increase the <a class="link" href="datachecks.html#spamassassin">SpamAssassin</a> score for
	  possible rejection after the message data has been received.

	After the client has presented the
	<span class="command"><strong>MAIL FROM:</strong></span> &lt;<em class="parameter"><code>address</code></em>&gt;

	<a href="#ftn.idm756" class="footnote" name="idm756"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a>

	  Does the supplied address conform to the format

	  In the case where you and your users send all your outgoing

	  messages from other hosts in which the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">domain</span>&#8221;</span>
	  of the sender address is your own.
	</p><p>

	  If the address is local, is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">local part</span>&#8221;</span>
	  (the part before the @ sign) a valid mailbox on your
	  system?
	</p><p>
	  If the address is remote, does the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">domain</span>&#8221;</span>
	  (the part after the @ sign) exist?
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="callback"></a>3.2.4. Sender Callout Verification</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  This is a mechanism that is offered by some MTAs, such as
	  Exim and Postfix, to validate the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">local part</span>&#8221;</span>
	  of a remote sender address.  In Postfix terminology, it is
	  called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Sender Address Verification</span>&#8221;</span>.
	</p><p>
	  Your server contacts the MX for the
	  <em class="parameter"><code>domain</code></em> provided in the sender
	  address, attempting to initiate a secondary SMTP transaction
	  as if delivering mail to this address.  It does not actually
	  send any mail; rather, once the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span>
	  command has been either accepted or rejected by the remote
	  host, your server sends <span class="command"><strong>QUIT</strong></span>.
	</p><p>
	  By default, Exim uses an empty envelope sender address for
	  such callout verifications.  The goal is to determine if a
	  <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a> would be accepted if returned to the
	  sender.
	</p><p>
	  Postfix, on the other hand, defaults to the sender address
	  &lt;<code class="option">postmaster@</code><em class="parameter"><code>domain</code></em>&gt;
	  for address verification purposes
	  (<em class="parameter"><code>domain</code></em> is taken from the
	  <code class="option">$myorigin</code> variable).  For this reason, you
	  may wish to treat this sender address the same way that you
	  treat the NULL envelope sender (for instance, avoid <a class="xref" href="smtpdelays.html" title="1. SMTP Transaction Delays">SMTP transaction delays</a> or <a class="xref" href="greylisting.html" title="4. Greylisting">Greylisting</a>, but
	  require <a class="xref" href="collateral.html#signedsender" title="7.3. Enveloper Sender Signature">Envelope Sender Signature</a>s in recipient
	  addresses).  More on this in the implementation appendices.
	</p><p>
	  You may find that this check alone may not be suitable as a
	  trigger to reject incoming mail.  Occasionally, legitimate
	  mail, such as a recurring billing statement, is sent out
	  from automated services with an invalid return address.
	  Also, an unfortunate side effect of spam is that some users
	  tend to mangle the return address in their outgoing mails
	  (though this may affect the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">From:</span>&#8221;</span> header in
	  the message itself more often than the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a>).
	</p><p>
	  Moreover, this check only verifies that an address is valid,
	  not that it was authentic as the sender of this particular
	  message (but see also <a class="xref" href="collateral.html#signedsender" title="7.3. Enveloper Sender Signature">Envelope Sender Signature</a>).
	</p><p>
	  Finally, there are reports of sites, such as
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">aol.com</span>&#8221;</span>, that will unconditionally blacklist
	  any system from which they discover sender callout requests.
	  These sites may be frequent victims of <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#joejob" title="Joe Job">Joe Job</a>s, and as a result, receive storms of
	  sender callout requests.  By taking part in these DDoS
	  (Distributed Denial-of-Servcie) attacks, you are effectively
	  turning yourself into a pawn in the hands of the spammer.
	</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="rcptchecks"></a>3.3. Recipient Address Checks</h3></div></div></div><p>
	This should be simple, you say.  A recipient address is either
	valid, in which case the mail is delivered, or invalid, in
	which case your MTA takes care of the rejection by default.
      </p><p>
	Let us have a look, shall we?
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="relayprevent"></a>3.3.1. Open Relay Prevention</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Do not relay mail from remote hosts to remote
	  addresses!</em></span> (Unless the sender is authenticated).
	</p><p>
	  This may seem obvious to most of us, but apparently this is
	  a frequently overlooked consideration.  Also, not everyone
	  may have a full grasp of the various internet standards
	  related to e-mail addresses and delivery paths (consider
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">percent hack domains</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bang (!) 
	  paths</span>&#8221;</span>, etc).
	</p><p>
	  If you are unsure whether your MTA acts as an <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#openrelay" title="Open Relay">Open Relay</a>, you can test it via
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">relay-test.mail-abuse.org</span>&#8221;</span>.
	  At a shell prompt on your server, type:

	  </p><pre class="screen">telnet relay-test.mail-abuse.org</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	  This is a service that will use various tests to see whether
	  your SMTP server appears to forward mail to remote e-mail
	  addresses, and/or any number of address <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">hacks</span>&#8221;</span>
	  such as the ones mentioned above.
	</p><p>
	  Preventing your servers from acting as open relays is
	  extremely important.  If your server is an open relay, and
	  spammers find you, you will be listed in numerous DNS
	  blacklists instantly.  If the maintainers of certain other
	  DNS blacklists find you (by probing, and/or by acting on
	  complaints), you will be listed in those for an extended
	  period of time.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="rcptvalid"></a>3.3.2. Recipient Address Lookups</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  This, too may seem banal to most of us.  It is not always so.
	</p><p>
	  If your users' mail accounts and mailboxes are stored
	  directly on your incoming mail exchanger, you can simply
	  check that the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">local part</span>&#8221;</span> of the recipient
	  address corresponds to a valid mailbox.  No problem here.
	</p><p>
	  There are two scenarios where verification of the recipient
	  address is more cumbersome:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	      If your machine is a backup MX for the recipient
	      domain.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      If your machine forwards all mail for your domain to
	      another (presumably internal) server.
	    </p></li></ul></div><p>
	  The alternative to recipient address verification is to
	  accept all recipient addresses within these respective
	  domains, which in turn means that you or the destination
	  server might have to generate a <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a> for
	  recipient addresses that later turn out to be invalid.
	  Ultimately, this means that you would be generating
	  collateral spam.
	</p><p>
	  With that in mind, let us see how we can verify the
	  recipient in the scenarios listed above.
	</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="callforward"></a>3.3.2.1. Recipient Callout Verification</h5></div></div></div><p>
	    This is a mechanism that is offered by some MTAs, such as
	    Exim and Postfix, to verify the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">local part</span>&#8221;</span>
	    of a remote recipient address (see <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="xref" href="smtpchecks.html#callback" title="3.2.4. Sender Callout Verification">Sender Callout Verification</a></em></span> for a description of how
	    this works).  In Postfix terminology, this is called
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Recipient Address Verification</span>&#8221;</span>.
	  </p><p>
	    In this case, server attempts to contact the final
	    destination host to validate each recipient address before
	    you, in turn, accept the <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span>
	    command from your peer.
	  </p><p>
	    This solution is simple and elegant.  It works with any
	    MTA that might be running on the final destination host,
	    and without access to any particular directory service.
	    Moreover, if that MTA happens to perform a fuzzy match on
	    the recipient address (this is the case with Lotus Domino
	    servers), this check will accurately reflect whether the
	    recipient address is eventually going to be accepted or
	    not - something which may not be true for the mechanisms
	    described below.
	  </p><p>
	    Be sure to keep the original <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a>
	    intact for the recipient callout, or the response from the
	    destination host may not be accurate.  For instance, it
	    may reject bounces (i.e. mail with no envelope sender) for
	    system users and aliases, as described in <a class="xref" href="collateral.html#dsnrealuser" title="7.4. Accept Bounces Only for Real Users">Accept Bounces Only for Real Users</a>.
	  </p><p>
	    Among major MTAs, Exim and Postfix support this mechanism.
	  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="ldap"></a>3.3.2.2. Directory Services</h5></div></div></div><p>
	    Another good solution would be a directory service
	    (e.g. one or more LDAP servers) that can be queried by
	    your MTA.  The most common MTAs all support LDAP, NIS,
	    and/or various other backends that are commonly used to
	    provide user account information.
	  </p><p>
	    The main sticking point is that unless the final
	    destination host of the e-mail already uses such a
	    directory service to map user names to mailboxes, there
	    may be some work involved in setting this up.
	  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="replicdir"></a>3.3.2.3. Replicated Mailbox Lists</h5></div></div></div><p>
	    If none of the options above are viable, you could fall
	    back to a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">poor man's directory service</span>&#8221;</span>,
	    where you would periodically copy a current list of
	    mailboxes from the machine where they are located, to your
	    MX host(s).  Your MTA would then consult this list to
	    validate <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span> commands in incoming
	    mail.
	  </p><p>
	    If the machine(s) that host(s) your mailboxes is/are
	    running on some flavor of UNIX or Linux, you could write a
	    script to first generate such a list, perhaps from the
	    local <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">/etc/passwd</span>&#8221;</span> file, and then copy it to
	    your MX host(s) using the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">scp</span>&#8221;</span> command from
	    the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openssh.org/" target="_top">OpenSSH</a>
	    suite.  You could then set up a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cron</span>&#8221;</span> job
	    (type <span class="command"><strong>man cron</strong></span> for details) to
	    periodically run this script.
	  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="rcptmisses"></a>3.3.3. Dictionary Attack Prevention</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Dictionary Attack</em></span> is a term used to
	  describe SMTP transactions where the sending host keeps
	  issuing <span class="command"><strong>RCPT TO:</strong></span> commands to probe for
	  possible recipient addresses based on common names (often
	  alphabetically starting with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">aaron</span>&#8221;</span>, but
	  sometimes starting later in the alphabet, and/or at random).
	  If a particular address is accepted by your server, that
	  address is added into the spammer's arsenal.
	</p><p>
	  Some sites, particularly larger ones, find that they are
	  frequent targets of such attacks.  From the spammer's
	  perspective, chances of finding a given username on a
	  large site is better than on sites with only a few users.
	</p><p>
	  One effective way to combat dictionary attacks is to issue
	  increasing transaction delays for each failed address.  For
	  instance, the first non-existing recipient address can be
