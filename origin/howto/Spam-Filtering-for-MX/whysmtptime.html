	If you receive spam, raise your hands.  Keep them up.
      </p><p>
	If you receive computer virii or other malware, raise your
	hands too.
      </p><p>
	If you receive bogus <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a>s (DSNs), such as
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Message Undeliverable</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Virus
	found</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Please confirm delivery</span>&#8221;</span>, etc,
	related to messages you never sent, raise your hands as well.
	This is known as <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#colspam" title="Collateral Spam">Collateral Spam</a>.
      </p><p>
	This last form is particularly troublesome, because it is
	harder to weed out than <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">standard</span>&#8221;</span> spam or
	malware, and because such messages can be quite confusing to
	recipients who do not possess godly skills in parsing message
	headers.  In the case of virus warnings, this often causes
	unnecessary concern on the recipient's end; more generally, a
	common tendency will be to ignore all such messages, thereby
	missing out on legitimate DSNs.
      </p><p>
	Finally, I want those of you who have lost legitimate mail into
	a big black hole - due to misclassification by spam or virus
	scanners - to lift your feet.
      </p><p>
	If you were standing before and are still standing, I suggest
	that you may not be fully aware of what is happening to your
	mail.  If you have been doing any type of spam filtering, even
	by manually moving mails to the trash can in your mail reader,
	let alone by experimenting with primitive filtering techniques
	such as DNS blacklists (SpamHaus, SPEWS, SORBS...), chances
	are that you have lost some valid mail.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cause"></a>1.2. The Cause</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Spam, just like many other artifacts of greed, is a social
	disease.  Call it affluenza, or whatever you like; lower life
	forms seek to destroy a larger ecosystem, and if successful,
	will actually end up ruining their own habitat in the end.
      </p><p>
	Larger social issues and philosophy aside: You - the mail system
	administrator - face the very concrete and real life dilemma of
	finding a way to deal with all this junk.
      </p><p>
	As it turns out, there are some limitations with the
	conventional way that mail is being processed and delegated by
	the various components of mail transport and delivery
	software.  In a traditional setup, one or more <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mx" title="Mail Exchanger">Mail Exchanger</a>(s) accept most or all incoming mail deliveries
	to addresses within a domain.  Often, they then forward the
	mail to one or more internal machines for further processing,
	and/or delivery to the user's mailboxes.  If any of these
	servers discovers that it is unable to perform the requested
	delivery or function, it generates and returns a DSN back to
	the sender address in the original mail.
      </p><p>
	As organizations started deploying spam and virus scanners,
	they often found that the path of least resistance was to work
	these into the message delivery path, as mail is transferred
	from the incoming <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mx" title="Mail Exchanger">Mail Exchanger</a>(s) to internal delivery
	hosts and/or software.  For instance, a common way filter out
	spam is by <span class="emphasis"><em>routing</em></span> the mail through
	SpamAssassin or other software before it is delivered to a
	user's mailbox, and/or rely on spam filtering capabilities in
	the user's <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mua" title="Mail User Agent">Mail User Agent</a>.
      </p><p>
	Options for dealing with mail that is classified as spam or
	virus at this point are limited:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    You can return a <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a> back to the sender.
	    The problem is that nearly all spam and e-mail borne
	    virii are delivered with faked sender addresses.  If you
	    return this mail, it will invariably go to innocent third
	    parties -- perhaps warning a grandmother in Sweden, who
	    uses Mac OS X and does not know much about computers, that
	    she is infected by the Blaster worm.  In other words, you
	    will be generating <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#colspam" title="Collateral Spam">Collateral Spam</a>.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    You can drop the message into the bit bucket, without
	    sending any notification back to the sender.  This is an
	    even bigger problem in the case of <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#falsepos" title="False Positive">False Positive</a>s, because neither the sender nor
	    the receiver will ever know what happened to the message
	    (or in the receiver's case, that it ever existed).
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Depending on how your users access their mail (for
	    instance, if they access it via the IMAP protocol or use a
	    web-based mail reader, but not if they retreive it over
	    POP-3), you may be able to file it into a separate junk
	    folder for them -- perhaps as an option in their account
	    settings.
	  </p><p>
	    This may be the best of these three options.  Even so, the
	    messages may remain unseen for some time, or simply
	    overlooked as the receiver more-or-less periodically scans
	    through and deletes mail in their <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Junk</span>&#8221;</span>
	    folder.
	  </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="solution"></a>1.3. The Solution</h3></div></div></div><p>
	As you would have guessed by now, the <span class="emphasis"><em>One
	True</em></span> solution to this problem is to do spam and
	virus filtering during the SMTP dialogue from the remote host,
	as the mail is being received by the inbound mail exchanger
	for your domain.  This way, if the mail turns out to be
	undesirable, you can issue a SMTP <span class="emphasis"><em>reject</em></span>
	response rather than face the dilemma described above.  As a
	result:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    You will be able to stop the delivery of most junk mail
	    early in the SMTP transaction, before the actual message
	    data has been received, thus saving you both network
	    bandwidth and CPU processing.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    You will be able to deploy some spam filtering techniques
	    that are not possible later, such as
	    <a class="xref" href="smtpdelays.html" title="1. SMTP Transaction Delays">SMTP transaction delays</a> and
	    <a class="xref" href="greylisting.html" title="4. Greylisting">Greylisting</a>.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    You will be able to notify the sender in case of a
	    delivery failure (e.g. due to an invalid recipient
	    address) without directly generating <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#colspam" title="Collateral Spam">Collateral Spam</a>
	  </p><p>
	    We will discuss how you can avoid causing collateral spam
	    indirectly as a result of rejecting mail forwarded from
	    trusted sources, such as mailing list servers or mail
	    accounts on other sites
	    <a href="#ftn.idm419" class="footnote" name="idm419"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    You will be able to protect yourself against collateral
	    spam from others (such as bogus <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">You have a
	    virus</span>&#8221;</span> messages from anti-virus software).
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
	OK, you can lower your hands now.  If you were standing, and
	your feet disappeared from under you, you can now also stand up
	again.
      </p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0"><div id="ftn.idm419" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm419" class="para"><sup class="para">[1] </sup></a>
		Untrusted third party hosts may still generate
		collateral spam if you reject the mail.  However,
		unless that host is an <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#openproxy" title="Open Proxy">Open Proxy</a> or
		<a class="xref" href="gloss.html#openrelay" title="Open Relay">Open Relay</a>, it presumably delivers
		mail only from legitimate senders, whose addresses are
		valid.  If it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> an Open Proxy or
		SMTP Relay - well, it is better that you reject the
		mail and let it freeze in <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span>
		outgoing mail queue than letting it freeze in yours.
		Eventually, this ought to give the owners of that
		server a clue.
