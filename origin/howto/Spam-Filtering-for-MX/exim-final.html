      congratulations on making it this far!

      The following ACLs incorporate all of the checks we have
      described so in this implementation.  However, some have been
      commented out, for the following reasons:

          either requires additional software to be installed, or
          fairly complex inline configuration by way of additional
          ACLs and definitions in the Exim configuration file.
          I highly recommend it, though.
