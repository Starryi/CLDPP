      Here we implement <a class="xref" href="collateral.html#signedsender" title="7.3. Enveloper Sender Signature">Envelope Sender Signature</a> in our outgoing
      mail, and check for these signatures before accepting incoming
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bounces</span>&#8221;</span> (i.e. mail with no envelope sender).
    </p><p>
      The envelope sender address of outgoing mails from your host
      will be modified as follows:

      </p><pre class="screen"><em class="parameter"><code>sender</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>recipient</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>recipient.domain</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>hash</code></em>@<em class="parameter"><code>sender.domain</code></em></pre><p>
    </p><p>
      However, because this scheme may produce unintended consequences
      (e.g. in the case of mailing list servers), we make it optional
      for your users.  We sign the envelope sender address of outgoing
      mail only if we find a file named
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.return-path-sign</span>&#8221;</span> in the sender's home directory,
      and only if the domain we are sending to is matched in that
      file.   If the file exists, but is empty, all domains match.
    </p><p>
      Similarly, we only require the recipient address to be signed in
      incoming <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bounce</span>&#8221;</span> messages (i.e. messages with no
      envelope sender) if the same file exists in recipient's home
      directory.  Users can exempt specific hosts from this check via
      their user specific whitelist, as described in
      <a class="xref" href="exim-forward.html" title="13. Exempting Forwarded Mail">Exempting Forwarded Mail</a>.
    </p><p>
      Also, because this scheme involves tweaking with routers and
      transports in addition to ACLs, we do not include it in the
      <a class="xref" href="exim-final.html" title="14. Final ACLs">Final ACLs</a> to follow.  If you are able to
      follow the instructions pertaining to those sections, you should
      also be able to add the ACL section as described here.

        First we create an Exim <span class="emphasis"><em>transport</em></span> that
        will be used to sign the envelope sender for remote
        deliveries:

</p><pre class="screen">
remote_smtp_signed:
  debug_print    = "T: remote_smtp_signed for $local_part@$domain"
  driver         = smtp
  max_rcpt       = 1
  return_path    = $sender_address_local_part=$local_part=$domain=\
                   ${hash_8:${hmac{md5}{SECRET}{${lc:\
                     $sender_address_local_part=$local_part=$domain}}}}\
                   @$sender_address_domain
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">local part</span>&#8221;</span> of the sender address now
        consists of the following components, separated by equal
        signs (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">=</span>&#8221;</span>):
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

        If you need authentication for deliveries to
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">smarthosts</span>&#8221;</span>, add an appropriate

        Add a new router prior to the existing router(s) that
        currently handles your outgoing mail.  This router will use
        the transport above for remote deliveries, but only if the
        file <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.return-path-sign</span>&#8221;</span> exists in the sender's
        home directory, and if the recipient's domain is matched in
        that file.  For instance, if you send mail directly over the
        internet to the final destination:

</p><pre class="screen">
# Sign the envelope sender address (return path) for deliveries to
# remote domains if the sender's home directory contains the file
# ".return-path-sign", and if the remote domain is matched in that
# file. If the file exists, but is empty, the envelope sender
# address is always signed.  
#
dnslookup_signed:
  debug_print   = "R: dnslookup_signed for $local_part@$domain"
  driver        = dnslookup
  transport     = remote_smtp_signed
  senders       = ! : *
  domains       = ! +local_domains : !+relay_to_domains : \
             ${if exists {/home/$sender_address_local_part/.return-path-sign}\
                         {/home/$sender_address_local_part/.return-path-sign}\
                         {!*}}
  no_more
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Or if you use a smarthost:

</p><pre class="screen">
# Sign the envelope sender address (return path) for deliveries to
# remote domains if the sender's home directory contains the file
# ".return-path-sign", and if the remote domain is matched in that

#
smarthost_signed:
  debug_print   = "R: smarthost_signed for $local_part@$domain"
  driver        = manualroute
  transport     = remote_smtp_signed

  no_more  
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Add other options as you see fit
        (e.g. <code class="option">same_domain_copy_routing = yes</code>),
        perhaps modelled after your existing routers.
      </p><p>
        Note that we do not use this router for mails with no envelope
        sender address - we wouldn't want to tamper with those!

        Next, you need to tell Exim that incoming recipient
        addresses that match the format above should be delivered to
        the mailbox identified by the portion before the first equal
        (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">=</span>&#8221;</span>) sign.  For this purpose, you want to
        insert a <code class="option">redirect</code> router early in the
        <code class="option">routers</code> section of your configuration file
        - before any other routers pertaining to local deliveries
        (such as a <span class="emphasis"><em>system alias</em></span> router):
</p><pre class="screen">
hashed_local:
  debug_print       = "R: hashed_local for $local_part@$domain"

  local_part_suffix = =*
  data              = $local_part@$domain
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Recipient addresses that contain a equal sign are rewritten
        such that the portion of the local part that follows the
        equal sign are stripped off.  Then all routers are
        processed again.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="exim-sign-acl"></a>11.4. ACL Signature Check</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The final part of this scheme is to tell Exim that mails
        delivered to valid recipient addresses with this signature
        should <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> be accepted, and that 
        other messages with a NULL envelope sender should be
        rejected if the recipient has opted in to this scheme.
        No greylisting should be done in either case.
      </p><p>
        The following snippet should be placed in <a class="xref" href="exim-final.html#acl_rcpt_to_final" title="14.4. acl_rcpt_to">acl_rcpt_to</a>, prior to any SPF checks,
        greylisting, and/or the final <code class="option">accept</code>
        statement:

</p><pre class="screen">
  # Accept the recipient addresss if it contains our own signature.
  # This means this is a response (DSN, sender callout verification...)
  # to a message that was previously sent from here.
  #
  accept
    domains     = +local_domains
    condition   = ${if and {{match{${lc:$local_part}}{^(.*)=(.*)}}\
                            {eq{${hash_8:${hmac{md5}{SECRET}{$1}}}}{$2}}}\
                           {true}{false}}

  # Otherwise, if this message claims to be a bounce (i.e. if there
  # is no envelope sender), but if the receiver has elected to use
  # and check against envelope sender signatures, reject it.
  #
  deny
    message     = This address does not match a valid, signed \
                  return path from here.\n\
                  You are responding to a forged sender address.
    log_message = bogus bounce.
    senders     = : postmaster@*
    domains     = +local_domains
    set acl_m9  = /home/${extract{1}{=}{${lc:$local_part}}}/.return-path-sign
    condition   = ${if exists {$acl_m9}{true}}

</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        You will have an issue when sending mail to hosts that
        perform callout verification on addresses in the message
        <span class="emphasis"><em>header</em></span>, such as the one provided in the
        <code class="option">From:</code> field of your outgoing mail.  The
        <code class="option">deny</code> statement here will effectively give a
        negative response to such a verification attempt.
      </p><p>
        For that reason, you may want to convert the last
        <code class="option">deny</code> statement into a <code class="option">warn</code>
        statement, store the rejection message in
        <code class="varname">$acl_m0</code>, and perform the actual rejection
        after the <span class="command"><strong>DATA</strong></span> command, in a fashion
        similar to previously described:

</p><pre class="screen">
  # Otherwise, if this message claims to be a bounce (i.e. if there
  # is no envelope sender), but if the receiver has elected to use
  # and check against envelope sender signatures, store a reject
  # message in $acl_m0, and a log message in $acl_m1.  We will later
  # use these to reject the mail.  In the mean time, their presence 
  # indicate that we should keep stalling the sender.
  #
  warn
    senders     = : postmaster@*
    domains     = +local_domains
    set acl_m9  = /home/${extract{1}{=}{${lc:$local_part}}}/.return-path-sign
    condition   = ${if exists {$acl_m9}{true}}
    set acl_m0  = The recipient address &lt;$local_part@$domain&gt; does not \
                  match a valid, signed return path from here.\n\
                  You are responding to a forged sender address.
    set acl_m1  = bogus bounce for &lt;$local_part@$domain&gt;.
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Also, even if the recipient has chosen to use envelope sender
        signatures in their outgoing mail, they may want to exempt
        specific hosts from having to provide this signature in
        incoming mail, even if the mail has no envelope sender
        address.  This may be required for specific mailing list
        servers, see the discussion on <a class="xref" href="collateral.html#signedsender" title="7.3. Enveloper Sender Signature">Envelope Sender Signature</a>
        for details.

                    If you think this is an overkill, would I tend to
                    agree on the surface.  In previous versions of
                    this document, I simply used
                    <code class="option">${hash_8:SECRET=....}</code> to generate
                    the last component of the signature.  However,
                    with this it would be technically possible, with a
                    bit of insight into Exim's
                    <code class="option">${hash...}</code> function and some
                    samples of your outgoing mail sent to different
                    recipients, to forge the signature.  Matthew
