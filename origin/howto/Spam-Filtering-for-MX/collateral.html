      <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#colspam" title="Collateral Spam">Collateral Spam</a> is more difficult to block with the
      techniques described so far, because it normally arrives from
      legitimate sites using standard mail transport software (such as
      Sendmail, Postfix, or Exim).  The challenge is to distinguish
      these messages from valid <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a>s returned in
      response to mail sent from your own users.  Here are some
      ways that people do this:
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bogusviruswarning"></a>7.1. Bogus Virus Warning Filter</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Most of the time, collateral spam is virus warnings generated
	by anti-virus scanners<a href="#ftn.idm1165" class="footnote" name="idm1165"><sup class="footnote">[13]</sup></a>.  In turn,
	the wording in the <code class="option">Subject:</code> line of these
	virus warnings, and/or other characteristics, is usually
	provided by the anti-virus software itself.  As such, you
	could create a list of the more common characteristics, and
	filter out such bogus virus warnings.
      </p><p>
	Well, aren't you in luck - someone already did this for
	you. :-)
      </p><p>
	Tim Jackson <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:tim%20(at)%20timj.co.uk">tim (at) timj.co.uk</a>&gt;</code> maintains a
	list of bogus virus warnings for use with <a class="link" href="datachecks.html#spamassassin">SpamAssassin</a>.  This list is
	available at:
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.timj.co.uk/linux/bogus-virus-warnings.cf" target="_top">http://www.timj.co.uk/linux/bogus-virus-warnings.cf</a>.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="addspf"></a>7.2. Publish SPF info for your domain</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The purpose of the <a class="xref" href="senderauth.html#spf" title="5.1. Sender Policy Framework (SPF)">Sender Policy Framework</a> is precisely to
	protect against <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#joejob" title="Joe Job">Joe Job</a>s; i.e. to prevent
	forgeries of valid e-mail addresses.
      </p><p>
	If you publish SPF records in the DNS zone for your domain,
	then recipient hosts that incorporate SPF checks would not
	have accepted the forged message in the first place.  As such,
	they would not be sending a <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a> to your
	site.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="signedsender"></a>7.3. Enveloper Sender Signature</h3></div></div></div><p>
	A different approach that I am currently experimenting with
	myself is to add a signature in the local part of the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a> address in outgoing mail, then check for
	this signature in the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envto" title="Envelope Recipient">Envelope Recipient</a> address before
	accepting incoming <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#dsn" title="Delivery Status Notification">Delivery Status Notification</a>s.  For instance, the
	generated sender address might be of the following format:
	</p><pre class="screen"><em class="parameter"><code>localpart</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>signature</code></em>@<em class="parameter"><code>domain</code></em></pre><p>
      </p><p>
	Normal message replies are unaffected.  These replies go to
	the address in the <code class="option">From:</code> or
	<code class="option">Reply-To:</code> field of the message, which are
	left intact.
      </p><p>
	Sounds easy, doesn't it?  Unfortunately, generating a
	signature that is suitable for this purpose is a bit more
	complex than it sounds.  There are a couple of conflicting
	considerations to take into account:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    To gain any benefit from this method, the signed envelope
	    sender address that you generate should be useless in the
	    hands of spammers.  Typically, this would imply that the
	    signature incorporates a time stamp that would eventually
	    expire:

	    </p><pre class="screen"><em class="parameter"><code>sender</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>timestamp</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>hash</code></em>@<em class="parameter"><code>domain</code></em></pre><p>
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    If you send mail to a site that incorporates <a class="xref" href="greylisting.html" title="4. Greylisting">Greylisting</a>, your envelope sender address
	    should remain constant for that particular recipient.
	    Otherwise, your mail will continuously be greylisted.
	  </p><p>
	    With this in mind, you could generate a <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a> based on the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envto" title="Envelope Recipient">Envelope Recipient</a>
	    address:

	    </p><pre class="screen"><em class="parameter"><code>sender</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>recipient</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>recipient.domain</code></em>=<em class="parameter"><code>hash</code></em>@<em class="parameter"><code>domain</code></em></pre><p>

	    Although this address does not expire, if you start seeing
	    junk mail to it, you will at least know the source of the
	    leak - it is incorported in the recipient address.
	    Moreover, you can easily block specific recipient address
	    signatures, without affecting normal mail delivery to that
	    same recipient.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Two more issues occur with mailing list servers.  Usually,
	    replies to request mails (such as
	    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">subscribe</span>&#8221;</span>/<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unsubscribe</span>&#8221;</span>) are
	    sent with no envelope sender.
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
		The first issue pertains to servers that send
		responses back to the <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#envfrom" title="Envelope Sender">Envelope Sender</a>
		address of the request mail (as in the case of
		<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:discuss@en.tldp.org">discuss@en.tldp.org</a>&gt;</code>).  The problem is
		that commands for the mailing list server (such as
		<span class="command"><strong>subscribe</strong></span> or
		<span class="command"><strong>unsubscribe</strong></span>) are typically sent to
		one or more different addresses
		(e.g. <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org">discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org</a>&gt;</code> and
		<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org">discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org</a>&gt;</code>,
		respectively) than the address used for list mail.
		Hence, the subscriber address will be different from
		the sender address in messages sent to the list itself
		-- and in this example, also different from the
		address that will be generated for unsubscription
		requests.  As a result, you may not be able to post to
		the list, or unsubscribe.
	      </p><p>
		The compromise would be to incorporate only the
		recipient <span class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span> in the sender
		signature.  The sender address might then look like:
		</p><pre class="screen"><em class="parameter"><code>subscribername</code></em>=en.tldp.org=<em class="parameter"><code>hash</code></em>@<em class="parameter"><code>subscriber.domain</code></em></pre><p>
	      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		The second issue pertains to those that send responses
		back to the reply address in the message header of the
		request mail (such as
		<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:spam-l-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com">spam-l-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com</a>&gt;</code>).
		Since this address is not signed, the response from
		the list server would be blocked by your server.
	      </p><p>
		There is not much you can do about this, other than to
		<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">whitelist</span>&#8221;</span> these particular servers in
		such a way that they are allowed to return mail to
		unsigned recipient addresses.
	      </p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>
	At this point, this approach starts losing some of its edge.
	Moreover, even legitimate DSNs are rejected unless the
	original mail has been sent via your server.  Thus, you should
	only consider doing this if for those of your users that do
	not roam, or otherwise send their outgoing mail via servers
	outside your control.
      </p><p>
	That said, in situations where none of the above concerns
	apply to you, this method gives you a good way to not only
	eliminate collateral spam, but also a way to educate the
	owners of the sites that (presumably unwittingly) generate it.
	Moreover, as a side benefit, sites that perform <a class="xref" href="smtpchecks.html#callback" title="3.2.4. Sender Callout Verification">Sender Callout Verification</a> will only get a positive response from
	you if the original mail was, indeed, sent from your site.  In
	essence, you are reducing your exposure to sender address
	forgeries by spammers.
      </p><p>
	You could perhaps allow your users to specify whether to sign
	outgoing mails, and if so, specify which hosts should be
	allowed to return mails to the unsigned version of their
	address.  For instance, if they have system accounts on your
	mail server, you could check for the existence and content,
	respectively, of a given file in their home directory.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dsnrealuser"></a>7.4. Accept Bounces Only for Real Users</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Even if you check for envelope sender signatures, there may be
	a loophole that allows bogus bounces to be accepted.
	Specifically, if your users have to opt in to the scheme, you
	are probably not checking for this signature in mails sent to
	system aliases, such as <code class="option">postmaster</code> or
	<code class="option">mailer-daemon</code>.  Moreover, since these users
	do not generate outgoing mail, they should not receive any
	bounces.
      </p><p>
	You can reject mail if it is sent to such system aliases, or
	alternatively, if there is no mailbox for the provided
	recipient address.
