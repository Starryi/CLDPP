	  A filter that assigns a probability of spam based on the
	  recurrence of words (or, more recently, word
	  constellations/phrases) between messages.
	</p><p>
	  You initially train the filter by feeding it known junk mail
	  (spam) and known legitimate mail (ham).  A bayesian score
	  is then be assigned to each word (or phrase) in each
	  message, indicating whether this particular word or phrase
	  occurs most commonly in ham or in spam.  The word, along
	  with its score, is stored in a <span class="emphasis"><em>bayesian
	  index</em></span>.
	</p><p>
	  Such filters may catch indicators that may be missed by
	  human programmers trying to manually create keyword-based
	  filters.  At the very least, they automate this task.
	</p><p>
	  Bayesian word indexes are most certainly specific to the
	  language in which they received training.  Moreover, they are
	  specific to individual users.  Thus, they are perhaps more
	  suitable for individual content filters (e.g. in <a class="xref" href="gloss.html#mua" title="Mail User Agent">Mail User Agent</a>s) than they are for system-wide, SMTP-time
	  filtering.
	</p><p>
	  Moreover, spammers have developed techniques to defeat
	  simple bayesian filters, by including random dictionary
	  words and/or short stories in their messages.  This
	  decreases the spam probability assigned by a baynesian
	  filter, and in the long run, degrades the quality of the
	  bayesian index.

	  (<span class="emphasis"><em>abbrev: DNS</em></span>) The de-facto standard for
	  obtaining information about internet domain names.  Examples
	  of such information include IP addresses of its servers
	  (so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>A records</em></span>), the dedication
	  of incoming mail exchangers (MX records), generic server
	  information (SRV records), and miscellaneous text
	  information (TXT records).
	</p><p>
	  DNS is a hierarctical, distributed system; each domain name
	  is associated with a set of one or more DNS servers that
	  provide information about that domain - including delegation
	  of name service for its subdomains.
	</p><p>
	  For instance, the top-level domain <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">org</span>&#8221;</span> is
	  operated by The Public Interest Registry; its DNS servers
	  delegate queries for the domain name <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tldp.org</span>&#8221;</span>
	  to specific name servers for The Linux Documentation
	  Project.  In turn, TLDPs name server (actually operated by
	  UNC) may or may not delegate queries for third-level names,
	  such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">www.tldp.org</span>&#8221;</span>.
	</p><p>
	  DNS lookups are usually performed by forwarding name
	  servers, such as those provided by an Internet Service

	  temporary or permanent problem, and/or whether or not and
	  for how long delivery attempts will continue.
