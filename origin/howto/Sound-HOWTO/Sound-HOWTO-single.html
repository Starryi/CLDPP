>2. Sound Card Technology</A
></H2
><P
>This section gives a <EM
>very</EM
> cursory overview of
computer audio technology, in order to help you understand
the concepts used later in the document. You should consult a book on
digital audio or digital signal processing in order to learn more.</P
><P
>Sound is an <EM
>analog</EM
> property; it can take on any value over a
continuous range. Computers are <EM
>digital</EM
>; they like to work
with discrete values. Sound cards use a device known as an <EM
>Analog
to Digital Converter</EM
> (A/D or ADC) to convert voltages
corresponding to analog sound waves into digital or numeric values
which can be stored in memory. Similarly, a <EM
>Digital to Analog
Converter</EM
> (D/A or DAC) converts numeric values back to an analog
voltage which can in turn drive a loudspeaker, producing sound.</P
><P
>The process of analog to digital conversion, known as
sampling, introduces some error. Two factors are key in determining
how well the sampled signal represents the original. <EM
>Sampling
rate</EM
> is the number of samples made per unit of time (usually
expresses as samples per second or Hertz). A low sampling
rate will provide a less accurate representation of the analog
signal. Sample size is the range of values used to represent each
sample, usually expressed in bits. The larger the sample size, the
more accurate the digitized signal will be.</P
><P
>Sound cards commonly use 8 or 16 bit samples at sampling rates from
about 4000 to 44,000 samples per second. The samples may also be
contain one channel (mono) or two (stereo).</P
><P
><EM
>FM Synthesis</EM
> is an older technique for producing
sound. It is based on combining different waveforms (e.g. sine,
triangle, square). FM synthesis is simpler to implement in
hardware that D/A conversion, but is more difficult to program and
less flexible. Many sound cards provide FM synthesis for backward
compatibility with older cards and software. Several independent sound
generators or <EM
>voices</EM
> are usually provided.</P
><P
><EM
>Wavetable Synthesis</EM
> combines the flexibility of
D/A conversion with the multiple channel capability of FM
synthesis. With this scheme digitized voices can be downloaded into
dedicated memory, and then played, combined, and modified with little
CPU overhead. State of the art sound cards all support wavetable
synthesis.</P
><P
>Most sound cards provide the capability of <EM
>mixing</EM
>, combining
signals from different input sources and controlling gain levels.</P
><P
><EM
>MIDI</EM
> stands for Musical Instrument Digital
Interface, and is a standard hardware and software protocol for
allowing musical instruments to communicate with each other. The
events sent over a MIDI bus can also be stored as MIDI files for later
editing and playback. Many sound cards provide a MIDI interface. Those
that do not can still play MIDI files using the on-board capabilities
of the sound card.</P
><P
><EM
>MOD files</EM
> are a common format for computer
generated songs. As well as information about the musical notes to be
played, the files contain digitized samples for the instruments (or
voices). MOD files originated on the Amiga computer, but can be played
on other systems, including Linux, with suitable software.</P
><P
><EM
>MP3 files</EM
> are a popular format for distributing
computer music and speech. MP3 uses a sophisticated encoding scheme
(MPEG layer 3) to compress audio by roughly a factor of 10 with little
reduction in quality as compared to CD audio.</P

currently supported under Linux. The information here is based on the
latest Linux kernel, which at time of writing was version 2.4.4. This
document only applies to the sound drivers included with the standard
Linux kernel source distribution. There are other sound drivers
available for Linux (see the later section entitled Alternate Sound
Drivers).</P

></H3
><P
>The information in this HOWTO is valid for Linux on the Intel
x86 platform.</P
><P
>The sound driver should also work with most sound cards on the
Alpha platform. However, some cards may conflict with I/O
ports of other devices on Alpha systems even though they work
perfectly on i386 machines, so in general it's not possible to tell if
a given card will work or not without actually trying it.</P
><P
>Users have reported that the sound driver was not yet working on the
PowerPC version of Linux, but it should be supported in
future.</P
><P
>Sound can be configured into the kernel under the MIPs port
of Linux, and some MIPs machines have EISA slots and/or built in sound
hardware. I'm told the Linux-MIPs group is interested in adding sound
support in the future.</P
><P
>The Linux kernel includes a separate driver for the Atari
and Amiga versions of Linux that implements a compatible
subset of the sound driver on the Intel platform using the built-in
sound hardware on these machines.</P
><P
>The SPARC port of Linux currently has sound support for
some models of Sun workstations. I've been told that the on-board
sound hardware works but the external DSP audio box is not supported
because Sun has not released the specifications for it.</P

>3.2. Sound Card Types</A
></H3
><P
>A number of different types of sound cards exist, reflecting the
different bus architectures available. Here is a brief overview of the
more common types and their distinguishing features.</P
><P
><EM
>ISA bus</EM
> cards are among the oldest sound cards
using the original (non Plug and Play) ISA bus. These typically use
jumpers to select hardware settings for I/O addresses, IRQ, and DMA
channel. You are unlikely to find any of this type manufactured today.</P
><P
><EM
>ISA Plug and Play</EM
> cards use the extended version
of the ISA bus that supports software identification and configuration
of card settings. Few of these, if any, are still being manufactured.</P
><P
><EM
>PCI bus</EM
> cards use the higher bandwidth PCI bus
which provides identification and configuration of cards in
software. The majority of sound cards manufactured today now use
PCI. Most motherboards that provide on-board sound hardware also make
use of the PCI bus.</P
><P
><EM
>USB</EM
> is a newer bus architecture for external
hot-pluggable devices. In theory USB bus sound cards could be
developed, but I am only aware of USB-bus speakers being sold
currently.</P

><P
>The following sound cards are supported by the Linux kernel
sound driver. Some of the items listed are audio chip sets rather than
models of sound cards. The list is incomplete because there are many
sound cards compatible with these that will work under Linux. To add
further to the confusion, some manufacturers periodically change the
design of their cards causing incompatibilities and continue to sell
them as the same model.

>A word about compatibility: even though most sound cards are claimed
to be <EM
>SoundBlaster compatible</EM
>, very few currently sold cards are
compatible enough to work with the Linux SoundBlaster driver. These
cards usually work better using the MSS/WSS or MAD16 driver. Only real
SoundBlaster cards made by Creative Labs, which use Creative's custom
chips (e.g. SoundBlaster16 Vibra), MV Jazz16 and ESS688/1688 based
cards generally work with the SoundBlaster driver. Trying to use a
SoundBlaster Pro compatible 16 bit sound card with the SoundBlaster
driver is usually just a waste of time.</P

>Sound support in the Linux kernel was originally written by Hannu
Savolainen. Hannu then went on to develop the Open Sound system, a
commercial set of sound drivers sold by 4Front Technologies that is
supported on a number of Unix systems. Red Hat Software sponsored Alan
Cox to enhance the kernel sound drivers to make them fully
modular. Various other people also contributed bug fixes and developed
additional drivers for new sound cards. These modified drivers were
shipped by Red Hat in their 5.0 through 5.2 releases. These changes
have now been integrated into the standard kernel as of version
2.0. Alan Cox is now the maintainer of the standard kernel sound
drivers, although Hannu still periodically contributes code taken from
the commercial driver.</P
><P
>The commercial Open Sound System driver from 4Front Technologies tends
to be easier to configure and support more sound cards, particularly
the newer models. It is also compatible with applications written for
the standard kernel sound drivers. The disadvantage is that you need
to pay for it, and you do not get source code. You can download a free
evaluation copy of the product before deciding whether to purchase it.

Linux Sound Architecture</EM
> (ALSA) and has resulted in what they
believe is a more generally usable sound driver that can be used as a
replacement for the built-in kernel drivers. The ALSA drivers support
a number of popular sound cards, are full duplex, fully modularized,

><P
>Choose settings for the sound card that do not conflict with
any other devices in your system and uncomment the appropriate lines
in <TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

up, normally done by one of the startup scripts. Reboot your system or
run <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

> manually.&#13;</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>If for some reason you cannot or do not wish to use the isapnp tools,
there are a couple of other options. If you use the card under
Microsoft Windows 95 or 98, you can use the device manager to set up
the card, then soft boot into Linux using the LOADLIN program. Make
sure Windows and Linux use the same card setup parameters.</P

cards to configure it under DOS, then soft boot into Linux using the
LOADLIN program. Again, make sure DOS and Linux use the same card
setup parameters.</P
><P

configuring the cards without the isapnp tools. Check the

>&#13;You need the appropriate device drivers for your sound card to be
present in the kernel. The kernel running on your system may already
include the drivers for your sound card. In most cases the drivers
would have been built as kernel loadable modules. You can check which
drivers are available as modules by looking in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules</TT

the sound drivers would normally appear in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

see the driver(s) for your sound card, you can try using the module
directory and skip recompiling the kernel.</P
><P
>If the sound drivers are not already built, you will need to configure
and build a new kernel. You can either build the sound drivers into
the kernel or build them as kernel loadable modules. In most cases
building as modules is preferred, as it allows you to easily
experiment with loading different drivers if unsure which one to use
and the drivers can be unloaded when not needed, freeing up memory.
Building the drivers into the kernel itself may be desirable if you
are unfamiliar with kernel modules and want a simpler solution.</P
><P
>The <A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Kernel HOWTO</A
>
should be consulted for the details of building a kernel. I will just
mention here some issues that are specific to sound cards.</P
><P
>If you have never configured the kernel for sound support before it is
a good idea to read the relevant documentation included with the
kernel sound drivers, particularly information specific to your card
type. The files can be found in the kernel documentation directory,
usually installed in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sound</TT
>.
If this directory is missing you likely either have a very old kernel
version or you have not installed the kernel source code.</P
><P
>Follow the usual procedure for building the kernel. There are
currently three interfaces to the configuration process. A graphical
user interface that runs under X11 can be invoked using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make
xconfig</TT
>. A menu-based system that only requires text displays is
available as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make menuconfig</TT
>. The original method, using
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make config</TT
>, offers a simple text-based interface.</P
><P
>When configuring the kernel there will be many choices for selecting
the type of sound card you have and the driver options to use.
The on-line help within the configuration tool should provide
an explanation of what each option is for. Select the appropriate
options to the best of your knowledge.</P

kernel as per the Kernel HOWTO.</P

><P
>If the above commands return "I/O error", you should look at the
end of the kernel messages listed using the "dmesg" command. It's
likely that an error message is printed there. Very often the message
is "Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?". The above
message means that the driver didn't get the expected interrupt from
the sound card. In most cases it means that the IRQ or the DMA channel
configured to the driver doesn't work. The best way to get it working
is to try with all possible DMAs and IRQs supported by the device.</P
><P
>Another possible reason is that the device is not compatible with the
device the driver is configured for. This is almost certainly the case
when a supposedly "SoundBlaster (Pro/16) compatible" sound card
doesn't work with the SoundBlaster driver. In this case you should try
to find out the device your sound card is compatible with (by posting
to the comp.os.linux.hardware newsgroup, for example).</P

channel 1 there is a potential conflict with the QIC-02 tape driver,
which also uses DMA 1, causing "device busy" errors. If you are using

the QIC-02 driver is not essential for the use of FTAPE; only the
QIC-117 driver is required. Reconfiguring the kernel to use QIC-117

>Playing MOD files, however, requires considerable CPU resources. Some
experimental measurements have shown that playing at 44kHz requires
more than 40% of the speed of a 486/50 and a 386/25 can hardly play
faster than 22 kHz (these are with an 8 bit card sound such as a
SoundBlaster). A card such as the Gravis UltraSound card performs more
functions in hardware, and will require less CPU resources.</P

></H3
><P
>(the following explanation was supplied by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>seeker@indirect.com</TT
>)</P
><P
>Linux only recognizes the 1542 at address 330 (default) or 334, and
the PAS only allows the MPU-401 emulation at 330. Even when you
disable the MPU-401 under software, something still wants to conflict
with the 1542 if it's at its preferred default address. Moving the
1542 to 334 makes everyone happy.</P
><P
>Additionally, both the 1542 and the PAS-16 do 16-bit DMA, so if you
sample at 16-bit 44 KHz stereo and save the file to a SCSI drive hung
on the 1542, you're about to have trouble. The DMAs overlap and there
isn't enough time for RAM refresh, so you get the dread ``PARITY ERROR
- SYSTEM HALTED'' message, with no clue to what caused it. It's made
worse because a few second-party vendors with QIC-117 tape drives
recommend setting the bus on/off times such that the 1542 is on even
longer than normal. Get the SCSISEL.EXE program from Adaptec's BBS or
several places on the internet, and reduce the BUS ON time or increase
the BUS OFF time until the problem goes away, then move it one notch
or more further. SCSISEL changes the EEPROM settings, so it's more
permanent than a patch to the DOS driver line in CONFIG.SYS, and will
work if you boot right into Linux (unlike the DOS patch). Next
problem solved.</P
><P
>Last problem - the older Symphony chipsets drastically reduced the
timing of the I/O cycles to speed up bus accesses. None of various
boards I've played with had <EM
>any</EM
> problem with the reduced
timing except for the PAS-16. Media Vision's BBS has SYMPFIX.EXE
that's supposed to cure the problem by twiddling a diagnostic bit in
Symphony's bus controller, but it's not a hard guarantee. You may
need to:</P

></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>Young Microsystems will upgrade the boards they import for around
$30 (US); other vendors may be similar if you can figure out
who made or imported the motherboard (good luck). The problem is in
ProAudio's bus interface chip as far as I'm concerned; <EM
>nobody</EM
>
buys a $120 sound card and sticks it in a 6MHz AT. Most of
them wind up in 25-40MHz 386/486 boxes, and should be able to handle
<EM
>at least</EM
> 12MHz bus rates if the chips are designed
right. Exit soapbox (stage left).</P
><P
>The first problem depends on the chipset used on your motherboard,
what bus speed and other BIOS settings, and the phase of the moon.
The second problem depends on your refresh option setting (hidden or
synchronous), the 1542 DMA rate and (possibly) the bus I/O rate. The
third can be determined by calling Media Vision and asking which
flavor of Symphony chip is incompatible with their slow design. Be
warned, though - 3 of 4 techs I talked to were brain damaged. I would
be very leery of trusting <EM
