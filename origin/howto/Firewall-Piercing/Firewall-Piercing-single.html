an ancient and no-more-supported program named <SPAN

(a great program in its time,
and maybe still useful in some unhappy circumstances),
as well as on peculiarities of a not-so-standard telnet implementation,
that is, many obsolete and non-portable facts.
Nevertheless, there was a necessity for a mini-HOWTO about piercing firewalls,
and despite the limitations of its hacks,
this mini-HOWTO was a model and an encouragement.</P

></H3
><P
>This document has a moral. And the moral is:
<EM
>a firewall cannot protect a network against its own internal users,
and should not even try to.</EM
></P
><P
>When an internal user asks you system administrator
to open an outbound port to an external machine,
or an inbound port to an internal machine,
then you should do it for him.
Of course you should help the user to make sure
that his transactions are secure, and that his software is robust.
But a flat out denial of service is plain incompetence.
For unless he is so firewalled as to be completely cut from the outside world,
with no <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>, no <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>,
no web browsing, no email, no dns, no <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ping</B
>,
no phone line, no radio, no nothing,
then the user can and will use firewall piercing techniques to access
the machines he wants nonetheless,
and the net result for security will be
an unaudited connection with the outside world.
So either you trust your users, after proper training and selection,
or you shouldn't grant them access to the network at all - but then again,
the role of a network administrator is usually to serve its users,
so your goal should be the former rather than the latter.
You can and you shall protect them from the outside world;
you can and you shall protect your critical services from them;
but you can't and you shall not protect them from themselves.</P
><P
>Because there exists such things as system administrators
who are either unresponsive, absent, overworked, plain incompetent,
irresponsible, or more generally managed by incompetent people,
it so happens that a user may find himself behind a firewall
that he may cross, but only in awkward ways.
This mini-HOWTO explains a generic and portable way
to pierce tunnels into firewalls,
by turning any thin, tiny trickle of bits
into a full-fledged information superhighway,
so the user can seamlessly use standard tools to access computers
on the other side of the firewall.
The very same technique can be used by competent system administrators
to build virtual private networks (VPN).</P

>2.2. Security issues</A
></H3
><P
>Of course, if your sysadm has setup a firewall
s/he might have a good reason,
and you may have signed an agreement to not circumvent it.
On the other hand, the fact that you can use
telnet, the web, e-mail, or whatever other bidirectional information flux
with the outside of the firewall
(which is a prerequisite for the presented hacks to work)
means that you are allowed to access external systems,
and the fact that you can log into a particular external system
somehow means you're allowed to do it, too.</P
><P
>So this is all a matter of <EM
>conveniently</EM
>
using legal holes in a firewall,
and allow generic programs to work from there with generic protocols,
as opposed to requiring special or modified (and recompiled) programs
going through lots of special-purpose proxies
that be misconfigured by an uncaring or incompetent sysadm,
or to installing lots of special-purpose converters
to access each of your usual services (like e-mail)
through ways supported by the firewall (like the web).</P
><P
>Moreover, the use of a user-level IP emulator such as
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SLiRP</SPAN
>
should still prevent external attackers from piercing the firewall back
in the other way, unless explicitly permitted by you
(or they are clever and wicked,
and root or otherwise able to spy you on the server host).</P
><P
>All in all, the presented hack should be <EM
>relatively</EM
> safe.
However, it all depends on the particular circumstances
in which you set things up,
and I can give no guarantee about this hack.
Lots of things are intrinsically unsafe
about any Internet connection, be it with this hack or not,
so don't you assume anything is safe unless you have good reasons,
and/or use some kind of encryption all the way.</P
><P
>Let's repeat the basics of networking security:
<EM
>you cannot trust anything about a connection
more than you trust the hosts that can handle the unencrypted data</EM
>,
including hosts on both ends of the connection,
and all hosts that can intercept the communication,
unless the communication is properly encrypted with secret keys.
If you misplace your trust,
your passwords may be stolen and used against you,
your credit card number may be stolen and used against you,
and you may be fired from your work for endangering the whole company.
Tough nuggies.</P

describes how to use <SPAN

><P
>If you want this hack to work for you,
you'll have to get an idea of how it works,
so that in case anything breaks,
you know where to look for.</P
><P
>The first step toward understanding the problem
is to give a name to relevant concepts.</P
><P
>As usual, we'll herein call "client" the machine
that decides to initiate the connection,
as well as programs and files on that machine.
Conversely, we'll call "server" that waits for connections and accepts them,
as well as programs and files on that machine.
Firewall piercing is useful when the two machines are separated by a firewall,
such that it is possible for the server to accept some kind of connections,
whereas the client might or might not be able to accept any.
A tunnel will be created between the two machines
that allows full IP traffic despite the firewall.</P
><P
>Usually, when piercing firewalls, the client is the machine behind a firewall:
it has limited access to the internet,
but can somehow open some kind of connection to the server.
The server is a machine with full internet access,
that will serve as a proxy for the client to access all of the internet.
In a VPN, the firewall the roles might be reversed,
with the client being on the internet, and
the server serving as a proxy for the client to access some private network.</P

></H3
><P
>The main problem with firewall piercing is to create a tunnel:
a continuous connection from the client machine
to a server machine on the other side of the firewall,
that allows for bidirectional exchange of information.
Optionally, this connection should be a secure one.
The secondary problem is to transform this connection
into a full IP access for normal programs to use transparently.</P
><P
>For the main problem, we'll assume that
either (1) you can establish normal TCP/IP connections
from the client side of the firewall to some port on a server machine
where a sshd runs or can be set to run, or
(2) you can somehow establish a telnet connection through a telnet proxy.
In case you cannot, we will give you pointers
to other software that allows you
to pierce a tunnel accross a firewall.
Although we only give a secure solution in the first case,
you can hack your own secure solution in the other cases,
if you understand the principle
(if you don't, someone, e.g. I, can do it for you in exchange for money).</P

><P
>Although this is conceptually trivial,
it nonetheless requires a few silly tricks, so as to work, since
(a) in case you're using some kind of programmed interactive shell session
to start the server's IP emulator on either side, you need to correctly
synchronize the start of the IP emulator on the other side,
so as not to send garbage into the shell session,
and
(b) IP emulators are designed to be run on a "tty" interface
so you have to convert your tunnel's interface into a tty one.</P

and doesn't even exist if you use <B

>The catch is that although your network administration would tell you
to setup your some router on your client side's as the default route,
(this may be relevant if you want to have a specific route
to the networks on the client of the firewall),
you should setup PPP link as the route to the networks on the server side.</P
><P
>In other words, your default route should point to a router
on whichever side of the tunnel that gives you access to the Internet.</P
><P
>Most importantly, packets sent to the server host as part of running the tunnel
should be routed through your usual network
(e.g. your default ethernet router);
otherwise, your kernel will have problems,
as it tries to route through the inside the tunnel
the very packets that ought to constitute the outside of the tunnel.</P
><P
>Thus, you'll have to setup correct routes
in your network startup configuration.
The precise location of your routing configuration data
depends on your distribution, but it is typically
under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/init.d/network</TT
>
or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/network/</TT

similarly, your PPP configuration is typically
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

and the proper place to configure its routes is usually
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ip-up</TT

you must read the documentation of your distribution and otherwise

alternatively use <B

gives the current route to the server host that is the other end of the tunnel.</P

>Once you can route packets to the server side of the tunnel,
you might want to setup your machine as a router for all your pals

This is not specific to Firewall-Piercing, so just you read
the relevant HOWTOs about networking, routing and masquerading.
Also, for security reasons, be sure to also setup
a proper firewall on your machine,

CLASS="COMMAND"
>procmail</B
>
at delivery.
Note that if you run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fetchmail</B
> as a background daemon,
it will lock away any other fetchmail that you'd like to run
only at other times, like when you open a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
>;
of course, if you can also run a fetchmail daemon as a fake user.
Too frequent a poll won't be nice to either the mailserver or your host.
Too infrequent a poll means you'll have to wait before the message gets read
and the reverse connection gets established.
I use two-minute poll frequency.</P

>I have no idea how to pierce firewalls with lesser operating systems,
but you can take one of these old disused computers
(about anything with 8MB of RAM and an ethernet card should do),
install Linux or BSD as on it, and pierce the firewall with it,
while serving as a router for other machines running lesser OSes.
See appropriate HOWTOs about routing, IP forwarding, NAT, etc.</P
><P
>I don't know the details, but a promising tool to pierce firewalls is
Chris Mason's <A
HREF="http://www.r00t3d.org.uk/"
TARGET="_top"
>Bouncer</A

which acts as a SOCKS-proxy-over-SSL.</P
><P
>There are other kinds of firewalls
than those that allow for direct ssh or telnet connections.
As long as a continuous flow of packets
may transmit information through a firewall in both directions,
it is possible to pierce it;
only the price of writing the piercer may be higher or lower.</P
><P
>In a very easy case, we saw that you can just launch <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
over a pty master and do some <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> in the slave tty.
You may even want to do it without an adverse firewall,
just so as to build a secure ``VPN'' (Virtual Private Network).
The <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/VPN.html"
TARGET="_top"
>VPN mini-HOWTO</A
>
gives all the details you need about this.
We invite you, as an exercise,
to modify <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
>
so as to use this technique,
or perhaps even so as to use it
inside a previous non-secure <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
> session.</P
><P
>Now, if the only way through the firewall is a WWW proxy
(usually, a minimum for an Internet-connected network),
you might want to use
<A
HREF="http://www.snurgle.org/~griffon/"

script
<A
HREF="http://www.snurgle.org/~griffon/ssh-https-tunnel"

>ssh-https-tunnel</A

><P
>Another promising program for piercing through HTTP is
<A
HREF="http://lars.nocrew.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>Lars Brinkoff</A
>'s
<A
HREF="http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel/"
TARGET="_top"
>httptunnel</A
>,
a http server and client combination that achieves a TCP/IP tunnel connection
through the proxy-friendly HTTP protocol.
You should then be able to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
>
(preferably over <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>)
over that connection, although I haven't tried it yet.
Could anyone test and report?
Note that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>httptunnel</B
> is still under development,
so you may help implement
the features it currently lacks,
like, having multiple connections, and/or serving fake pages
so as to mislead suspicious adverse firewall administrators.</P
><P
>Whatever goes through your firewall,
be it telnet, HTTP or other TCP/IP connections,
or something real weird like DNS queries, ICMP packets, e-mail
(see <A
HREF="http://www.detached.net/mailtunnel/"
TARGET="_top"
>mailtunnel</A
>,
<A
HREF="http://www.detached.net/icmptunnel/"
TARGET="_top"
>icmptunnel</A
>),
or whatelse,
you can always write a tunnel client/server combination,
and run a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> and/or PPP connection through it.
The performance mightn't be high,
depending on the effective information communication rate
after paying the overhead for coding around filters and proxies;
but such a tunnel is still interesting as long as it's good enough
to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fetchmail</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>suck</B
>,
and other non-interactive programs.</P
><P
>If you need cross a 7-bit line, you'll want to use SLIP instead of PPP.
I never tried, because lines are more or less 8-bit clean these days,
but it shouldn't be difficult.
If necessary, fall back to using the
<A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Term-Firewall.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Term-Firewall mini-HOWTO</A
>.</P
><P
>If you have an 8-bit clean connection and you're root on linux both sides
of the firewall, you might want to use ethertap for better performance,
encapsulating raw ethernet communications on top of your connection.
David Madore has written ethertap-over-TCP and ethertap-over-UDP tunneling
<A
HREF="ftp://quatramaran.ens.fr/pub/madore/misc/"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://quatramaran.ens.fr/pub/madore/misc/</A
>.
There remains to write some ethertap-over-tty to combine with fwprc-like tools.</P
><P
>If you really need more performance than you can get
while paying for a user-space sequential communication tunnel
through which to run PPP,
then you're in the very hard case
where you might have to re-hack a weird IP stack,
using (for instance) the Fox project's packet-protocol functors.
You'll then achieve some direct IP-over-HTTP, IP-over-DNS, IP-over-ICMP,
or such, which requires not only an elaborate protocol,
but also an interface to an OS kernel, both of which are costly to implement.</P
><P
>Finally, if you're not fighting against an adverse firewall,
but just building your own VPN, there is a large offer of VPN tools,
and although the tricks I present are simple, work well,
and might be enough for your needs, it could be a good idea
to look at this evolving offer (that I do not know much about)
for a solution that fits your requirements of performance and maintainability.</P
