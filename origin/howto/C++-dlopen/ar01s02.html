      functions) at runtime; this happens most often when you are
      writing some kind of plug-in or module architecture for your
      program.</p><p>In the C language, loading a library is very simple (calling
      <code class="function">dlopen</code>, <code class="function">dlsym</code> and
      <code class="function">dlclose</code> is enough), with C++ this is a bit
      more complicated.  The difficulties of loading a C++ library
      dynamically are partially due to <a class="link" href="ar01s02.html#mangling" title="2.1. Name Mangling">name
      mangling</a>, and partially due to the fact that the
      <code class="function">dlopen</code> API was written with C in mind, thus
      not offering a suitable way to load classes.</p><p>Before explaining how to load libraries in C++, let's better
      analyze the problem by looking at name mangling in more
      detail. I recommend you read the explanation of name mangling,
      even if you're not interested in it because it will help you
      understanding why problems occur and how to solve them.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mangling"></a>2.1. Name Mangling</h3></div></div></div><p>In every C++ program (or library, or object file), all
        non-static functions are represented in the binary file as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>symbols</em></span>. These symbols are special text
        strings that uniquely identify a function in the program,
        library, or object file.</p><p>In C, the symbol name is the same as the function name:
        the symbol of <code class="function">strcpy</code> will be
        <code class="computeroutput">strcpy</code>, and so on. This is
        possible because in C no two non-static functions can have the
        same name.</p><p>Because C++ allows overloading (different functions with
        the same name but different arguments) and has many features C
        does not &#8212; like classes, member functions, exception
        specifications &#8212; it is not possible to simply use the
        function name as the symbol name.  To solve that, C++ uses
        so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>name mangling</em></span>, which transforms
        the function name and all the necessary information (like the
        number and size of the arguments) into some weird-looking
        string which only the compiler knows about.  The mangled name
        of <code class="function">foo</code> might look like
        <code class="computeroutput">foo@4%6^</code>, for example.  Or it
        might not even contain the word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">foo</span>&#8221;</span>.</p><p> One of the problems with name mangling is that the C++
        standard (currently [<span class="citation">ISO14882</span>]) does not
        define how names have to be mangled; thus every compiler
        mangles names in its own way. Some compilers even change their
        name mangling algorithm between different versions (notably
        g++ 2.x and 3.x).  Even if you worked out how your particular
        compiler mangles names (and would thus be able to load
        functions via <code class="function">dlsym</code>), this would most
        probably work with your compiler only, and might already be
        broken with the next version.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm137"></a>2.2. Classes</h3></div></div></div><p>Another problem with the <code class="function">dlopen</code> API
        is the fact that it only supports loading
        <span class="emphasis"><em>functions</em></span>. But in C++ a library often
        exposes a class which you would like to use in your
        program. Obviously, to use that class you need to create an
        instance of it, but that cannot be easily done.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1. Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. The Solution</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
