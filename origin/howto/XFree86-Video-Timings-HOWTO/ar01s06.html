hacking an Xconfig entry.  These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>your monitor's horizontal and vertical sync frequency options</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>your monitor's bandwidth</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>your video adapter's driving clock frequencies, or "dot clocks"</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm140"></a>6.1. The monitor sync frequencies</h3></div></div></div><p>The horizontal sync frequency<a class="indexterm" name="idm143"></a> is just the number of times per second
the monitor can write a horizontal scan line; it is the single most
important statistic about your monitor.  The vertical sync frequency
is the number of times per second the monitor can traverse its beam
vertically.</p><p>Sync frequencies are usually listed on the specifications page
of your monitor manual.  The vertical sync
frequency<a class="indexterm" name="idm146"></a> number is typically calibrated in Hz
(cycles per second), the horizontal one in KHz (kilocycles per
second).  The usual ranges are between 50 and 150Hz vertical, and
between 31 and 135KHz horizontal.</p><p>If you have a multisync monitor, these frequencies will be given
as ranges.  Some monitors, especially lower-end ones, have multiple
fixed frequencies.  These can be configured too, but your options will
be severely limited by the built-in monitor characteristics.  Choose
the highest frequency pair for best resolution.  And be careful ---
trying to clock a fixed-frequency monitor at a higher speed than it's
designed for can easily damage it.</p><p>Earlier versions of this guide were pretty cavalier about overdriving
multisync monitors, pushing them past their nominal highest vertical 
sync frequency in order to get better performance.  We have since had more
reasons pointed out to us for caution on this score; we'll cover those under
<a class="link" href="ar01s13.html" title="13. Overdriving Your Monitor">Overdriving Your Monitor</a> below.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm151"></a>6.2. The monitor's video bandwidth</h3></div></div></div><p>Your monitor's video bandwidth should be included on the
manual's spec page.  If it's not, look at the monitor's higest rated
resolution.  As a rule of thumb, here's how to translate these into
bandwidth estimates (and thus into rough upper bounds for the dot
clock you can use):</p><pre class="screen">
	640x480			25
	800x600			36
	1024x768		65
	1024x768 interlaced	45
	1280x1024		110
	1600x1200		185
</pre><p>BTW, there's nothing magic about this table; these numbers are just
the lowest dot clocks per resolution in the standard X Modes
database (except for the last, which I extrapolated).  The bandwidth
of your monitor may actually be higher than the minimum needed for its
top resolution, so don't be afraid to try a dot clock a few MHz
higher.</p><p>Also note that bandwidth is seldom an issue for dot clocks under
65MHz or so.  With an SVGA card and most hi-res monitors, you can't
get anywhere near the limit of your monitor's video bandwidth.  The
following are examples: </p><pre class="screen">
	Brand				Video Bandwidth
	----------			---------------
	NEC 4D				75Mhz
	Nano 907a			50Mhz
	Nano 9080i			60Mhz
	Mitsubishi HL6615		110Mhz
	Mitsubishi Diamond Scan		100Mhz
	IDEK MF-5117			65Mhz
	IOCOMM Thinksync-17 CM-7126	136Mhz
	HP D1188A			100Mhz
	Philips SC-17AS			110Mhz
	Swan SW617			85Mhz
	Viewsonic 21PS			185Mhz
	PanaSync/Pro P21		220Mhz
</pre><p>Even low-end monitors usually aren't terribly
bandwidth-constrained for their rated resolutions.  The NEC Multisync
II makes a good example --- it can't even display 800x600 per its
spec.  It can only display 800x560.  For such low resolutions you
don't need high dot clocks or a lot of bandwidth; probably the best
you can do is 32Mhz or 36Mhz, both of them are still not too far from
the monitor's rated video bandwidth of 30Mhz. </p><p>At these two driving frequencies, your screen image may not be
as sharp as it should be, but definitely of tolerable quality. Of
course it would be nicer if NEC Multisync II had a video bandwidth
higher than, say, 36Mhz.  But this is not critical for common tasks
like text editing, as long as the difference is not so significant as
to cause severe image distortion (your eyes would tell you right away
if this were so).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm160"></a>6.3. The card's dot clock</h3></div></div></div><p>Your video adapter manual's spec page will usually give you the
card's maximum dot clock<a class="indexterm" name="idm163"></a> (that is, the total number of pixels per
second it can write to the screen).</p><p>If you don't have this information, the X server will get it for you.
Recent versions of the X servers all support a --probeonly option that
prints out this information and exits without actually starting up X
or changing the video mode.</p><p>If you don't have -probeonly, don't depair.  Even if your X locks up
your monitor, it will emit a line of clock and other info to standard
error.  If you redirect this to a file, it should be saved even if you
have to reboot to get your console back.</p><p>The probe result or startup message should look something like one of
the following examples:</p><p>If you're using X.org or XFree86:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>Note: do this with your machine unloaded (if at all possible).
Because X is an application, its timing loops can collide with disk
activity, rendering the numbers above inaccurate.  Do it several times
and watch for the numbers to stabilize; if they don't, start killing
processes until they do.  Your mouse daemon process, if you have one,
is particularly likely to trip you up (that's gpm for Linux users,
mousemgr for SVr4 users).</p><p>In order to avoid the clock-probe inaccuracy, you should clip
out the clock timings and put them in your Xconfig as the value of the
Clocks property --- this suppresses the timing loop and gives X an
exact list of the clock values it can try.  Using the data from the
example above:</p><pre class="screen">
wga
	Clocks	25 28 40 3 50 77 36 45 0 0 79 31 94 65 75 71
</pre><p>On systems with a highly variable load, this may help you avoid
mysterious X startup failures.  It's possible for X to come up, get
its timings wrong due to system load, and then not be able to find a
matching dot clock in its config database --- or find the wrong
one!</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm176"></a>6.4. What these basic statistics control</h3></div></div></div><p>The sync frequency ranges of your monitor, together with
your video adapter's dot clock, determine the ultimate resolution that
you can use.  But it's up to the driver to tap the potential of your
hardware.  A superior hardware combination without an equally
competent device driver is a waste of money.  On the other hand, with
a versatile device driver but less capable hardware, you can push the
hardware a little beyond its rated performance.  This is the design
philosophy of X.</p><p>You should match the dot clock you use to the monitor's video
bandwidth.  There's a lot of give here, though --- some monitors can
run as much as 30% over their nominal bandwidth.  The risks here have
to do with exceeding the monitor's rated vertical-sync frequency;
we'll discuss them in detail below.</p><p>Knowing the bandwidth will enable you to make more intelligent choices
between possible configurations.  It may affect your display's visual
quality (especially sharpness for fine details).</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5. How Video Displays Work </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7. Interpreting the Basic Specifications</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
