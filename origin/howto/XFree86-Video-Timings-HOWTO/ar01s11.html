clock, found the refresh rate acceptable, and checked that you have
enough VRAM.  Now for the real black magic -- you need to know when
and where to place synchronization pulses.</p><p>The sync pulses actually control the horizontal and vertical
scan frequencies of the monitor.  The HSF and VSF you've pulled off
the spec sheet are nominal, approximate maximum sync frequencies.  The
sync pulse in the signal from the adapter card tells the monitor how
fast to actually run.</p><p>Recall the two pictures above?  Only part of the time required
for raster-scanning a frame is used for displaying viewable image
(ie. your resolution).</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm280"></a>11.1. Horizontal Sync:</h3></div></div></div><p>By previous definition, it takes HFL ticks to trace the a
horizontal scan line.  Let's call the visible tick count (your
horizontal screen resolution) HR.  Then Obviously, HR &lt; HFL by
definition.  For concreteness, let's assume both start at the same
instant as shown below:</p><pre class="screen">

  0                       ^               ^     unit: ticks
                          |   ^       ^   |
                          HR  |       |  HFL
                          |   |&lt;-----&gt;|   |
                          |&lt;-&gt;|  HSP  |&lt;-&gt;|
                          HGT1         HGT2
</pre><p>Now, we would like to place a sync pulse of length HSP as shown
above, ie, between the end of clock ticks for display data and the end
of clock ticks for the entire frame.  Why so?  because if we can
achieve this, then your screen image won't shift to the right or to
the left.  It will be where it supposed to be on the screen, covering
squarely the monitor's viewable area.</p><p>Furthermore, we want about 30 ticks of "guard time" on either
side of the sync pulse.  This is represented by HGT1 and HGT2.  In a
typical configuration HGT1 != HGT2, but if you're building a
configuration from scratch, you want to start your experimentation
with them equal (that is, with the sync pulse centered).</p><p>The symptom of a misplaced sync pulse is that the image is
displaced on the screen, with one border excessively wide and the
other side of the image wrapped around the screen edge, producing a
white edge line and a band of "ghost image" on that side.  A
way-out-of-place vertical sync pulse can actually cause the image to
roll like a TV with a mis-adjusted vertical hold (in fact, it's the
same phenomenon at work).</p><p>If you're lucky, your monitor's sync pulse widths will be
documented on its specification page.  If not, here's where the real
black magic starts...</p><p>You'll have to do a little trial and error for this part.  But
most of the time, we can safely assume that a sync pulse is about 3.5
to 4.0 microsecond in length.</p><p>For concretness again, let's take HSP to be 3.8 microseconds
(which btw, is not a bad value to start with when
experimenting).</p><p>Now, using the 65Mhz clock timing above, we know HSP is
equivalent to 247 clock ticks (= 65 * 10**6 * 3.8 * 10^-6)
[recall M=10^6, micro=10^-6]</p><p>Some vendors like to quote their horizontal framing parameters as
timings rather than dot widths.  You may see the following

</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm313"></a>11.2. Vertical Sync:</h3></div></div></div><p>Going back to the picture above, how do we place the 247 clock
ticks as shown in the picture?</p><p>Using our example, HR is 944 and HFL is 1176.  The difference
between the two is 1176 - 944=232 &lt; 247!  Obviously we have to do some
adjustment here.  What can we do?</p><p>The first thing is to raise 1176 to 1184, and lower 944 to 936.
Now the difference = 1184-936= 248. Hmm, closer.</p><p>Next, instead using 3.8, we use 3.5 for calculating HSP; then, we have
65*3.5=227.  Looks better.  But 248 is not much higher than 227.  It's normally
necessary to have 30 or so clock ticks between HR and the start of SP, and the
same for the end of SP and HFL.  AND they have to be multiple of eight!  Are we
stuck?</p><p>No.  Let's do this, 936 % 8 = 0, (936 + 32) % 8 = 0 too.  But
936 + 32 = 968, 968 + 227 = 1195, 1195 + 32 = 1227.  Hmm.. this looks
not too bad.  But it's not a multiple of 8, so let's round it up to
1232.</p><p>But now we have potential trouble, the sync pulse is no longer
placed right in the middle between h and H any more.  Happily, using
our calculator we find 1232 - 32 = 1200 is also a multiple of 8 and
(1232 - 32) - 968 = 232 corresponding using a sync pulse of 3.57
microseconds long, still reasonable.</p><p>In addition, 936/1232 ~ 0.76 or 76%, still not far from 80%, so
it should be all right.</p><p>Furthermore, using the current horizontal frame length, we
basically ask our monitor to sync at 52.7khz (= 65Mhz/1232) which is
within its capability.  No problems.</p><p>Using rules of thumb we mentioned before, 936*75%=702, This is
our new vertical resolution.  702 * 1.05 = 737, our new vertical frame
length.</p><p>Screen refresh rate = 65Mhz/(737*1232)=71.6 Hz.  This is still
excellent.</p><p>Figuring the vertical sync pulse layout is similar:</p><pre class="screen">

                            VGT    VSP
</pre><p>We start the sync pulse just past the end of the vertical
display data ticks.  VGT is the vertical guard time required for the
sync pulse.  Most monitors are comfortable with a VGT of 0 (no guard
time) and we'll use that in this example.  A few need two or three
ticks of guard time, and it usually doesn't hurt to add that.</p><p>Returning to the example: since by the defintion of frame
length, a vertical tick is the time for tracing a complete HORIZONTAL
frame, therefore in our example, it is 1232/65Mhz=18.95us.</p><p>Experience shows that a vertical sync pulse should be in the
range of 50us and 300us.  As an example let's use 150us, which
translates into 8 vertical clock ticks (150us/18.95us~8).</p><p>Some makers like to quote their vertical framing parameters as
