	The highest frequency you can feed into your monitor's video
	input and still expect to see anything discernible. If your adaptor
	produces an alternating on/off pattern (as in an interlaced
	mode), its lowest frequency is half the DCF, so in theory
	bandwidth starts making sense at DCF/2. For tolerately crisp
	display of fine details in the video image, however,
	you don't want it much below your highest DCF, and preferably
	higher.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">frame length (HFL, VFL)</span></dt><dd><p>
	Horizontal frame length (HFL) is the number of dot-clock ticks
	needed for your monitor's electron gun to scan one horizontal line,
	<span class="emphasis"><em>including the inactive left and right borders</em></span>.  Vertical
	frame length (VFL) is the number of scan lines in the
	<span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> image, including the inactive top and bottom
	borders.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">screen refresh rate (RR)</span></dt><dd><p>
	The number of times per second your screen is repainted (this is
	also called "frame rate").  Higher frequencies are better, as they
	reduce flicker.  60Hz is good, VESA-standard 72Hz is better.
	Compute it as</p><pre class="screen">
	RR = DCF / (HFL * VFL)

	as the monitor's visible resolution, but typically somewhat larger.
	We'll get to the details of this below.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The rates for which interlaced modes are usually specified (like 87Hz
interlaced) are actually the half-frame rates: an entire screen seems
to have about that flicker frequency for typical displays, but every
single line is refreshed only half as often.</p><p>For calculation purposes we reckon an interlaced display at its
full-frame (refresh) rate, i.e. 43.5Hz. The quality of an interlaced
mode is better than that of a non-interlaced mode with the same
full-frame rate, but definitely worse than the non-interlaced one
corresponding to the half-frame rate.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm216"></a>7.1. About Bandwidth</h3></div></div></div><p>Monitor makers like to advertise high bandwidth because it
constrains the sharpness of intensity and color changes on the screen.
A high bandwidth means smaller visible details.</p><p>Your monitor uses electronic signals to present an image to your
eyes.  Such signals always come in wave form once they are
converted into analog form from digitized form.  They can be
considered as combinations of many simpler wave forms each one of
which has a fixed frequency, many of them are in the Mhz range, eg,
20Mhz, 40Mhz, or even 70Mhz.  Your monitor video bandwidth is,
effectively, the highest-frequency analog signal it can handle without
distortion.</p><p>For our purposes, video bandwidth<a class="indexterm" name="idm221"></a> is mainly important as an approximate
cutoff point for the highest dot clock you can use.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm223"></a>7.2. Sync Frequencies and the Refresh Rate:</h3></div></div></div><p>Each horizontal scan line on the display is just the visible
portion of a frame-length scan.  At any instant there is actually only
one dot active on the screen, but with a fast enough refresh rate your
eye's persistence of vision enables you to "see" the whole
image.</p><p>Here are some pictures to help:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>Remember that the actual raster scan is a very tight zigzag
pattern; that is, the beam moves left-right and at the same time
up-down.</p><p>Now we can see how the dot clock and frame size relates to
refresh rate.  By definition, one hertz (hz) is one cycle per second.
So, if your horizontal frame length is HFL and your vertical frame
length is VFL, then to cover the entire screen takes (HFL * VFL)
ticks.  Since your card emits DCF ticks per second by definition, then
obviously your monitor's electron gun(s) can sweep the screen from
left to right and back and from bottom to top and back DCF / (HFL *
VFL) times/sec.  This is your screen's refresh rate, because it's how
many times your screen can be updated (thus
<span class="emphasis"><em>refreshed</em></span>) per second! </p><p>You need to understand this concept to design a configuration
which trades off resolution against flicker in whatever way suits your
needs.</p><p>For those of you who handle visuals better than text, here is one:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>This is a generic monitor mode diagram.  The x axis of the diagram
shows the clock rate (DCF), the y axis represents the refresh rate
(RR). The filled region of the diagram describes the monitor's
capabilities: every point within this region is a possible video
mode.</p><p>The lines labeled `R1' and `R2' represent a fixed resolutions
(such as 640x480); they are meant to illustrate how one resolution can
be realized by many different combinations of dot clock and refresh
rate. The R2 line would represent a higher resolution than R1.</p><p>The top and bottom boundaries of the permitted region are simply
horizontal lines representing the limiting values for the vertical sync
frequency. The video bandwidth is an upper limit to the clock rate and
hence is represented by a vertical line bounding the capability region on
the right.</p><p>Under <a class="link" href="ar01s17.html" title="17. Plotting Monitor Capabilities">Plotting Monitor
Capabilities</a> you'll find a program that will help you plot a
diagram like this (but much nicer, with X graphics) for your
individual monitor.  That section also discusses the interesting part;
the derivation of the boundaries resulting from the limits on the
horizontal sync frequency.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">6. Basic Things to Know about your Display and Adapter </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 8. Tradeoffs in Configuring your System</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
