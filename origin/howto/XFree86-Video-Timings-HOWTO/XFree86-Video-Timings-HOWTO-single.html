when driving it outside the manufacturer's specs. Read <a class="link" href="#overd" title="13. Overdriving Your Monitor">
Overdriving Your Monitor</a> for detailed cautions. Any damage to

<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send email pleading for a magic solution to
your special monitor problem, as doing so will only burn up my time
and frustrate you -- everything I know about the subject is already in
here.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="obsolete"></a>2. Why This HOWTO Is Obsolete</h2></div></div></div><p>In X.org (and for 4.0.0 and later versions of the now-obsolete
XFree86) you no longer have to generate modelines at all under most
circumstances.  Instead they are computed internally by the server at
startup time, based on the resolution you specify in the monitor
capabilities your X server gets via an EDID query to the monitor (and
the Modes part of the Screen section part of your X configuration
file, if you have one). </p><p>To change your screen resolution and color depth, simply edit or
create a Display section describing it.  Here is a sample Screen
description from the X configuration file of my laptop:</p><pre class="screen">
Section "Screen"
	Identifier   "Screen0"
        Device       "ATI Rage Mobility"
        Monitor      "Monitor0"
	DefaultDepth	16

	Subsection "Display"
        	Depth       16
                Modes       "1024x768" 
	EndSubsection

EndSection
</pre><p>All you will usually need to do is change the numbers in the
Modes entry.  X will do the rest.  If you specify an impossible
resolution, it will fall back to the closest approximation that the EDID
data from the monitor says it can support.</p><p>Therefore, the information in the remainder of this HOWTO is
useful only if (a) you have an old, pre-EDID monitor, or (b) your
graphics-card driver doesn't support querying the monitor, or (c) you
are running a very old version of X (in which case, you should
fix your problem by upgrading), or (d) your monitor/card combination
operates outside the range over which X has canned modelines.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="introduction"></a>3. Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>The X server allows users to configure their video
subsystem and thus encourages best use of existing hardware.  This
document is intended to help you learn how to generate your own timing
numbers to make optimum use of your video card and monitor.</p><p>We'll present a method for getting something that works, and
then show you how you can experiment starting from that base to
develop settings that optimize for your taste.</p><p>If you already have a mode that almost works (in particular, if
one of predefined VESA modes gives you a stable display but one that's
displaced right or left, or too small, or too large) you can go
straight to the section on <a class="link" href="#fixes" title="16. Fixing Problems with the Image.">Fixing Problems with
the Image</a>.  This will enlighten you on ways to tweak the timing
numbers to achieve particular effects.</p><p>Don't assume that you need to get all the way into mode tuning
just because your X comes up with a scrambled display first time after
installation; it may be that most of the factory mode lines are OK and
you just happened to default to one that doesn't fit your
hardware. Instead, cycle through all your installed modes with
<span class="keysym">CTRL-ALT-KP+</span>. If some of the modes look OK, try
commenting out all but a 640x480 and check that the mode works. If it
does then uncomment a couple of other modes, e.g. an 800x600 and a
1024x768 at a frequency that your monitor should be able to
handle.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tools"></a>4. Tools for Automatic Computation</h2></div></div></div><p>All modern monitors support the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vesa.org/summary/sumeedidrar1.htm" target="_top">EDID</a>
specification. EDID-capable monitors report their capabilities to your
computer.</p><p>All modern X driver modules support DDC, the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vesa.org/dload/summary/sumeddcv1.htm" target="_top">VESA Display
Data Channel facility</a>.  A DDC-enabled graphics-card module
will ask the monitor to hand it an EDID capability description and
configure itself from that data.  So with any recent monitor,
you are likely not to have to do any configuration at all.</p><p>If your graphics-card module happens not to be DDC-enabled but
your monitor speaks EDID, you can still use the read-edid program to
ask the monitor for its statistics and compute a mode line for you.
See the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.polypux.org/projects/read-edid/" target="_top">read-edid home
page</a>.</p><p>A manual modeline generator lives <a class="ulink" href="http://zaph.com/Modeline" target="_top">here</a>.  You can either download
the Python script or use the CGI form provided.</p><p>X provides a tool called
<span class="application">xvidtune</span> which you will probably find quite useful
for testing and tuning monitor modes.  It begins with a gruesome
warning about the possible consequences of mistakes with it.  If you
pay careful attention to this document and learn what is behind the
pretty numbers in xvidtune's boxes, you will become able to use
xvidtune effectively and with confidence.</p><p>If you have <span class="application">xvidtune</span>(1), you'll be able to
test new modes on the fly, without modifying your X configuration
files or even rebooting your X server.  Otherwise, X allows you
to hot-key between different modes defined in Xconfig (see X.man
for details).  Use this capabilty to save yourself hassles!  When you
want to test a new mode, give it a unique mode label and add it to the
<span class="emphasis"><em>end</em></span> of your hot-key list.  Leave a known-good
mode as the default to fall back on if the test mode doesn't work.</p><p>Towards the end of this document, we include a `modeplot' script that
you can use to produce an analog graph of available modes.  This is
not directly helpful for generating modelines, but it may help you
better understand the relationships that define them.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="video"></a>5. How Video Displays Work</h2></div></div></div><p>Knowing how the
display<a class="indexterm" name="idm114"></a> works is
essential to understanding what numbers to put in the various fields
in the file Xconfig.  Those values are used in the lowest levels of
controlling the display by the X server.</p><p>The display generates a picture from what you could consider to be a
series of raster dots. The dots are arranged from left to right to form
lines.  The lines are arranged from top to bottom to form the picture.
The dots emit light when they are struck by the electron beams inside
the display, one for each primary color.  To make the beams strike
each dot for an equal amount of time, the beams are swept across the
display in a constant pattern, called a raster.</p><p>We say "what you could consider to be a series of dots" because
these raster dots don't actually correspond to physical phosphor dots.
The physical phosphor dots are much smaller than raster dots -- they
have to be, otherwise the display would suffer from severe
moiré-pattern effects.  The raster dots are really samples of
the analog driver signal, and display as a grid of dots only because
the peaks and valleys in the signal are quite regularly and finely
spaced.</p><p>The pattern starts at the top left of the screen, goes across
the screen to the right in a straight line, moving ever so slightly
"downhill" (the downhill slope is too small to be perceptible). Then
the beams are swept back to the left side of the display, starting at
a new line.  The new line is swept from left to right just as the
first line was.  This pattern is repeated until the bottom line on the
display has been swept.  Then the beams are moved from the bottom
right corner of the display (sweeping back and forth a few times) to
the top left corner, and the pattern is started over again.</p><p>There is one variation of this scheme known as
interlacing<a class="indexterm" name="idm120"></a>: here
only every second line is swept during one half-frame and the others
are filled in during a second half-frame.</p><p>Starting the beams at the top left of the display is called the
beginning of a frame.  The frame ends when the beams reach the top
left corner again as they come from the bottom right corner of the
display.  A frame is made up of all of the lines the beams traced from
the top of the display to the bottom.</p><p>If the electron beams were on all of the time they were sweeping
through the frame, all of the dots on the display would be
illuminated.  There would be no black border around the edges of the
display.  At the edges of the display the picture would become
distorted because the beams are hard to control there.  To reduce the
distortion, the dots around the edges of the display are not
illuminated by the beams (because they're turned off) even though the
beams, if they were turned on, would be pointing at them.  The
viewable area of the display is reduced this way.</p><p>Another important thing to understand is what becomes of the beams
when no spot is being painted on the visible area.  The time the beams
would have been illuminating the side borders of the display is used
for sweeping the beams back from the right edge to the left. The time
the beams would have been illuminating the top and bottom borders of
the display is used for moving the beams from the bottom-right corner
of the display to the top-left corner.</p><p>The adapter card generates the signals which cause the display to turn
on the electron beams (according to the desired color) at each dot to
generate a picture. The card also controls when the display moves the
beams from the right side back to the left by generating a signal
called the horizontal sync (for synchronization) pulse.  One
horizontal sync pulse occurs at the end of every line.  The adapter
also generates a vertical sync pulse which signals the display to move
the beams to the top-left corner of the display.  A vertical sync
pulse is generated near the end of every frame.</p><p>The display requires that there be short time periods both before and
after the horizontal and vertical sync pulses so that the position of
the electron beams can stabilize.  If the beams can't stabilize, the
picture will not be steady.</p><p>For more information, see <a class="ulink" href="http://fribble.cie.rpi.edu/~repairfaq/REPAIR/F_deflfaq.html" target="_top">TV
and Monitor Deflection Systems</a>.</p><p>In a later section, we'll come back to these basics with definitions,
formulas and examples to help you use them.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="basic"></a>6. Basic Things to Know about your Display and Adapter</h2></div></div></div><p>There are some fundamental things you need to know before
hacking an Xconfig entry.  These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>your monitor's horizontal and vertical sync frequency options</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>your monitor's bandwidth</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>your video adapter's driving clock frequencies, or "dot clocks"</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm140"></a>6.1. The monitor sync frequencies</h3></div></div></div><p>The horizontal sync frequency<a class="indexterm" name="idm143"></a> is just the number of times per second
the monitor can write a horizontal scan line; it is the single most
important statistic about your monitor.  The vertical sync frequency
is the number of times per second the monitor can traverse its beam
vertically.</p><p>Sync frequencies are usually listed on the specifications page
of your monitor manual.  The vertical sync
frequency<a class="indexterm" name="idm146"></a> number is typically calibrated in Hz
(cycles per second), the horizontal one in KHz (kilocycles per
second).  The usual ranges are between 50 and 150Hz vertical, and
between 31 and 135KHz horizontal.</p><p>If you have a multisync monitor, these frequencies will be given
as ranges.  Some monitors, especially lower-end ones, have multiple
fixed frequencies.  These can be configured too, but your options will
be severely limited by the built-in monitor characteristics.  Choose
the highest frequency pair for best resolution.  And be careful ---
trying to clock a fixed-frequency monitor at a higher speed than it's
designed for can easily damage it.</p><p>Earlier versions of this guide were pretty cavalier about overdriving
multisync monitors, pushing them past their nominal highest vertical 
sync frequency in order to get better performance.  We have since had more
reasons pointed out to us for caution on this score; we'll cover those under
<a class="link" href="#overd" title="13. Overdriving Your Monitor">Overdriving Your Monitor</a> below.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm151"></a>6.2. The monitor's video bandwidth</h3></div></div></div><p>Your monitor's video bandwidth should be included on the
manual's spec page.  If it's not, look at the monitor's higest rated
resolution.  As a rule of thumb, here's how to translate these into
bandwidth estimates (and thus into rough upper bounds for the dot
clock you can use):</p><pre class="screen">
	640x480			25
	800x600			36
	1024x768		65
	1024x768 interlaced	45
	1280x1024		110
	1600x1200		185
</pre><p>BTW, there's nothing magic about this table; these numbers are just
the lowest dot clocks per resolution in the standard X Modes
database (except for the last, which I extrapolated).  The bandwidth
of your monitor may actually be higher than the minimum needed for its
top resolution, so don't be afraid to try a dot clock a few MHz
higher.</p><p>Also note that bandwidth is seldom an issue for dot clocks under
65MHz or so.  With an SVGA card and most hi-res monitors, you can't
get anywhere near the limit of your monitor's video bandwidth.  The
following are examples: </p><pre class="screen">
	Brand				Video Bandwidth
	----------			---------------
	NEC 4D				75Mhz
	Nano 907a			50Mhz
	Nano 9080i			60Mhz
	Mitsubishi HL6615		110Mhz
	Mitsubishi Diamond Scan		100Mhz
	IDEK MF-5117			65Mhz
	IOCOMM Thinksync-17 CM-7126	136Mhz
	HP D1188A			100Mhz
	Philips SC-17AS			110Mhz
	Swan SW617			85Mhz
	Viewsonic 21PS			185Mhz
	PanaSync/Pro P21		220Mhz
</pre><p>Even low-end monitors usually aren't terribly
bandwidth-constrained for their rated resolutions.  The NEC Multisync
II makes a good example --- it can't even display 800x600 per its
spec.  It can only display 800x560.  For such low resolutions you
don't need high dot clocks or a lot of bandwidth; probably the best
you can do is 32Mhz or 36Mhz, both of them are still not too far from
the monitor's rated video bandwidth of 30Mhz. </p><p>At these two driving frequencies, your screen image may not be
as sharp as it should be, but definitely of tolerable quality. Of
course it would be nicer if NEC Multisync II had a video bandwidth
higher than, say, 36Mhz.  But this is not critical for common tasks
like text editing, as long as the difference is not so significant as
to cause severe image distortion (your eyes would tell you right away
if this were so).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm160"></a>6.3. The card's dot clock</h3></div></div></div><p>Your video adapter manual's spec page will usually give you the
card's maximum dot clock<a class="indexterm" name="idm163"></a> (that is, the total number of pixels per
second it can write to the screen).</p><p>If you don't have this information, the X server will get it for you.
Recent versions of the X servers all support a --probeonly option that
prints out this information and exits without actually starting up X
or changing the video mode.</p><p>If you don't have -probeonly, don't depair.  Even if your X locks up
your monitor, it will emit a line of clock and other info to standard
error.  If you redirect this to a file, it should be saved even if you
have to reboot to get your console back.</p><p>The probe result or startup message should look something like one of
the following examples:</p><p>If you're using X.org or XFree86:</p><pre class="screen">

your video adapter's dot clock, determine the ultimate resolution that
you can use.  But it's up to the driver to tap the potential of your
hardware.  A superior hardware combination without an equally
competent device driver is a waste of money.  On the other hand, with
a versatile device driver but less capable hardware, you can push the
hardware a little beyond its rated performance.  This is the design
philosophy of X.</p><p>You should match the dot clock you use to the monitor's video
bandwidth.  There's a lot of give here, though --- some monitors can
run as much as 30% over their nominal bandwidth.  The risks here have
to do with exceeding the monitor's rated vertical-sync frequency;
we'll discuss them in detail below.</p><p>Knowing the bandwidth will enable you to make more intelligent choices

A high bandwidth means smaller visible details.</p><p>Your monitor uses electronic signals to present an image to your
eyes.  Such signals always come in wave form once they are
converted into analog form from digitized form.  They can be
considered as combinations of many simpler wave forms each one of
which has a fixed frequency, many of them are in the Mhz range, eg,
20Mhz, 40Mhz, or even 70Mhz.  Your monitor video bandwidth is,
effectively, the highest-frequency analog signal it can handle without
distortion.</p><p>For our purposes, video bandwidth<a class="indexterm" name="idm221"></a> is mainly important as an approximate

</pre><p>Remember that the actual raster scan is a very tight zigzag
pattern; that is, the beam moves left-right and at the same time
up-down.</p><p>Now we can see how the dot clock and frame size relates to
refresh rate.  By definition, one hertz (hz) is one cycle per second.
So, if your horizontal frame length is HFL and your vertical frame
length is VFL, then to cover the entire screen takes (HFL * VFL)
ticks.  Since your card emits DCF ticks per second by definition, then
obviously your monitor's electron gun(s) can sweep the screen from
left to right and back and from bottom to top and back DCF / (HFL *
VFL) times/sec.  This is your screen's refresh rate, because it's how
many times your screen can be updated (thus
<span class="emphasis"><em>refreshed</em></span>) per second! </p><p>You need to understand this concept to design a configuration
which trades off resolution against flicker in whatever way suits your
needs.</p><p>For those of you who handle visuals better than text, here is one:</p><pre class="screen">

individual monitor.  That section also discusses the interesting part;
the derivation of the boundaries resulting from the limits on the
horizontal sync frequency.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tradeoffs"></a>8. Tradeoffs in Configuring your System</h2></div></div></div><p>Another way to look at the formula we derived above is</p><pre class="screen">
	DCF = RR * HFL * VFL
</pre><p>That is, your dot clock is fixed.  You can use those dots per
second to buy either refresh rate, horizontal resolution, or vertical
resolution.  If one of those increases, one or both of the others must
decrease.</p><p>Note, though, that your refresh rate cannot be greater than the maximum
vertical sync frequency of your monitor.  Thus, for any given monitor at a
given dot clock, there is a minimum product of frame lengths below which you
can't force it.</p><p>In choosing your settings, remember: if you set RR too low, you will
get mugged by screen flicker. Keep it above 60Hz.  72Hz is the VESA
ergonomic standard. 120Hz is the flicker rate of fluorescent lights
in the U.S. (100MHz is Europe and other places with 50-cycle current);
if you're sensitive to those, you need to keep it above that.</p><p>Flicker is very eye-fatiguing, though human eyes are adaptable
and peoples' tolerance for it varies widely.  If you face your monitor
at a 90% viewing angle, are using a dark background and a good
contrasting color for foreground, and stick with low to medium
intensity, you *may* be comfortable at as little as 45Hz.</p><p>The acid test is this: open a xterm with pure white back-ground
and black foreground using <span class="application">xterm -bg white -fg
black</span> and make it so large as to cover the entire viewable
area.  Now turn your monitor's intensity to 3/4 of its maximum
setting, and turn your face away from the monitor.  Try peeking at
your monitor sideways (bringing the more sensitive peripheral-vision
cells into play).  If you don't sense any flicker or if you feel the
flickering is tolerable, then that refresh rate is fine with you.
Otherwise you better configure a higher refresh rate, because that
semi-invisible flicker is going to fatigue your eyes like crazy and
give you headaches, even if the screen looks OK to normal
vision.</p><p>For interlaced modes, the amount of flicker depends on more factors
such as the current vertical resolution and the actual screen
contents.  So just experiment.  You won't want to go much below about
85Hz half frame rate, though.</p><p>So let's say you've picked a minimum acceptable refresh rate.
In choosing your HFL and VFL, you'll have some room for
maneuver.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sizes"></a>9. Memory Requirements</h2></div></div></div><p>Available frame-buffer RAM may limit the resolution you can
achieve on color or gray-scale displays.  It probably isn't a factor
on displays that have only two colors, white and black with no shades
of gray in between.</p><p>For 256-color displays, a byte of video memory is required for each
visible dot to be shown.  This byte contains the information that
determines what mix of red, green, and blue is generated for its dot.
To get the amount of memory required, multiply the number of visible
dots per line by the number of visible lines.  For a display with a
resolution of 1024x768, this would be 1024 x 768 = 786432, which is
the number of visible dots on the display.  This is also, at one byte
per dot, the number of bytes of video memory that will be necessary on
your adapter card.</p><p>Thus, your memory requirement will typically be (HR * VR)/1024
Kbytes of VRAM, rounded up (it would come to 768K exactly in this
example).  If you have more memory than strictly required, you'll have
extra for virtual-screen panning.</p><p>However, if you only have 512K on board yor video card, then you won't
be able to use this resolution.  Even if you have a good monitor,
without enough video RAM, you can't take advantage of your monitor's
potential.  On the other hand, if your SVGA has one meg, but your
monitor can display at most 800x600, then high resolution is beyond
your reach anyway (see <a class="link" href="#inter" title="14. Using Interlaced Modes">Using Interlaced Modes</a>
for a possible remedy).</p><p>Don't worry if you have more memory than required; the X server
will make use of it by allowing you to scroll your viewable area (see
the Xconfig file documentation on the virtual screen size parameter).
Remember also that a card with 512K bytes of memory really doesn't
have 512,000 bytes installed, it has 512 x 1024 = 524,288
bytes.</p><p>If you're running X/Inside using an S3 card, and are willing to live
with 16 colors (4 bits per pixel), you can set depth 4 in Xconfig and
effectively double the resolution your card can handle.  S3 cards, for
example, normally do 1024x768x256.  You can make them do 1280x1024x16
with depth 4.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="framesizes"></a>10. Computing Frame Sizes</h2></div></div></div><p>Warning: this method was developed for multisync monitors.  It
will probably work with fixed-frequency monitors as well, but no
guarantees!</p><p>Start by dividing DCF by your highest available HSF to get a horizontal
frame length.</p><p>For example; suppose you have a Sigma Legend SVGA with a 65MHz
dot clock, and your monitor has a 55KHz horizontal scan frequency.
The quantity (DCF / HSF) is then 1181 (65MHz = 65000KHz; 65000/55 =
1181).</p><p>Now for our first bit of black magic.  You need to round this
figure to the nearest multiple of 8.  This has to do with the VGA
hardware controller used by SVGA and S3 cards; it uses an 8-bit
register, left-shifted 3 bits, for what's really an 11-bit quantity.
Other card types such as ATI 8514/A may not have this requirement, but
we don't know and the correction can't hurt.  So round the usable
horizontal frame length figure down to 1176.</p><p>This figure (DCF / HSF rounded to a multiple of 8) is the
minimum HFL you can use.  You can get longer HFLs (and thus, possibly,
more horizontal dots on the screen) by setting the sync pulse to
produce a lower HSF.  But you'll pay with a slower and more visible
flicker rate.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, 80% of the horizontal frame length is available for
horizontal resolution, the visible part of the horizontal scan line (this
allows, roughly, for borders and sweepback time -- that is, the time required
for the beam to move from the right screen edge to the left edge of the next
raster line).  In this example, that's 940 ticks.</p><p>Now, to get the normal 4:3 screen aspect ratio, set your
vertical resolution to 3/4ths of the horizontal resolution you just
calculated.  For this example, that's 705 ticks.  To get your actual
VFL, multiply that by 1.05 to get 740 ticks.</p><p>The 4:3 is not technically magic; nothing prevents you from using a
different ratio if that will get the best use out of your screen real
estate.  It does make figuring frame height and frame width from the
diagonal size convenient, you just multiply the diagonal by 0.8 to
get width and 0.6 to get height.</p><p>So, HFL=1176 and VFL=740.  Dividing 65MHz by the product of the two gives
us a nice, healthy 74.6Hz refresh rate.  Excellent!  Better than VESA standard!
And you got 944x705 to boot, more than the 800 by 600 you were probably
expecting.  Not bad at all!</p><p>You can even improve the refresh rate further, to almost 76 Hz,
by using the fact that monitors can often sync horizontally at 2khz or
so higher than rated, and by lowering VFL somewhat (that is, taking
less than 75% of 940 in the example above).  But before you try this
"overdriving" maneuver, if you do, make <span class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> that
your monitor electron guns can sync up to 76 Hz vertical.  (the
popular NEC 4D, for instance, cannot.  It goes only up to 75 Hz VSF).
(See <a class="link" href="#overd" title="13. Overdriving Your Monitor">Overdriving Your Monitor</a> for more
general discussion of this issue. )</p><p>So far, most of this is simple arithmetic and basic facts about raster
displays.  Hardly any black magic at all!</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="magic"></a>11. Black Magic and Sync Pulses</h2></div></div></div><p>OK, now you've computed HFL/VFL numbers for your chosen dot
clock, found the refresh rate acceptable, and checked that you have
enough VRAM.  Now for the real black magic -- you need to know when
and where to place synchronization pulses.</p><p>The sync pulses actually control the horizontal and vertical
scan frequencies of the monitor.  The HSF and VSF you've pulled off
the spec sheet are nominal, approximate maximum sync frequencies.  The
sync pulse in the signal from the adapter card tells the monitor how
fast to actually run.</p><p>Recall the two pictures above?  Only part of the time required
for raster-scanning a frame is used for displaying viewable image
(ie. your resolution).</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm280"></a>11.1. Horizontal Sync:</h3></div></div></div><p>By previous definition, it takes HFL ticks to trace the a
horizontal scan line.  Let's call the visible tick count (your
horizontal screen resolution) HR.  Then Obviously, HR &lt; HFL by
definition.  For concreteness, let's assume both start at the same
instant as shown below:</p><pre class="screen">

                          HGT1         HGT2
</pre><p>Now, we would like to place a sync pulse of length HSP as shown
above, ie, between the end of clock ticks for display data and the end
of clock ticks for the entire frame.  Why so?  because if we can
achieve this, then your screen image won't shift to the right or to
the left.  It will be where it supposed to be on the screen, covering
squarely the monitor's viewable area.</p><p>Furthermore, we want about 30 ticks of "guard time" on either
side of the sync pulse.  This is represented by HGT1 and HGT2.  In a
typical configuration HGT1 != HGT2, but if you're building a
configuration from scratch, you want to start your experimentation
with them equal (that is, with the sync pulse centered).</p><p>The symptom of a misplaced sync pulse is that the image is
displaced on the screen, with one border excessively wide and the
other side of the image wrapped around the screen edge, producing a
white edge line and a band of "ghost image" on that side.  A
way-out-of-place vertical sync pulse can actually cause the image to
roll like a TV with a mis-adjusted vertical hold (in fact, it's the
same phenomenon at work).</p><p>If you're lucky, your monitor's sync pulse widths will be
documented on its specification page.  If not, here's where the real
black magic starts...</p><p>You'll have to do a little trial and error for this part.  But
most of the time, we can safely assume that a sync pulse is about 3.5
to 4.0 microsecond in length.</p><p>For concretness again, let's take HSP to be 3.8 microseconds
(which btw, is not a bad value to start with when
experimenting).</p><p>Now, using the 65Mhz clock timing above, we know HSP is
equivalent to 247 clock ticks (= 65 * 10**6 * 3.8 * 10^-6)
[recall M=10^6, micro=10^-6]</p><p>Some vendors like to quote their horizontal framing parameters as

ticks as shown in the picture?</p><p>Using our example, HR is 944 and HFL is 1176.  The difference
between the two is 1176 - 944=232 &lt; 247!  Obviously we have to do some
adjustment here.  What can we do?</p><p>The first thing is to raise 1176 to 1184, and lower 944 to 936.
Now the difference = 1184-936= 248. Hmm, closer.</p><p>Next, instead using 3.8, we use 3.5 for calculating HSP; then, we have
65*3.5=227.  Looks better.  But 248 is not much higher than 227.  It's normally
necessary to have 30 or so clock ticks between HR and the start of SP, and the
same for the end of SP and HFL.  AND they have to be multiple of eight!  Are we
stuck?</p><p>No.  Let's do this, 936 % 8 = 0, (936 + 32) % 8 = 0 too.  But
936 + 32 = 968, 968 + 227 = 1195, 1195 + 32 = 1227.  Hmm.. this looks
not too bad.  But it's not a multiple of 8, so let's round it up to
1232.</p><p>But now we have potential trouble, the sync pulse is no longer
placed right in the middle between h and H any more.  Happily, using
our calculator we find 1232 - 32 = 1200 is also a multiple of 8 and
(1232 - 32) - 968 = 232 corresponding using a sync pulse of 3.57
microseconds long, still reasonable.</p><p>In addition, 936/1232 ~ 0.76 or 76%, still not far from 80%, so
it should be all right.</p><p>Furthermore, using the current horizontal frame length, we
basically ask our monitor to sync at 52.7khz (= 65Mhz/1232) which is
within its capability.  No problems.</p><p>Using rules of thumb we mentioned before, 936*75%=702, This is
our new vertical resolution.  702 * 1.05 = 737, our new vertical frame
length.</p><p>Screen refresh rate = 65Mhz/(737*1232)=71.6 Hz.  This is still
excellent.</p><p>Figuring the vertical sync pulse layout is similar:</p><pre class="screen">

                            VGT    VSP
</pre><p>We start the sync pulse just past the end of the vertical
display data ticks.  VGT is the vertical guard time required for the
sync pulse.  Most monitors are comfortable with a VGT of 0 (no guard
time) and we'll use that in this example.  A few need two or three
ticks of guard time, and it usually doesn't hurt to add that.</p><p>Returning to the example: since by the defintion of frame
length, a vertical tick is the time for tracing a complete HORIZONTAL
frame, therefore in our example, it is 1232/65Mhz=18.95us.</p><p>Experience shows that a vertical sync pulse should be in the
range of 50us and 300us.  As an example let's use 150us, which
translates into 8 vertical clock ticks (150us/18.95us~8).</p><p>Some makers like to quote their vertical framing parameters as
timings rather than dot widths.  You may see the following

"Modes" line of the Graphics Driver Setup section of the Xconfig file.
The name field may be omitted if the name of a previous line is the
same as the current line.</p><p>The dot clock section contains only the dot clock (what we've
called DCF) field of the video mode line.  The number in this field
specifies what dot clock was used to generate the numbers in the
following sections.</p><p>The horizontal section consists of four fields which specify how each
horizontal line on the display is to be generated.  The first field of
the section contains the number of dots per line which will be
illuminated to form the picture (what we've called HR).  The second
field of the section (SH1) indicates at which dot the horizontal sync
pulse will begin.  The third field (SH2) indicates at which dot the
horizontal sync pulse will end.  The fourth field specifies the toal
horzontal frame length (HFL).</p><p>The vertical section also contains four fields.  The first field
contains the number of visible lines which will appear on the display
(VR).  The second field (SV1) indicates the line number at which the
vertical sync pulse will begin.  The third field (SV2) specifies the
line number at which the vertical sync pulse will end.  The fourth
field contains the total vertical frame length (VFL).</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>(Note: stock X11R5 doesn't support fractional dot clocks.)</p><p>For Xconfig, all of the numbers just mentioned - the number of
illuminated dots on the line, the number of dots separating the
illuminated dots from the beginning of the sync pulse, the number of
dots representing the duration of the pulse, and the number of dots
after the end of the sync pulse - are added to produce the number of
dots per line.  The number of horizontal dots must be evenly divisible
by eight.</p><p>Example horizontal numbers: 800 864 1024 1088</p><p>This sample line has the number of illuminated dots (800) followed by the
number of the dot when the sync pulse starts (864), followed by the number of
the dot when the sync pulse ends (1024), followed by the number of the last dot
on the horizontal line (1088).</p><p>Note again that all of the horizontal numbers (800, 864, 1024,
and 1088) are divisible by eight!  This is not required of the
vertical numbers.</p><p>The number of lines from the top of the display to the bottom form the frame.
The basic timing signal for a frame is the line.  A number of lines will
contain the picture.  After the last illuminated line has been displayed, a
delay of a number of lines will occur before the vertical sync pulse is
generated.  Then the sync pulse will last for a few lines, and finally the last
lines in the frame, the delay required after the pulse, will be generated.  The
numbers that specify this mode of operation are entered in a manner similar to
the following example.</p><p>Example vertical numbers: 600 603 609 630</p><p>This example indicates that there are 600 visible lines on the
display, that the vertical sync pulse starts with the 603rd line and
ends with the 609th, and that there are 630 total lines being
used.</p><p>Note that the vertical numbers don't have to be divisible by
eight!</p><p>Let's return to the example we've been working.  According to
the above, all we need to do from now on is to write our result into
Xconfig as follows:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;name&gt;   DCF     HR  SH1 SH2   HFL   VR  SV1 SV2 VFL
</pre><p>where SH1 is the start tick of the horizontal sync pulse and SH2
is its end tick; similarly, SV1 is the start tick of the vertical sync
pulse and SV2 is its end tick. </p><p>To place these, recall the discussion of black magic and sync
pulses given above.  SH1 is the dot that begins the leading edge of
the horiziontal sync pulse; thus, SH1 = HR + HGT1.  SH2 is the
trailing edge; thus, SH2 = SH1 + HSP.  Similarly, SV1 = VR + VGT (but
VGT is usually zero) and SV2 = SV1 + VSP.</p><pre class="screen">

monitor's scan rates if it's a fixed-frequency type.  You can smoke
your hardware doing this!  There are potentially subtler problems with
overdriving a multisync monitor which you should be aware of.</p><p>Having a pixel clock higher than the monitor's maximum bandwidth is
rather harmless, in contrast.  It's exceeding the rated maximum sync
frequencies that's problematic.  Some modern monitors might have
protection circuitry that shuts the monitor down at dangerous scan
rates, but don't rely on it.  In particular there are older multisync
monitors (like the Multisync II) which use just one horizontal
transformer. These monitors will not have much protection against
overdriving them.  While you necessarily have high voltage regulation
circuitry (which can be absent in fixed frequency monitors), it will
not necessarily cover every conceivable frequency range, especially in
cheaper models. This not only implies more wear on the circuitry, it
can also cause the screen phosphors to age faster, and cause more than
the specified radiation (including X-rays) to be emitted from the
monitor.</p><p>However, the basic problematic magnitude in question here is the slew
rate (the steepness of the video signals) of the video output drivers,
and that is usually independent of the actual pixel frequency, but
(if your board manufacturer cares about such problems) related
to the maximum pixel frequency of the board.</p><p>So be careful out there...</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="inter"></a>14. Using Interlaced Modes</h2></div></div></div><p>(This section is largely due to David Kastrup
<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:dak@gnu.org">dak@gnu.org</a>&gt;</code>)</p><p>At a fixed dot clock, an interlaced display is going to have
considerably less noticable flicker than a non-interlaced display, if
the vertical circuitry of your monitor is able to support it stably.
It is because of this that interlaced modes were invented in the first
place.</p><p>Interlaced modes got their bad reputation because they are inferior to
their non-interlaced companions at the same vertical scan frequency,
VSF (which is what is usually given in advertisements). But they are
definitely superior at the same horizontal scan rate, and that's where
the decisive limits of your monitor/graphics card usually lie.</p><p>At a fixed <span class="emphasis"><em>refresh rate</em></span> (or half frame
rate, or VSF) the interlaced display will flicker more: a 90Hz
interlaced display will be inferior to a 90Hz non-interlaced
display. It will, however, need only half the video bandwidth and half
the horizontal scan rate. If you compared it to a non-interlaced mode
with the same dot clock and the same scan rates, it would be vastly
superior: 45Hz non-interlaced is intolerable. With 90Hz interlaced, I
have worked for years with my Multisync 3D (at 1024x768) and am very
satisfied. I'd guess you'd need at least a 70Hz non-interlaced display
for similar comfort. </p><p>You have to watch a few points, though: use interlaced modes
only at high resolutions, so that the alternately lighted lines are
close together. You might want to play with sync pulse widths and
positions to get the most stable line positions. If alternating lines
are bright and dark, interlace will <span class="emphasis"><em>jump</em></span> at
you. I have one application that chooses such a dot pattern for a menu
background (XCept, no other application I know does that,
fortunately). I switch to 800x600 for using XCept because it really
hurts my eyes otherwise.</p><p>For the same reason, use at least 100dpi fonts, or other fonts where
horizontal beams are at least two lines thick (for high resolutions, 
nothing else will make sense anyhow).</p><p>And of course, never use an interlaced mode when your hardware would
support a non-interlaced one with similar refresh rate.</p><p>If, however, you find that for some resolution you are pushing either
monitor or graphics card to their upper limits, and getting
dissatisfactorily flickery or outwashed (bandwidth exceeded) display,
you might want to try tackling the same resolution using an
interlaced mode. Of course this is useless if the VSF
of your monitor is already close to its limits.</p><p>Design of interlaced modes is easy: do it like a non-interlaced
mode. Just two more considerations are necessary: you need an odd     
total number of vertical lines (the last number in your mode line), and
when you specify the "interlace" flag, the actual vertical frame rate
for your monitor doubles. Your monitor needs to support a 90Hz frame 
rate if the mode you specified looks like a 45Hz mode apart from the
"Interlace" flag.</p><p>As an example, here is my modeline for 1024x768 interlaced: my
Multisync 3D will support up to 90Hz vertical and 38kHz horizontal.</p><pre class="screen">
ModeLine "1024x768" 45 1024 1048 1208 1248 768 768 776 807 Interlace
</pre><p>Both limits are pretty much exhausted with this mode. Specifying the
same mode, just without the "Interlace" flag, still is almost at the
limit of the monitor's horizontal capacity (and strictly speaking, a
bit under the lower limit of vertical scan rate), but produces an
intolerably flickery display.</p><p>Basic design rules: if you have designed a mode at less than half of   
your monitor's vertical capacity, make the vertical total of lines odd
and add the "Interlace" flag. The display's quality should vastly    
improve in most cases.</p><p>If you have a non-interlaced mode otherwise exhausting your monitor's
specs where the vertical scan rate lies about 30% or more under the
maximum of your monitor, hand-designing an interlaced mode (probably
with somewhat higher resolution) could deliver superior results, but I
won't promise it.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="answe"></a>15. Questions and Answers</h2></div></div></div><div class="qandaset"><a name="idm404"></a><dl><dt>Q: <a href="#idm405">The example you gave is not a standard screen size, can I use it?</a></dt><dt>Q: <a href="#idm410">It this the only resolution given the 65Mhz dot clock and 55Khz

You put them in
Xconfig with a test mode label.  You fire up X, hot-key to the new
mode, ... and the image doesn't look right.  What do you do?  Here's a
list of common video image distortions<a class="indexterm" name="idm435"></a> and how to fix them.</p><p>(Fixing these minor distortions is where
<span class="application">xvidtune</span>(1) really shines.)</p><p>You <span class="emphasis"><em>move</em></span> the image by changing the sync
pulse timing.  You <span class="emphasis"><em>scale</em></span> it by changing the frame
length (you need to move the sync pulse to keep it in the same
relative position, otherwise scaling will move the image as well).
Here are some more specific recipes:</p><p>The horizontal and vertical positions are independent.  That is,
moving the image horizontally doesn't affect placement vertically, or
vice-versa.  However, the same is not quite true of scaling.  While
changing the horizontal size does nothing to the vertical size or vice
versa, the total change in both may be limited.  In particular, if
your image is too large in both dimensions you will probably have to
go to a higher dot clock to fix it.  Since this raises the usable
resolution, it is seldom a problem!</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm443"></a>16.1. The image is displaced to the left or right</h3></div></div></div><p>To fix this, move the horizontal sync pulse.  That is, increment or
decrement (by a multiple of 8) the middle two numbers of the
horizontal timing section that define the leading and trailing edge of
the horizontal sync pulse.</p><p>If the image is shifted left (right border too large, you want
to move the image to the right) decrement the numbers.  If the image
is shifted right (left border too large, you want it to move left)
increment the sync pulse.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm447"></a>16.2. The image is displaced up or down</h3></div></div></div><p>To fix this, move the vertical sync pulse.  That is, increment
or decrement the middle two numbers of the vertical timing section
that define the leading and trailing edge of the vertical sync pulse.</p><p>If the image is shifted up (lower border too large, you want to
move the image down) decrement the numbers.  If the image is shifted
down (top border too large, you want it to move up) increment the
numbers.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm451"></a>16.3. The image is too large both horizontally and vertically</h3></div></div></div><p>Switch to a higher card clock speed. If you have multiple modes

mistake.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm454"></a>16.4. The image is too wide (too narrow) horizontally</h3></div></div></div><p>To fix this, increase (decrease) the horizontal frame length.
That is, change the fourth number in the first timing section.  To
avoid moving the image, also move the sync pulse (second and third
numbers) half as far, to keep it in the same relative position.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm457"></a>16.5. The image is too deep (too shallow) vertically</h3></div></div></div><p>To fix this, increase (decrease) the vertical frame length.
That is, change the fourth number in the second timing section.  To
avoid moving the image, also move the sync pulse (second and third
numbers) half as far, to keep it in the same relative position.</p><p>Any distortion that can't be handled by combining these
techniques is probably evidence of something more basically wrong,
like a calculation mistake or a faster dot clock than the monitor can
handle.</p><p>Finally, remember that increasing either frame length will decrease your
refresh rate, and vice-versa.</p><p>Occasionally you can fix minor distortions by fiddling with the
picture controls on your monitor.  The disadvantage is that if you
take your controls too far off the neutral (factory) setting to fix
graphics-mode problems, you may end up with a wacky image in text
mode.  It's better to get your modeline right.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cplot"></a>17. Plotting Monitor Capabilities</h2></div></div></div><p>To plot a monitor mode diagram, you'll need the gnuplot package

</pre><p>Once you know you have <span class="application">modeplot</span> and the
gnuplot package in place, you'll need the following monitor
characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>video bandwidth (VB)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>range of horizontal sync frequency (HSF)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>range of vertical sync frequency (VSF)</p></li></ul></div><p>The plot program needs to make some simplifying assumptions which are
not necessarily correct.  This is the reason why the resulting diagram is
only a rough description. These assumptions are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>All resolutions have a single fixed aspect ratio AR =
HR/VR.  Standard resolutions have AR = 4/3 or AR = 5/4.  The
<span class="application">modeplot</span> programs assumes 4/3 by default, but you
can override this.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For the modes considered, horizontal and vertical
frame lengths are fixed multiples of horizontal and vertical
resolutions, respectively:</p><pre class="screen">
	HFL = F1 * HR
	VFL = F2 * VR
</pre></li></ul></div><p>As a rough guide, take F1 = 1.30 and F2 = 1.05 (see <a class="link" href="#framesizes" title="10. Computing Frame Sizes"> Computing Frame Sizes</a>.</p><p>Now take a particular sync frequency, HSF.  Given the assumptions just
presented, every value for the clock rate DCF already determines the
refresh rate RR, i.e. for every value of HSF there is a function RR(DCF).
This can be derived as follows.</p><p>The refresh rate is equal to the clock rate divided by the product of the
frame sizes:</p><pre class="screen">
	RR = DCF / (HFL * VFL)		(*)
</pre><p>On the other hand, the horizontal frame length is equal to the clock rate
divided by the horizontal sync frequency:</p><pre class="screen">
	HFL = DCF / HSF			(**)
</pre><p>VFL can be reduced to HFL be means of the two assumptions above:</p><pre class="screen">
	VFL = F2 * VR
	    = F2 * (HR / AR)
	    = (F2/F1) * HFL / AR	(***)
</pre><p>Inserting (**) and (***) into (*) we obtain:</p><pre class="screen">
	RR = DCF / ((F2/F1) * HFL**2 / AR)
	   = (F1/F2) * AR * DCF * (HSF/DCF)**2
	   = (F1/F2) * AR * HSF**2 / DCF
</pre><p>For fixed HSF, F1, F2 and AR, this is a hyperbola in our
diagram.  Drawing two such curves for minimum and maximum horizontal
sync frequencies we have obtained the two remaining boundaries of the
permitted region.</p><p>The straight lines crossing the capability region represent
particular resolutions. This is based on (*) and the second
assumption:</p><pre class="screen">
	RR = DCF / (HFL * VFL) = DCF / (F1 * HR * F2 * VR)
</pre><p>By drawing such lines for all resolutions one is interested in, one
can immediately read off the possible relations between resolution,
clock rate and refresh rate of which the monitor is capable. Note that
these lines do not depend on monitor properties, but they do depend on
the second assumption.</p><p>The <span class="application">modeplot</span> tool provides you with an easy way to
do this.  Do <span class="application">modeplot -?</span> to see its control
options. A typical invocation looks like this:</p><pre class="screen">
	modeplot -t "Swan SW617" -b 85 -v 50 90 -h 31 58
</pre><p>The -b option specifies video bandwidth; -v and -h set horizontal and
vertical sync frequency ranges.</p><p>When reading the output of <span class="application">modeplot</span>, always
bear in mind that it gives only an approximate description. For
example, it disregards limitations on HFL resulting from a minimum
required sync pulse width, and it can only be accurate as far as the
assumptions are.  It is therefore no substitute for a detailed
calculation (involving some black magic) as presented in <a class="link" href="#synth" title="12. Putting it All Together">Putting it All Together</a>. However, it should give
you a better feeling for what is possible and which tradeoffs are
involved.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="credits"></a>18. Credits</h2></div></div></div><p>The original ancestor of this document was by Chin Fang
