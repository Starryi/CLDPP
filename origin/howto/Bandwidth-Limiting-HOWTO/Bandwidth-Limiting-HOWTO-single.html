task and you don't have to read tons of books about routing or queuing algorithms.</P

>2.2. How does it work?</A
></H3
><P
>Squid is probably the most advanced HTTP proxy server available for Linux.
It can help us save bandwidth in two ways:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The first is a main characteristic of proxy servers -- they keep downloaded
web pages, pictures, and other objects in memory or on a disk. So, if two people are 
requesting the same web page, it isn't downloaded from the internet,
but from the local proxy. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Apart from normal caching, Squid has a special feature called delay
pools. Thanks to delay pools, it is possible to limit internet traffic in a
reasonable way, depending on so-called 'magic words', existing in any given
URL. For example, a magic word could be '.mp3', '.exe' or '.avi', etc.
Any distinct part of a URL (such as .avi) can be defined as a magic word.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>With that, we can tell the Squid to download these kinds of files at a
specified speed (in our example, it will be about 5 kbytes/s). If our
LAN users download files at the same time, they will be downloaded
at about 5 kbytes/s altogether, leaving remaining bandwidth for web pages,
e-mail, news, irc, etc.</P
><P
>Of course, the Internet is not only used for downloading files via web
pages (http or ftp). Later on, we will deal with limiting bandwidth for Napster,
Realaudio, and other possibilities.</P

>There can be two issues here.</P
><P
>One is when your SOCKS proxy is open relay, that means everyone can use it from any place in the world.
It is a security issue and you should check your SOCKS proxy configuration again - generally irc servers don't 
allow open relay SOCKS servers to connect to them.</P
><P
>If you are sure your SOCKS server isn't open relay, you may be still disallowed to connect to 
some of the irc servers - it's because mostly they just check if SOCKS server is running on port 1080 of a client
that is connecting. In that case just reconfigure your SOCKS to work on a different port. You will also have to
reconfigure your LAN software to use a proper SOCKS server and port.</P

>Generally it shouldn't occur. Sometimes, you can observe mass downloads, though you 
think you have blocked all ports Napster or Audiogalaxy uses. Well, there is always one more
port open for mass downloads. To find it, you can use IPTraf. As there can be possibly
thousands of such ports, it can be really hard task for you.
To make it easier, you can consider running your own SOCKS proxy - Napster, Audiogalaxy
and many programs can use SOCKS proxies, so it's much easier to deal with just one port, 
than to do so with thousands of possibilites (standard SOCKS port is 1080, if you run your 
own SOCKS proxy server, you will be able
to set it up differently, or run multiple instances of SOCKS proxy listening on
different ports). Don't forget to close all ports for traffic,
and leave open ports like 25 and 110 (SMTP and POP3), and other you think might be useful. You will
find a link to awesome Nylon socks proxy server at the end of this HOWTO.</P
