 Before taking a look at various configuration mechanisms for X servers and
 clients, it should be noted that the advent of Desktop Environments like 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> have become popular in part because they can
 control much of the user interaction configuration themselves with nice, 
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">user friendly</span>&#8221;</span> GUI controls. And in fact,
 the compliant applications that are part of the respective Desktops will be
 best configured through the Desktop's configuration tools, or the
 application's own GUI configuration methods. So, for instance,
 <span class="command"><strong>gtop</strong></span>, a <span class="application">GNOME</span> client
 application, is best configured via <span class="application">GNOME</span> or 
 <span class="command"><strong>gtop's</strong></span> own menus. But this is not true of all 
 <span class="application">X</span> applications. 

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="xresources"></a>4.1. X Resources</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The X server can store various configuration values for client programs
 so they are readily available when needed. If the application supports this,
 it will use these as defaults whenever that program is invoked. These are
 known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Resources</span>&#8221;</span>, and are often used to define user preferences
 on a per application basis for fonts, colors, screen placement (geometry) and
 various other attributes. This makes it easy to customize applications.

</p><p>
 Resources are specified as text strings (e.g. Netscape*blinkingEnabled:
 False) that can be read from disk in various places when
 <span class="application">X</span> is starting, or even interactively defined on the
 command line. Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion, with
 each object in the hierarchy identified by a class as well as an instance
 name. At the top level of the hierarchy is the class and instance name of the
 application itself. Typically, the class name of the application is the
 same as the program name, but with the first letter capitalized (e.g.  Vim or
 Emacs) although some programs that begin with the letter <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X</span>&#8221;</span>
 also capitalize the second letter for historical reasons (e.g. XTerm). 
 Each definition  will specify a class (or instance), with corresponding
 resource and value. Below this in the hierarchy are the various attributes
 that make up the definable aspects of the application. 

</p><p>
 Traditionally, most <span class="application">X</span> programs were  configured
 this way. This is not as true today with the advent of Desktop Environments
 which often have their own configuration mechanisms.

</p><p>
 As an example, say we prefer to run <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> with a blue
 background. So if we run it from the command line, we would run it as:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xterm -bg blue &amp;

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 If this is our preference, it would be easier to put this preference in a
 file somewhere, and have the system use our preference. That way whenever we
 started <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>, it would use our preferred value, and we 
 wouldn't need the command line options (unless as an override).

</p><p>
 The basic <span class="application">X</span> resource syntax is expressed like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 &lt;program&gt;&lt;binding&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;binding&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;...&gt;&lt;resource&gt;:&lt;value&gt;

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Which, in real life, typically looks something like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xterm*fontMenu*background: darkblue

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 It should be obvious what this does. The use of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221;</span> in the
 definition, is called a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">loose binding</span>&#8221;</span> and acts as a 
 wild-card. Meaning there may be gaps in the widget hierarchy. For instance:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xterm*background: darkblue

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This would also give a dark blue background for the <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>
 fontMenu, but also any other <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> properties that also have a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">background</span>&#8221;</span> attribute (e.g. window background, etc), no matter 
 where they may be in the widget hierarchy. Similarly:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 *background: darkblue

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This would define the background for any and all programs that support it -- not just
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>. Using a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.</span>&#8221;</span> in place of a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221;</span> would be more precise, and will not allow for wild-card gaps
 in the hierarchy. Also, the application must support the particular widget 
 attribute. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Background</span>&#8221;</span> is a fairly safe bet, but many
 applications will have more specialized resources that are not so obvious. It
 is best to check local documentation (man pages, etc), or see if an
 application has an included examples. For instance, <span class="command"><strong>Netscape</strong></span> 
 generally comes with an <code class="filename">Netscape.ad</code> file that has an extensive 
 set of resource definitions that can be customized.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">X</span> resources are typically stored in more than one
 place (see below) and are processed by the <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span> command (see man page).

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm673"></a>4.1.1. App Defaults</h4></div></div></div><p>
 One way of storing preferred application resources is via files named for the
 application in an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">app-defaults</span>&#8221;</span> directory. For instance, on my
 system, these are in <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/</code>,
 though this may vary according to options your vendor has chosen. This
 directory contains a number of files for such well known
 <span class="application">X</span> applications as <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>,
 <span class="command"><strong>xclock</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>xcalc</strong></span>,
 <span class="command"><strong>xload</strong></span>, and so on. All in all, it is a relatively small 
 number of applications in the overall scheme of things. So not all
 applications use this scheme. In fact, most do not.

</p><p>
 Each file will contain resource definitions for that application. The X
 server loads these by itself during start up. A brief example from 
 <code class="filename">XTerm-color</code>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 ! $XFree86$

 #include "XTerm"

 *VT100*colorMode: on
 *VT100*dynamicColors: on

 *VT100*color15: white
 *VT100*colorUL: yellow
 *VT100*colorBD: white

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This is mostly various color definitions. The application classname is not
 explicitly stated, and is assumed from the filename. So think of each line as
 starting: <code class="literal">XTerm-color*</code>. Also, notice at the top, the
 <code class="literal">#include "XTerm"</code> line, which <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">includes</span>&#8221;</span> the
 resource definitions for <span class="command"><strong>XTerm</strong></span>, a much longer file with a
 more diverse set of definitions. (Not included due to length, but worth
 looking at.) These files provide system wide defaults, and generally
 speaking, would not normally be edited by the user.
 
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm692"></a>4.1.2. Xdefaults</h4></div></div></div><p>
 Another common method of reading in resource preferences, is with an
 <code class="filename">Xdefaults</code> file. Or, sometimes the naming 
 scheme may be <code class="filename">Xresources</code> instead. This may exist as a
 system wide file, such as <code class="filename">/etc/X11/Xresources</code>. 
 Of course, the user is free to create a personal version in his home
 directory, e.g. <code class="filename">~/.Xdefaults</code>. The user's version will 
 over-ride any system wide settings, and will remain after system upgrades. 
 Obviously, this is the place to put your own preferences.

</p><p>
 <code class="filename">Xresources</code> files are read into the resource database
 with the <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span> command. Example:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This can be done interactively at the command line, or placed in a script and
 run automatically as the <span class="application">X</span> session is started. In
 the case of system wide files, this should be taken care of by the vendor
 supplied start up scripts. Generally, such scripts will also check the user's
 home directory as well (see the <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> example above).
 So probably all that need be done, is to create the file with a text editor.

</p><p>
 Here's an example to illustrate a very few of the many things that might
 be done with an <code class="filename">.Xdefaults</code> file:

 Hopefully, these few examples will give you some ideas to build on.
 <span class="application">X</span> does not need to be restarted if
 <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span> is used interactively from the command line after
 making changes. The effects are immediate.

</p><p>
 Resources are sometimes available also as command line options. See below. 
 Command line options will over-ride any existing resource definitions.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm715"></a>4.2. xmodmap, the Keyboard and Mice</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The keyboard and mouse, as well as other possible input devices, are defined
 in <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> (or <code class="filename">XF86Config-4</code>).
 There is a keyboard layout that is defined based on the preferred language:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "Keyboard0"
	Driver      "keyboard"
	Option      "XkbLayout"	"us"
 EndSection

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This gives us our default keyboard layout. Valid layout labels are listed in
 <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols</code>. Also, the
 <span class="command"><strong>setxkbmap</strong></span> utility can be used to change this
 interactively.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">X</span> is highly customizable, and we can modify the
 keyboard and mouse pointer mappings to suit our own preferences. The utility
 to do this is <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> (see man page). You don't like where
 the capslock key is? So move it ;-)

</p><p>
 Like <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> can be run from the
 command line. Or, preferred settings can be stored in a file. Typically this
 is <code class="filename">~/.Xmodmap</code>, or similar. If your
 <span class="application">X</span> start up files don't parse this, then edit as
 appropriate so that they do (probably from <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code> or
 <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code>).

</p><p>
 You can view your current key and mouse mappings with: <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap -pk
 -pp |less</strong></span>. This will print out all active <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">keycode</span>&#8221;</span>
 values, with corresponding <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">keysym</span>&#8221;</span> values, and any keysym names
 that <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> knows about (e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">BackSpace</span>&#8221;</span>).
 And should also give you an idea of how <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span>
 understands key and mouse events. There are two keysyms per keycode. The
 second is the shifted value. XFree86's <span class="command"><strong>xev</strong></span> utility can be
 used to dump a lot of information on key-presses and mouse events
 interactively. Pay attention to the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">keycode</span>&#8221;</span> value. That is
 what you will need to know in order to re-map.

</p><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> is often used to make minor keyboard adjustments,
 like proper Backspace/Delete mapping. Or can be used make major adjustments
 such as for international mappings. You can only re-map keys and mouse events
 -- you cannot assign macros to key events (your Window Manager or Desktop
 might have some of this functionality).

</p><p>
 A nice discussion of 
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Intkeyb/index.html" target="_top">setting up international keyboards
</a>.
 
Also, 
<a class="ulink" href="http://google.com/linux" target="_top">Google search</a> 
 will turn up many creative examples.

</p><p>
 The man page has many brief examples of various usages. Here is what an 
 one hypothetical <code class="filename">~/.Xmodmap</code> might look like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 ! /home/hal/.Xmodmap, last change 10/03/01
 !
 ! Force backspace to 22 and Delete to 111
 keycode 22 = BackSpace
 keycode 111 = Delete
 !
 ! My keyboard handles right and left Alt differently. Make the 
 ! Right act like the Left to avoid digital gymnastics.
 keycode 63 = Alt_L
 keycode 113 = Meta_L
 !
 ! Hard-code the keypad to numeric values as if numlock is always on 
 ! since I never use it for anything else.
 keycode 79=7
 keycode 80=8
 keycode 81=9
 keycode 83=4
 keycode 84=5
 keycode 85=6
 keycode 87=1
 keycode 88=2
 keycode 89=3
 keycode 90=0
 keycode 91=period
 keycode 86 = plus
 ! deactivate Num_Lock key since we don't need it now.
 keycode 77 =
 !
 ! My capslock is next to tab. I hit it by mistake sometimes, 
 ! and don't use it anyway. So make capslock act like Tab.
 keycode 66 = Tab
 clear lock
 !
 ! Reverse mouse buttons for left-handed people
 pointer = 3 2 1

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 As with many XFree86 files, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">!</span>&#8221;</span> represents a comment. 
 Another possible use, is to redefine those annoying <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Windows</span>&#8221;</span>
 keys to something useful. Hopefully this gives an idea of some things one
 might want to do to make the keyboard more agreeable to us.

</p><p>
 Speaking of the <code class="literal">Numlock</code> key, <span class="application">X</span>
 will typically disable this when it starts up. No matter how you have the
 BIOS set up, or Linux set up before <span class="application">X</span> starts. So the
 trick above is one way. There is also a utility available as either
 <span class="application">numlockx</span>, or
 <span class="application">setnumlock</span>, that can be found on the &#8217;Net, if
 your distribution does not include one or the other. This can be put in a
 start up file to turn <code class="literal">Numlock</code> on automatically if you would
 prefer.

</p><p>
 Window Managers and Desktop Environments will also allow customization of the
 keyboard and mouse (as long as it is recognized correctly by
 <span class="application">X</span>). This may be an easier way to configure certain 
 customizations.

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm765"></a>4.2.1. Special Key Mappings</h4></div></div></div><p>
 There are several special key mappings traditionally used in
 XFree86.

</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>BackSpace</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
     Will kill the <span class="application">X</span> server process in an orderly
     fashion. This is a quick, easy, legitimate way to restart
     <span class="application">X</span>. Note it does not restart the display
     manager (if used) &#8212; just <span class="application">X</span> itself.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    
where <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> 
corresponds to a valid <acronym class="acronym">TTY</acronym> number
    (typically 1&#8211;6). 
This is typically used to jump to a text console login,
    while <span class="application">X</span> remains running. To get back to
    <span class="application">X</span>, 
press 
<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></strong></span>. In this
    case, <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> 
represents one plus the last <acronym class="acronym">TTY</acronym> 
(e.g. <span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F7</strong></span> if
    there are six available <acronym class="acronym">TTY</acronym>&#8217;s). 
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>+</strong></span> 
and <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>-</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    That is the plus and minus keys on
    the keypad. This will cycle through any existing valid screen resolution 
    modes, e.g. 1024×768 &#8594; 600×800. Note the actual screen
    size is the same &#8212; just the view and resolution changes. 
Not all that
    useful for most purposes. You cannot permanently change the screen 
    resolution without restarting <span class="application">X</span>.
    
   </p></dd></dl></div><p>
 It's possible your Window Manager, Desktop Environment or other system
 component may trap these, and alter the standard behavior. In addition, the
 <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Delete</strong></span> may be trapped as well. This should shut
 <span class="application">X</span> (and the system) down orderly, if it is
 available.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm822"></a>4.2.2. Mice and Pointers</h4></div></div></div><p>
  As mentioned, Linux and Unix make heavy use of three mouse buttons. If a
  mouse only has two buttons, then the third (i.e. the middle) button can
  be simulated by pressing both buttons simultaneously. This is a
  configuration option set in <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> as the 
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Emulate3Buttons</span>&#8221;</span> directive:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "Mouse0"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
	Option      "Protocol" "PS/2"
	Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "on"
 EndSection

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 When all is said and done, a third button is quite handy and I would personally recommend
 having one. On wheeled mice, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">wheel</span>&#8221;</span> acts as the third
 button, if pressed. Many standard wheel mice seem to work with the
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">IMPS/2</span>&#8221;</span> protocol option.

</p><p>
 Specifically, the third button (middle) is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">paste</span>&#8221;</span> button in
 virtually all Linux applications. Copy and paste works a little different in
 Linux. The left button is the copy button. Just hold it down, and drag over
 text. It is automatically copied to the <span class="application">X</span>
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">clipboard</span>&#8221;</span>. Then, the middle button will paste from there. A
 very simple process. A double-click should copy individual words, and a
 triple-click individual lines of text. If for some reason, this does not
 work, it is either a poorly implemented application, or a bug of some kind.
 Some older versions of <span class="application">Netscape</span> were not
 consistent about this, for instance. To paste from the keyboard, this should 
 be shift+insert.

</p><p>
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Drag and Drop</span>&#8221;</span> is not natively supported by
 <span class="application">X</span> itself. But, is implemented by some toolkits and
 Desktop Environments. One should not expect this to work with non-compliant
 applications (i.e non-<span class="application">KDE</span> aware applications in 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> for example).

 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> is yet another XFree86 utility to set user
 preferences. <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> is a bit of a catch-all and is used 
 to change various, unrelated X server settings. Mostly this is a command 
 line way of configuring some of the same things that are defined in 
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> (but not everything!).

</p><p>
 Common usages of <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> are to set DPMS on or off and
 preferred intervals, to dynamically change the FontPath or re-read it, to
 control keyboard LEDs, to adjust mouse (or other pointer) movement speed,
 set keyboard <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">autorepeat</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">repeat</span>&#8221;</span> rates, and
 to control <span class="application">X's</span> built in screen blanking. See the
 man page, of course, for detailed explanations, and other
 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> usages.

</p><p>
 Again, <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> can be used interactively from the command
 line. But most often preferred settings are stored in one of the start up 
 configuration files, like <code class="filename">.xinitrc</code> or
 <code class="filename">.xsession</code>. A very brief example:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 # Turn off screen blanking
 xset s off
 
 # Enable DPMS energy saving
 xset +dpms
 
 # Tweak the rodent
 xset m 30/10 4
 
 # Speed up keyboard
 xset r rate 200 40

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Your desktop may have a GUI front-end for <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span>.
