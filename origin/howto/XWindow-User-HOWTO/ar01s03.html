 Starting an <span class="application">X</span> session is typically done in one of
 two ways: the <span class="application">X</span> session is started via a display
 manager (like <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>), and the user logs in at a GUI screen.
 Or, the user starts <span class="application">X</span> manually after logging in to
 a text console. The latter is typically done with the
 <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> command, which is a simple shell script wrapper
 for <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. <span class="application">X</span> runs with root
 privileges in either case, since it needs raw access to hardware devices.

</p><p>
 Typically, which method is used, is determined by the system 
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">runlevel</span>&#8221;</span>. The default runlevel to launch at boot is
 generally set in <code class="filename">/etc/inittab</code> on Linux: 

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 # Run xdm in runlevel 5
 x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/xdm -nodaemon

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 That would start <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>, and thus
 <span class="application">X</span>, at runlevel 5. It will <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">respawn</span>&#8221;</span>,
 if it dies or is stopped for any reason. You can also use the
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="command"><strong>init</strong></span></span>&#8221;</span> command to change runlevels without
 rebooting (see man page).

</p><p>
 Let's look briefly at both approaches, and then some additional configuration 
 to set up the user's working environment.

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm357"></a>3.1. startx</h3></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> will start <span class="application">X</span> by first
 invoking <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. By itself, this would put you at a blank,
 fuzzy looking, bare-bones desktop with no Window Manager loaded.
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> basically takes two sets of command line
 arguments: client specifications (programs to run, etc), and server
 specifications (X server options), separated by <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">--</span>&#8221;</span>. If no
 client program is specified on the command line, <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>
 will look for a <code class="filename">.xinitrc</code> file in the user's home
 directory, to run as a shell script. If found, this then would in turn run
 whatever user specified commands to set up the environment, or launch
 programs that the file contained. If this file does not exist,
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> will use the following initial command:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
 xterm -geometry +1+1 -n login -display :0
 
 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 If no <code class="filename">.xserverrc</code> is found in the user's home directory, 
 <span class="application">X</span> itself will be started with the following command:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 X :0

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 As you see, this is not overly helpful as it just launches one
 <span class="application">xterm</span>. The <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>
 shell wrapper provides additional functionality and flexibility to 
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> will invoke 
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> for us, and provide some simple configuration
 options as well. You can also issue commands such as the following, for
 instance:
 
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
 startx -- -dpi 100 -depth 16   #force X to 100 dots per inch
                                #and colordepth of 16 (X v4 syntax)
 
 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Anything after the double dashes are passed as arguments directly to the X
 server via <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. In this example, you can force
 <span class="application">X</span> to the resolution of your preference, and still
 have it use the configuration files we will cover later in this document. See
 the Xserver man page for more command line options.

</p><p>
 Instead of issuing the same command line every time, it is easier to use the
 configuration files to store this type of information for us.

</p><p>
 If you take a look at the <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> script
 (<code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/bin/startx</code> on my system), you see it uses
 two default configuration files to help set up the
 <span class="application">X</span> environment: <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> and
 <code class="filename">xserverrc</code>. It looks first in
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xinit/</code>, for the system wide files. It then
 checks the user's home directory for similar files, which will take
 precedence if found. Note that the latter are Unix style <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">dot</span>&#8221;</span> files
 (e.g. <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>), and are executable shell scripts.

</p><p>
 You normally would not want to edit the system wide files, but you can freely
 copy these to your home directory as a starting point, or just start from
 scratch. As you can tell by the names, one helps set up the X server, and one
 sets up <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> by executing commands, preparing the
 environment and possibly starting client programs like
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> or a Window Manager (yes, it's a client too).

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm399"></a>3.1.1. xserverrc</h4></div></div></div><p>
 As with all XFree86 configuration files, this is a plain text file, and is
 usually a simple, one line statement to start the X server. It can include
 any valid command line options supported by your <span class="application">X</span>
 installation. If you always start <span class="application">X</span> with your own
 options, this should be easier than typing the options each time. One
 possible <code class="filename">~/.xserverrc</code>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 exec X :0 -dpi 100 -nolisten tcp

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This will start <span class="application">X</span> on display :0, the first
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>, at a dots-per-inch resolution of 100, and disables
 TCP connections. See the Xserver man page for other valid options. This is
 just an example.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm410"></a>3.1.2. xinitrc</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> is used to set up a suitable
 <span class="application">X</span> environment, and to launch other programs, a.k.a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">clients</span>&#8221;</span> that we may want available as soon as
 <span class="application">X</span> is started. You likely have a system wide
 <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> to start a predefined set off programs. To
 customize this, create your own in your home directory. Name it
 <code class="filename">.xinitrc</code>, make sure it is an executable script, and
 <span class="command"><strong>chmod +x</strong></span>. An example (slightly modified from the original
 on my system):

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 Briefly, what this script does, is set up our working environment, with
 <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> (keyboard) and <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span>
 (application resource settings). More on these below.  Then the shell variable
 <code class="literal">$BROWSER</code> is set for a GUI environment (Netscape in this
 example) so that any applications that might expect this, have a reasonable
 choice available. Then the presence of the file <code class="filename">Xclients</code>
 is checked, both as a system wide file and in the user's home directory. In
 this particular example, this is where any client applications are to be
 started, including a Window Manager (see below). These could just have as
 easily been started here if we had wanted to. If an
 <code class="filename">Xclients</code> file can't be found, then a Window Manager is
 started for us. Either <span class="command"><strong>fvwm</strong></span>, if available, or XFree86's
 minimalist <span class="command"><strong>twm</strong></span> if not. If for some reason, neither of
 these can be started, the script would exit, and <span class="application">X</span>
 would fail to start.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm431"></a>3.1.3. Xclients</h4></div></div></div><p>
 Everything up to this point has followed pretty much a standard and
 predictable sequence of events. To summarize, we have invoked
 <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>, which in turn invoked <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>, 
 which has parsed <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> for initial settings. Most
 Linuxes should follow this same sequence, though the various values and
 settings may differ.

</p><p>
 We now are at the last link in the chain where the user normally would 
 specify his or her preferences, including the Window Manager and/or 
 desktop environment to be used. The system will provide sane, though possibly
 uninteresting, defaults if the user has not done so. Presumably, this is why
 you are here ;-)

</p><p>
 The Window Manager, or desktop environment, is typically the last application
 started. If you want other programs (like <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>) started,
 they should be started before the Window Manager and
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>&#8221;</span> with an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">&amp;</span>&#8221;</span>. This can all be
 done in the user's <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>. Or as in the above
 example, the actual applications are started from yet another script. Let's
 look at one short, hypothetical such script, <code class="filename">.Xclients</code>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.Xclients, start my programs.

xset s off s noblank
xset m 30/10 4
xset r rate 200 40

xscreensaver &amp; 
rxvt -geometry 80x50-50+150 &amp;

echo Starting Window Manager...

if [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker ]; then
  echo `date`: Trying /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
  exec /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker &gt;&gt; ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
fi 

echo `date`: Failed, trying fvwm... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# let's try regular fvwm (AnotherLevel doesn't work with fvwm1).
if [ -n "$(type -path fvwm)" ]; then
  # if this works, we stop here
  exec fvwm &gt;&gt; ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
fi

echo `date`: Failed, trying twm... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# wow, fvwm isn't here either ... 
# use twm as a last resort.
exec twm &gt;&gt; ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# Dead in the water here, X will exit as well, sigh...
echo `date`: Unable to start a Window Manager ... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# eof

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This really isn't so different than what <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> was
 doing at all. We added a few wrinkles, including starting a screen saver, a
 different terminal emulator that this user prefers (<span class="command"><strong>rxvt</strong></span>),
 with even more setting up of the environment (monitor, mouse and keyboard) using
 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> this time, and a different Window Manager than was
 available with the system defaults. This is in the user's home directory, so
 it will not be overwritten during upgrades too.

</p><p>
 Actually, <span class="application">X</span> has already started at this point, and
 we are just putting the finishing touches on the configuration. Notice the
 Window Managers are not <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>&#8221;</span> with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">&amp;</span>&#8221;</span>
 here. This is important! Something has to run in the foreground, or
 <span class="application">X</span> will exit. We didn't start a desktop environment
 in this example, like <span class="application">KDE</span> or
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>, but if we did, this final application
 would have to be <span class="command"><strong>gnome-session</strong></span> or
 <span class="command"><strong>startkde</strong></span> instead. Since we are rolling our own here, if we
 wanted to change Window Managers, all we have to do is edit this file, and
 restart <span class="application">X</span>. Vendor supplied configurations may be
 more complex than this, but the same principles apply.

</p><p>
 As an afterword, do not think that any initial client applications
 <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be started as we've done here. This is how it has
 been traditionally done, and some may prefer this approach. Most window
 managers have their own built-in ways to start initial programs, as do 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> and <span class="application">GNOME</span>. See 
 the respective documentation.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm464"></a>3.2. Display Managers</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The other, more common, approach is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">GUI log-in</span>&#8221;</span>, where
 <span class="application">X</span> is running before log-in. This is done with the
 help of a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display manager</span>&#8221;</span>, of which there are various
 implementations. XFree86 includes <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span> (X Display Manager)
 for this purpose, though your distribution may use one of the others such as
 <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> (<span class="application">GNOME</span>) or <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span>
 (<span class="application">KDE</span>).

</p><p>
 Display managers really do much more than enable GUI style log-ins. They 
 are also used to manage local as well as remote <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> on a
 network. We shall not get into details on this here, but it is nicely covered in
 the <em class="citetitle">Remote X Apps Mini HOWTO</em> and the <em class="citetitle">XDMCP
 HOWTO</em> (see the <a class="link" href="ar01s10.html#links" title="10.2. Links and other References">links section</a>). For
 our purposes here, they provide similar services to <span class="command"><strong>getty</strong></span>
 and <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span>, which allow users to log into a system and
 start their default shell, but in a GUI environment. 

</p><p>
 Here is an example of a more advanced usage of what else a display manager
 might be used for, from Diego Zamboni:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
 I have two X sessions running with different resolutions. I switch between
 them depending on whether my laptop is connected to an external monitor or
 using its own LCD display.

</p><p>
 Here's my <code class="filename">/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> file that initiates 
 both displays:
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

</p><p>
 Then I have <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">1024x768</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">1600x1200</span>&#8221;</span> defined as
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">server layouts</span>&#8221;</span> in my

 Note the use of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Identifiers</span>&#8221;</span> here. Diego is starting two
 separate <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> here. Then he can choose which one he

</p><p>
 Most display managers are derived from XFree86's venerable
 <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>, and add their own enhancements. Let's look at the
 most popular ones briefly. 

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm501"></a>3.2.1. xdm</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span> can be configured with configuration files located in
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/</code>,
 <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm</code>, or similar locations depending
 on your system. These are system wide files. The file
 <code class="filename">xdm-config</code> is the main configuration file, and mostly
 describes where to find secondary configuration files:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 ! $XConsortium: xdm-conf.cpp /main/3 1996/01/15 15:17:26 gildea $
 DisplayManager.errorLogFile:	/var/log/xdm-errors

 DisplayManager.accessFile:	/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess

 ! X terminals will be configured that way, so by default

 DisplayManager.requestPort:	0

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">!</span>&#8221;</span> denotes comments. The command that starts the X server
 is in <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> in this particular example
 as defined by <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">DisplayManager.servers</span>&#8221;</span>, and is the equivalent to
 <code class="filename">xserverrc</code> that was used for <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> X
 server start up commands, but the syntax is slightly different here. The
 contents of <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> on my system are simply:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X 

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This starts <span class="application">X</span> on the first local display
 (designated by 0). Any special command line arguments that you want to add go
 here at the end.

</p><p>
 Below is a sample <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</code> which is
 used to configure the log-in screen only. Notice that we're using a shell
 script here, and it's calling <span class="command"><strong>xv</strong></span> (a graphics display
 program) to set the background to a nice image (instead of the boring black
 and white background pattern), and if that fails,
 <span class="command"><strong>xsetroot</strong></span> is then invoked to at least try to set the
 background to a nicer blue color. This does not configure the login widget
 itself -- just other things that might be wanted on the screen during login.

 As you can see this is using helvetica as the preferred font, with different
 point sizes and dots per inch depending on the screen size. This is
 customizable to suit individual needs. (See below for more on understanding X
 font naming conventions.) Various other aspects can similarly be configured.

</p><p>
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</code> is the rough equivalent to
 <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> for <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>. It will similarly
 set up a default environment for keyboard, etc. And can also start either 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> or <span class="application">GNOME</span>, and other
 <span class="application">X</span> client programs. This is the system wide
 configuration file. It should also check the user's home directory for
 <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code>, and possibly
 <code class="filename">~/.Xclients</code>, which would contain the user's preferred
 environment and start up programs, just as <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>
 did with <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>. Again, the files in a user's home
 directory may be created or modified by the user any time and must be
 executable shell scripts.

</p><p>
 We shall not include an <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code> example here, since it
 would be very similar to the <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code> and 
 <code class="filename">~/.Xclients</code> examples above.

</p><p>
 We've looked only briefly at the main <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span> configuration files.
 Be sure to read the man page, and look at what is installed locally, for more 
 information. Let's look now at <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span>. 
 We'll just highlight significant differences, since they essentially provide
 the same functionality.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm553"></a>3.2.2. gdm</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> is the default display manager for
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>. <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> was written 
 from scratch, but functions similarly to <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>. The main
 configuration file is <code class="filename">gdm.conf</code>, typically located as
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</code>. This is quite different looking
 than <code class="filename">xdm-config</code>. Comments are denoted with a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">#</span>&#8221;</span>, and the file has sections, with section headers enclosed
 in square brackets. The command to start <span class="application">X</span> is in
 the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[servers]</span>&#8221;</span> section:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 [servers]
 0=/usr/bin/X11/X
 #1=/usr/bin/X11/X

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Notice this has potentially two displays set up, but the second one is
 commented out. Add any additional <span class="application">X</span> startup
 options here, e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">-dpi 100</span>&#8221;</span>. The log-in screen and log-in
 widget are configured in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[greeter]</span>&#8221;</span> section. 

</p><p>
 Start up clients and programs are determined by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">SessionDir</span>&#8221;</span>
 statement in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[daemon]</span>&#8221;</span> section. On my installation, this
 points to <code class="filename">/etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/</code>, which contains several
 short scripts. If I look at my <code class="filename">Default</code> script, it
 actually executes <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</code>, which in turn
 would execute <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code>, if present. So at this final 
 stage, <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> acts very much like <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">GNOME</span> includes the <span class="command"><strong>gdmconfig</strong></span>
 utility to control many aspects of <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> behavior. 

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm585"></a>3.2.3. kdm</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> is the display manager from <span class="application">KDE</span>. 
 The main configuration file for <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> is
 <code class="filename">kdmrc</code> and is typically installed
 as <code class="filename">/etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc</code>. As is the case with
 <code class="filename">gdm.conf</code>, <code class="filename">kdmrc</code> uses
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">#</span>&#8221;</span> for comments, and has sections with section headers in
 similar square brackets. <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> configuration can also be
 edited with the <span class="command"><strong>kcontrol</strong></span> utility.

</p><p>
 The visible desktop is configured in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[Desktop*]</span>&#8221;</span>
 section(s), and by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Setup</span>&#8221;</span> directive which should point to a
 file like <code class="filename">/usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup</code> or 
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</code>. This will accomplish the same
 thing as <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>'s <code class="filename">Xsetup_0</code> does: namely
 running any programs the user might want such as <span class="command"><strong>xconsole</strong></span>.

</p><p>
 The command to launch the X server is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Xservers</span>&#8221;</span> directive
 in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[General]</span>&#8221;</span>. Again, this should point to a file such as 
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code>, and uses the same syntax as
 <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X 

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Any command line options for the X server, go here.

</p><p>
 The login widget itself is configured in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[X-*-Greeter]</span>&#8221;</span>
 section(s). Compiled in defaults are used if the user does not specify any.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">KDE</span> includes the <span class="command"><strong>kdmdesktop</strong></span>
 utility to control some aspects of <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> behavior, mostly 
 just the login background.
