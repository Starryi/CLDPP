 We shall not delve into configuring Window Manager's and Desktop Environments.
 There is just too much to try to cover in one document. It is important to
 realize that the two are not the same. There are many, many Window Managers
 available. 
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1022"></a>6.1. Window Managers</h3></div></div></div><p>
 Window Managers are highly configurable. Many aspects of user interaction can 
 be controlled by the Window Manager.

</p><p>
 Some of the most popular Window Managers:

 There are many, many lesser known ones as well.

 has an updated list of Window Managers, and related information.
 There is always <a class="ulink" href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_top">freshmeat</a> too.

 <span class="application">GNOME</span> and <span class="application">KDE</span>
 both have their default Window Manager, but support other, compliant Window
 Managers as well. Your distribution probably has included at least several.
 Try them all if you don't already have a favorite. Your distribution probably
 also has a method of switching dynamically between Window Managers (and Desktop
 Environments too).

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1065"></a>6.2. Desktop Environments</h3></div></div></div><p>
 Desktop Environments are not really new, but their popularity has increased
 with advent of the two big names: <span class="application">KDE</span> and
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>. To a certain extent, the Desktop
 Environment functionality overlaps the Window Manager's. They both can be
 responsible for the root window background, root window menu, icons,
 taskbars, etc. Generally speaking, if a Desktop Environment is running, it is
 controlling these aspects. That is the main idea behind them -- to integrate
 the various components into a cohesive, consistent whole. Desktop
 Environments also add some interoperability and ease-of-use features that a
 simple Window Manager cannot. 
</p><p>
 Oh, another point: Desktop Environments also try to do as much
 <span class="application">X</span> session configuration as possible. Any of their
 compliant clients will more than likely be configured by the Desktop, or have
 it's own configuration that conforms to the Desktop's style. This is at
 least partly to avoid much of the seemingly helter-skelter text file
 configuration we looked at in the above sections, and make life a little
 easier for the user.

</p><p>
 There is a trade-off in this additional functionality, and that is that it
 takes memory and system resources to oversee all this. If you have plenty of
 memory and a fast computer, this is no problem. But in low memory situations,
 this can cause a slowdown (see the <a class="link" href="ar01s09.html" title="9. Performance Considerations">performance
 section</a> below). 64M of RAM is probably borderline with either 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> or <span class="application">GNOME</span>.

</p><p>
 So do you need a Desktop Environment? That is up to the user. They are
 certainly not required to run <span class="application">X</span>, but do add
 features that many users want or expect in a GUI. Which one is better? Ah,
 but that is up to you to decide!

</p><p>
 <span class="application">KDE</span> has been around longer than
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>, and some would say maybe a little more
 mature. <span class="application">KDE</span> is based on the QT widget toolkit. A
 quote from the <a class="ulink" href="http://kde.org" target="_top">KDE home page</a>:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p> 
  KDE is a powerful Open Source graphical desktop environment for Unix
  workstations.  It combines ease of use, contemporary functionality, and
  outstanding graphical design with the technological superiority of the Unix
  operating system.
</p><p>
 KDE is a mature desktop suite providing a solid basis to an ever growing
 number of applications for Unix workstations.  KDE has developed a high
 quality development framework for Unix, which allows for the rapid and
 efficient creation of applications.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
 <span class="application">GNOME</span> is based on the GTK+ toolkit.
 And a quote from the <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org" target="_top">GNOME home page</a>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
 GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment. The GNOME project
 intends to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based entirely on free
 software. GNOME is part of the GNU project, and GNOME is part of the Open
 Source(tm) movement. The desktop will consist of small utilities and larger
 applications which share a consistent look and feel. GNOME uses GTK+ as the
 GUI toolkit for all GNOME-compliant applications.
 </p></blockquote></div><p>
 <span class="application">XFce</span> is a lighter weight, less featureful Desktop
 Environment that does not get as much attention as the others.
 <span class="application">XFce</span> is also based on the GTK+ toolkit. And a
 quote from the <a class="ulink" href="http://xfce.org" target="_top">XFce home page</a>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
  The XFce project was first started because I needed a simple, light and
  efficient environment for my Linux System.
 </p><p>
  I believe that the desktop environment should be made to increase user
  productivity. Therefore, the goal is keep most system resources for the
  applications, and not to consume all memory and CPU usage with the desktop
  environment.
 </p></blockquote></div><p>
 All these have their own extensive documentation. If you can't find what you
 need installed on your system, check the respective home pages.
