 The <span class="emphasis"><em>X Window System</em></span> is an advanced, graphical
 computing and network environment that was designed from the ground up as a
 multi-user system. <span class="application">X</span> was first released in 1984.
 If you are not familiar with the basic concepts surrounding
 <span class="application">X</span> and it's related components, you should first
 read the <em class="citetitle">X Window System Architecture Overview HOWTO</em>, <a class="ulink" href="http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html</a>,
 to get an idea of how the various pieces fit together. There is also 
 an attempt to define to various <span class="application">X</span> related
 terminology in the <a class="link" href="#terms" title="10.1. Terminology and Usage">Appendix</a>, if concepts such 
 as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X clients</span>&#8221;</span> in this context are
 confusing to you.

</p><p>
 This document will address basic X Window configuration and usage on Linux. We will
 also look at how <span class="application">X</span> is commonly started in Linux,
 and how the start up can be configured, and related issues. We will
 <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> examine Window Manager (e.g.
 <span class="application">fvwm</span>), or Desktop Environment
 (<span class="application">KDE</span> and <span class="application">GNOME</span>)
 configuration. There are just too many variables there, and the pace of
 change moves too quickly. Of course, to a large extent the user interacts
 more directly with these components than the X server itself, so additional
 reading would be worthwhile. Check your locally installed documentation, and
 the respective home pages for more information.

</p><p>
 Some other important points to remember here:

</p><p>
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="application">X</span> is a client-server, multi-user system in
    every respect, and not just a GUI.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="application">X</span> is not integrated into the operating system,
   and rides on top of it, like other servers.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="application">X</span> is an open standard, and runs on many platforms. 
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    What you actually see on the screen is the result of various components,
    all working together: operating system, <span class="application">X</span>,
    Window Manager, and optionally, a desktop environment like
    <span class="application">GNOME</span> or <span class="application">KDE</span>. These
    are all <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">plug and play</span>&#8221;</span> components, meaning you can
    interchange an individual component without touching the other components.
    
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Each of the various components has its own configuration. This makes for a
    very flexible, and potentially very robust, system. It also adds 
    complexity.
  </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
 The discussion here will be limited to <span class="application">X</span> as
 implemented by <a class="ulink" href="http://xfree86.org" target="_top">The XFree86 Project,
 Inc.</a> on Linux. There are other implementations, including
 commercial ones. XFree86 v4.x has been out for some time now, so we will be
 assuming that version. Much of the discussion applies to the previous 3.x
 version as well, but there are some occasional differences.

</p><p>
 It is also worth noting that there are conceivably many ways to start
 <span class="application">X</span>, and to set up a Linux system. We will focus on
 the common methods found in Linux distributions. Also, vendors may vary on
 where they put configuration files, and how they name them. Keep this in mind
 if you see such discrepancies in this document. If this is a problem, your
 vendor surely has their own documentation. And as always, hopefully the man
 pages will conform to your installation.

</p><p>
 Also, we will look at various configuration files in the following sections.
 These are all plain text files, and can be edited with your favorite editor.
 Always make a backup copy before editing important files, in case Murphy pays
 a visit (e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cp /etc/X11/XF86Config-4  /etc/X11/XF86Config-4.bak</span>&#8221;</span>).

The <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO.html" target="_top">current official version of this HOWTO </a>
may be found at the Linux Documentation Project.
</p><p>
 v3.1: This is just some small, minor updates. Include link 
 to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/" target="_top">http://www.plig.org/xwinman/</a>
 as a good resource for shopping Window Managers. Add link for fluxbox, 
 a Window Manager with Tabbed windows. And add a brief section on improving 
 network performance. Verify links all work.
</p><p>
 v3.0: This is a major rewrite with several new sections. Some
 sections were removed, with the focus more now on just
 <span class="application">X</span> itself (and not clients like Window Managers).
 New maintainer too :-)
</p><p>
 v2.0: includes corrections from Guus Bosch, Brian J.
 Miller, and myself, as well as lots of new updates and info.
</p><p>
 v1.4: include corrections and additions from Anthony J., and
 some very good security tips from Tomasz Motylewski.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm106"></a>1.2. To Do</h3></div></div></div><p>
 A rudimentary troubleshooting section. Probably for v3.2.

 I have assumed maintainership of this document because it was abandoned, and
 I had wanted to offer a suggested change. Well, to make a long story short,
 this led to a major re-write. You can help make this a better document by
 correcting inaccuracies, clarifying the unclear, and suggesting improvements.
 There is much about this topic I may not know, or not have explained well. Your
 help will improve this document and help other users. This document 
 <span class="emphasis"><em>needs</em></span> your help!
 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm117"></a>1.5. Acknowledgments</h3></div></div></div><p>
 Thanks to the XFree86 development team for their efforts in providing a
 robust and flexible GUI. And to the whole GNU/Linux and Open Source
 community for making it all possible.
 
</p><p>
 Also, the original author, Ray Brigleb.

</p><p>
 Various users on comp.os.linux.x that have helped in one way or another, 
 whether they know it or not.

 Virtually every Linux distribution comes with XFree86's
 <span class="application">X Window System</span> implementation. This project, of
 course, provides us the X server, but also includes an extensive suite of
 utilities and applications to help implement a fully functional GUI
 environment.

</p><p>
 In fact, the list would be just too long to list everything that
 comes with XFree86. In addition to the X server itself, here are a few of the
 noteworthy utilities:

 </td></tr></table><p>
 There are many more. We'll just touch on a few of these utilities here. But
 feel free to explore the others. Most should have their own man pages.

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm208"></a>2.1. Hardware</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The X server controls both input (keyboard, mouse, etc) and output (display,
 monitor) devices.

</p><p>
 Compatible hardware is a tough topic, since it is very much a moving target.
 We are forced here to avoid specifics, since this would surely change by the
 time you read this. And would be tediously lengthy anyway.

</p><p>
 So let's settle for some generalities. <span class="emphasis"><em>Most</em></span> PC type
 hardware is supported to one degree or another. Big help ;-)

</p><p>
 Rule of thumb: if it is a device that uses a long-standing, commonplace
 protocol (e.g. PS/2), it should be well supported. Conversely, if it is
 something relatively new, with  ground-breaking technology, the odds 
 are not as good. This is just the nature of the beast with open source 
 development versus manufacturers that cater more to the most popular
 platforms. Some manufacturers are more co-operative than others too.

</p><p>
 Now, some general guidelines:

</p><p>
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
     Monitors - This is easy. Linux does not really need to be compatible with
     the monitor per se. That is the job of the video card. Any monitor that
     your graphics card can drive should do fine. Including, flat panel 
     monitors.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Video cards - This is much tougher. The X server is determined by the 
     the chipset. Many, many are supported. But inevitably there are always 
     some newer cards, or even revised cards, that are not. And some may have
     better support and better optimization than others. Advanced
     features such as multi-headed displays, 3D, TV out, DRI, etc., have some
     support as well, though this should be researched first, as the support
     may be limited. Supported cards are listed: <a class="ulink" href="http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html" target="_top">http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html</a>.

   </p><p>
     Open source drivers are often developed incrementally. For instance, a
     particular card may work well for basic display purposes, but specialized 
     features such as 3D may come much later in the development cycle. This
     is a quite different development model than with proprietary drivers from 
     the manufacturer.

   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Keyboards -- Any standard PC type keyboard should do fine,
    including PS/2, USB and many infra-red devices. Probably many 
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">non-standard</span>&#8221;</span> ones too ;-)

   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Mice and other pointer devices -- Most should be supported including 
    PS/2, bus, serial, USB and many infra-red devices. Optical mice also. Unix
    has long preferred three button mice, though more buttons is supported as
    well. Many wheeled mice have X server support via the
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">IMPS/2</span>&#8221;</span> (IntelliMouse), or other specific protocols, though
    may require supplemental configuration for some individual applications.
    (See the <a class="link" href="#links" title="10.2. Links and other References">Links</a> section.)
   
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Laptops have their own unique set of problems since the hardware tends to
   be very specialized, and often different from what is commonly found on
   desktop style systems. <span class="application">X</span> is supported by many.
   Check for details at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux-laptop.net/" target="_top">http://www.linux-laptop.net/</a>.
  
  </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
 You can check the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">hardware compatibility list</span>&#8221;</span> at your
 distribution's web site too. This should give a very good idea of what 
 <span class="emphasis"><em>should work</em></span> with your release.

</p><p>
 Newer versions of XFree86 obviously will have better hardware support. If you
 are using an older Linux version and don't have full hardware support, see
 about upgrading XFree86. Check first to see if your distribution has updates 
 for your release.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm239"></a>2.2. XF86Config</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The primary configuration file for XFree86 is
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code>, which may exist on your system as
 <code class="filename">XF86Config-4</code> for XFree86 v4.x, or possibly other
 variations (see man page). It is typically located as
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>, though again, there may be
 variations in the path. If both a <code class="filename">XF86Config-4</code> 
 and <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> exist, XFree86 v4.x will use the former.
 This is a required file.

</p><p>
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> file defines hardware devices, and other
 critical components of the X server environment. 

</p><p>
 While this is a plain text file, and is editable, it is most often created
 during installation by whatever utility your vendor uses for this purpose. 
 XFree86 also includes the <span class="command"><strong>xf86config</strong></span> utility for this, 
 but many distributions have their own such utilities. These utilities can be
 run after installation if need be, to alter the configuration, or if new
 hardware is installed. Read your locally installed documentation first. If
 you attempt to hand edit this file, be sure to make a backup copy first since
 <span class="application">X</span> will not start if this file is not to its liking
 ;-)

</p><p>
 This file contains various <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sections</span>&#8221;</span>. Each section defines some
 fundamental aspect of XFree86, such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">InputDevice</span>&#8221;</span> (mouse,
 keyboard, joystick, etc), <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">monitor</span>&#8221;</span>, or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span>. The 
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> man page describes the sections and
 common values for each. Note that the values listed in the man page is not a
 comprehensive listing. There are many device specific <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">options</span>&#8221;</span>.
 Check <a class="ulink" href="http://xfree86.org" target="_top">http://xfree86.org</a> for notes
 and tips on your hardware.

</p><p>
 Yours may look quite different. This is just one possible configuration with
 gratuitous comments from Red Hat (and me), and is for a fairly ordinary set
 up. There is nothing exotic here like multiple screens or displays.

</p><p>
 It is beyond the scope of this document to explain this in detail. See the 
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> man page. Also, consider visiting 
 <a class="ulink" href="http://xfree86.org" target="_top">xfree86.org</a>
 and look for specific options that might apply to your card or other
 hardware.

</p><p>
 Just one quick note on the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Screen</span>&#8221;</span> section above. Notice there are
 three sub-sections, identified as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Display</span>&#8221;</span>. Each sub-section
 has a different <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Depth</span>&#8221;</span> specified, (a.k.a. ColorDepth). The
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modes</span>&#8221;</span> also vary somewhat according to the respective
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Depth</span>&#8221;</span> setting. The active <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Display</span>&#8221;</span> sub-section
 that will be used, is determined by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">DefaultDepth</span>&#8221;</span> setting 
 (unless over-ridden by command line options). The default in this example is
 defined as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">24</span>&#8221;</span>, so the first sub-section will be used. Also,
 the highest <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Mode</span>&#8221;</span> listed in this sub-section will be the default
 mode (resolution), which here is the first one listed. The first listed mode 
 also determines the viewable screen area, which can be smaller than the mode
 (resolution) itself. In which case, you would have a virtual desktop that is
 larger than the viewable screen. To have the viewable screen, and resolution 
 match, have the largest value as the first value listed for each
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Mode</span>&#8221;</span>.

</p><p>
 Another note on the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modes</span>&#8221;</span> here: what you see is the result of
 my choices during Red Hat's <span class="command"><strong>Xconfigurator's</strong></span> configuration. These 
 are standard resolutions, but do not have to be! This is only limited by what
 your hardware can support. And you don't have to use standard width x height 
 ratios either. Something like <code class="literal">1355x1112</code> is a valid setting (if
 your hardware supports it and it floats your boat!).

</p><p>
 The X server will reject any <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modes</span>&#8221;</span> it thinks are invalid. You
 can cycle through valid modes to change screen resolution with
 <code class="literal">Ctrl-Alt-+</code> and <code class="literal">Ctrl-Alt--</code> (that's the
 keypad plus and minus keys).

</p><p>
 In versions prior to v4.x, you would also see many <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modeline</span>&#8221;</span> 
 statements that attempted to define the monitor's capabilities. These
 statements would look something like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 # 1024x768 @ 100Hz, 80.21 kHz hsync
 Modeline "1024x768"  115.5  1024 1056 1248 1440  768  771  781  802 -HSync -VSync

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Explicit <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modeline</span>&#8221;</span> definitions are not required as of 4.x ;-)
 This sometimes required hand editing to get optimal values in earlier versions of 
 
XFree86, though is generally not necessary with v4.x. 
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">The XFree86 Video
 Timings HOWTO
</a>
 has a nice, but rather technical, explanation of this.

</p><p>
 If whatever configuration utility you are using, does not automatically
 recognize your video card or monitor specifications correctly, you are
 unlikely to get an optimal configuration. In such cases, you may have to
 manually supply the correct values. This should be available from your 
 owner's manual (you kept that, right?). Or, check the manufacturer's web site.

</p><p>
 Again, hand editing of this file is generally unnecessary. Should you decide
 this is indeed necessary, be careful. One small error may cause
 <span class="application">X</span> to fail. Any changes to this file will require
 restarting <span class="application">X</span> for the changes to take
 effect.

</p><p>
 Using somebody else's <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> file, is generally a
 bad idea since they are unlikely to have identical hardware.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm300"></a>2.3. xvidtune and Monitor Tuning</h3></div></div></div><p>
 You probably want to get the most out of your hardware. If
 <span class="application">X</span> isn't configured optimally, consider re-running
 your vendor's <span class="application">X</span> configuration utility and try to
 get better results. It is highly unlikely that you could hurt anything by
 experimenting. Most modern monitors now have safeguards that prevent a
 meltdown ;-)
 
</p><p>
 If you over-do it though <span class="application">X</span> may not be able to
 start. For this reason, I prefer to use the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">startx</span>&#8221;</span> way of
 starting <span class="application">X</span> (see below) while
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">experimenting</span>&#8221;</span>. This way if <span class="application">X</span>
 crashes, the display manager (GUI login) will not loop and cause you severe
 headaches. <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> just gracefully goes back to a text
 console screen, where an error message may be visible.

</p><p>
 Another way of tweaking monitor related settings is with XFree86's 
 <span class="command"><strong>xvidtune</strong></span> program. This is run interactively and can be
 used to adjust various settings (see man page). The simple dialog box has
 sliders and buttons that allow user input and adjustment. The top part has
 horizontal monitor settings on the left, and vertical settings on the right.
 The buttons just below the sliders can be used to adjust each.

</p><p>
 This is sometimes used to adjust the viewable screen area, such as to center
 it, or increase its size to fill the monitor's viewport. When
 <span class="command"><strong>xvidtune</strong></span> is launched, it defaults to the current settings.

</p><p>
 The bottom left corner has buttons that can <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Apply</span>&#8221;</span> new
 settings, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Test</span>&#8221;</span> new settings, or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Show</span>&#8221;</span> current
 settings (i.e. dump to screen), among other things. Any changes made here are
 not saved. If new settings are <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Applied</span>&#8221;</span>, it is just for
 the current session. Example output of <span class="command"><strong>xvidtune</strong></span>
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Show</span>&#8221;</span>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 Vendor: Unknown, Model: Unknown
 Num hsync: 1, Num vsync: 1
 hsync range 0:  30.00 -  70.00
 vsync range 0:  55.00 - 120.00
 "1400x1050"   122.00   1400 1488 1640 1880   1050 1052 1064 1082 +hsync +vsync

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 The last line is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modeline</span>&#8221;</span> being used to drive the current
 screen. See <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">The XFree86 Video
 Timings HOWTO
</a>, 
 for more on <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modelines</span>&#8221;</span>.


</p><p>
 You can test modifications, and apply them to the current session.
 For changes to be made permanent, they will have to be added manually to 
 the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Monitor</span>&#8221;</span> section of <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> (or
 <code class="filename">XF86Config-4</code> for v.4.x) with a text editor.

</p><p>
  <span class="command"><strong>xvidtune</strong></span> will dutifully warn of you of the hazards of
  playing with the monitor settings. It is unlikely you can hurt anything 
  with modern monitors. But it is best used to make minor adjustments. Use at
  your own risk!

</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="runningx"></a>3. Running X</h2></div></div></div><p>
 Starting an <span class="application">X</span> session is typically done in one of
 two ways: the <span class="application">X</span> session is started via a display
 manager (like <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>), and the user logs in at a GUI screen.
 Or, the user starts <span class="application">X</span> manually after logging in to
 a text console. The latter is typically done with the
 <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> command, which is a simple shell script wrapper
 for <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. <span class="application">X</span> runs with root
 privileges in either case, since it needs raw access to hardware devices.

</p><p>
 Typically, which method is used, is determined by the system 
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">runlevel</span>&#8221;</span>. The default runlevel to launch at boot is
 generally set in <code class="filename">/etc/inittab</code> on Linux: 

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 # Run xdm in runlevel 5
 x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/xdm -nodaemon

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 That would start <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>, and thus
 <span class="application">X</span>, at runlevel 5. It will <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">respawn</span>&#8221;</span>,
 if it dies or is stopped for any reason. You can also use the
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="command"><strong>init</strong></span></span>&#8221;</span> command to change runlevels without
 rebooting (see man page).

</p><p>
 Let's look briefly at both approaches, and then some additional configuration 
 to set up the user's working environment.

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm357"></a>3.1. startx</h3></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> will start <span class="application">X</span> by first
 invoking <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. By itself, this would put you at a blank,
 fuzzy looking, bare-bones desktop with no Window Manager loaded.
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> basically takes two sets of command line
 arguments: client specifications (programs to run, etc), and server
 specifications (X server options), separated by <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">--</span>&#8221;</span>. If no
 client program is specified on the command line, <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>
 will look for a <code class="filename">.xinitrc</code> file in the user's home
 directory, to run as a shell script. If found, this then would in turn run
 whatever user specified commands to set up the environment, or launch
 programs that the file contained. If this file does not exist,
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> will use the following initial command:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
 xterm -geometry +1+1 -n login -display :0
 
 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 If no <code class="filename">.xserverrc</code> is found in the user's home directory, 
 <span class="application">X</span> itself will be started with the following command:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 X :0

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 As you see, this is not overly helpful as it just launches one
 <span class="application">xterm</span>. The <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>
 shell wrapper provides additional functionality and flexibility to 
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> will invoke 
 <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> for us, and provide some simple configuration
 options as well. You can also issue commands such as the following, for
 instance:
 
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
 startx -- -dpi 100 -depth 16   #force X to 100 dots per inch
                                #and colordepth of 16 (X v4 syntax)
 
 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Anything after the double dashes are passed as arguments directly to the X
 server via <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>. In this example, you can force
 <span class="application">X</span> to the resolution of your preference, and still
 have it use the configuration files we will cover later in this document. See
 the Xserver man page for more command line options.

</p><p>
 Instead of issuing the same command line every time, it is easier to use the
 configuration files to store this type of information for us.

</p><p>
 If you take a look at the <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> script
 (<code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/bin/startx</code> on my system), you see it uses
 two default configuration files to help set up the
 <span class="application">X</span> environment: <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> and
 <code class="filename">xserverrc</code>. It looks first in
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xinit/</code>, for the system wide files. It then
 checks the user's home directory for similar files, which will take
 precedence if found. Note that the latter are Unix style <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">dot</span>&#8221;</span> files
 (e.g. <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>), and are executable shell scripts.

</p><p>
 You normally would not want to edit the system wide files, but you can freely
 copy these to your home directory as a starting point, or just start from
 scratch. As you can tell by the names, one helps set up the X server, and one
 sets up <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span> by executing commands, preparing the
 environment and possibly starting client programs like
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> or a Window Manager (yes, it's a client too).

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm399"></a>3.1.1. xserverrc</h4></div></div></div><p>
 As with all XFree86 configuration files, this is a plain text file, and is
 usually a simple, one line statement to start the X server. It can include
 any valid command line options supported by your <span class="application">X</span>
 installation. If you always start <span class="application">X</span> with your own
 options, this should be easier than typing the options each time. One
 possible <code class="filename">~/.xserverrc</code>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 exec X :0 -dpi 100 -nolisten tcp

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This will start <span class="application">X</span> on display :0, the first
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>, at a dots-per-inch resolution of 100, and disables
 TCP connections. See the Xserver man page for other valid options. This is
 just an example.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm410"></a>3.1.2. xinitrc</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> is used to set up a suitable
 <span class="application">X</span> environment, and to launch other programs, a.k.a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">clients</span>&#8221;</span> that we may want available as soon as
 <span class="application">X</span> is started. You likely have a system wide
 <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> to start a predefined set off programs. To
 customize this, create your own in your home directory. Name it
 <code class="filename">.xinitrc</code>, make sure it is an executable script, and
 <span class="command"><strong>chmod +x</strong></span>. An example (slightly modified from the original
 on my system):

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

</p><p>
 Briefly, what this script does, is set up our working environment, with
 <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> (keyboard) and <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span>
 (application resource settings). More on these below.  Then the shell variable
 <code class="literal">$BROWSER</code> is set for a GUI environment (Netscape in this
 example) so that any applications that might expect this, have a reasonable
 choice available. Then the presence of the file <code class="filename">Xclients</code>
 is checked, both as a system wide file and in the user's home directory. In
 this particular example, this is where any client applications are to be
 started, including a Window Manager (see below). These could just have as
 easily been started here if we had wanted to. If an
 <code class="filename">Xclients</code> file can't be found, then a Window Manager is
 started for us. Either <span class="command"><strong>fvwm</strong></span>, if available, or XFree86's
 minimalist <span class="command"><strong>twm</strong></span> if not. If for some reason, neither of
 these can be started, the script would exit, and <span class="application">X</span>
 would fail to start.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm431"></a>3.1.3. Xclients</h4></div></div></div><p>
 Everything up to this point has followed pretty much a standard and
 predictable sequence of events. To summarize, we have invoked
 <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>, which in turn invoked <span class="command"><strong>xinit</strong></span>, 
 which has parsed <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> for initial settings. Most
 Linuxes should follow this same sequence, though the various values and
 settings may differ.

</p><p>
 We now are at the last link in the chain where the user normally would 
 specify his or her preferences, including the Window Manager and/or 
 desktop environment to be used. The system will provide sane, though possibly
 uninteresting, defaults if the user has not done so. Presumably, this is why
 you are here ;-)

</p><p>
 The Window Manager, or desktop environment, is typically the last application
 started. If you want other programs (like <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>) started,
 they should be started before the Window Manager and
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>&#8221;</span> with an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">&amp;</span>&#8221;</span>. This can all be
 done in the user's <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>. Or as in the above
 example, the actual applications are started from yet another script. Let's
 look at one short, hypothetical such script, <code class="filename">.Xclients</code>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.Xclients, start my programs.

xset s off s noblank
xset m 30/10 4
xset r rate 200 40

xscreensaver &amp; 
rxvt -geometry 80x50-50+150 &amp;

echo Starting Window Manager...

if [ -x /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker ]; then
  echo `date`: Trying /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
  exec /usr/X11R6/bin/wmaker &gt;&gt; ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
fi 

echo `date`: Failed, trying fvwm... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# let's try regular fvwm (AnotherLevel doesn't work with fvwm1).
if [ -n "$(type -path fvwm)" ]; then
  # if this works, we stop here
  exec fvwm &gt;&gt; ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1
fi

echo `date`: Failed, trying twm... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# wow, fvwm isn't here either ... 
# use twm as a last resort.
exec twm &gt;&gt; ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# Dead in the water here, X will exit as well, sigh...
echo `date`: Unable to start a Window Manager ... |tee -a ~/.wm-errors 2&gt;&amp;1

# eof

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This really isn't so different than what <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> was
 doing at all. We added a few wrinkles, including starting a screen saver, a
 different terminal emulator that this user prefers (<span class="command"><strong>rxvt</strong></span>),
 with even more setting up of the environment (monitor, mouse and keyboard) using
 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> this time, and a different Window Manager than was
 available with the system defaults. This is in the user's home directory, so
 it will not be overwritten during upgrades too.

</p><p>
 Actually, <span class="application">X</span> has already started at this point, and
 we are just putting the finishing touches on the configuration. Notice the
 Window Managers are not <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>&#8221;</span> with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">&amp;</span>&#8221;</span>
 here. This is important! Something has to run in the foreground, or
 <span class="application">X</span> will exit. We didn't start a desktop environment
 in this example, like <span class="application">KDE</span> or
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>, but if we did, this final application
 would have to be <span class="command"><strong>gnome-session</strong></span> or
 <span class="command"><strong>startkde</strong></span> instead. Since we are rolling our own here, if we
 wanted to change Window Managers, all we have to do is edit this file, and
 restart <span class="application">X</span>. Vendor supplied configurations may be
 more complex than this, but the same principles apply.

</p><p>
 As an afterword, do not think that any initial client applications
 <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be started as we've done here. This is how it has
 been traditionally done, and some may prefer this approach. Most window
 managers have their own built-in ways to start initial programs, as do 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> and <span class="application">GNOME</span>. See 
 the respective documentation.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm464"></a>3.2. Display Managers</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The other, more common, approach is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">GUI log-in</span>&#8221;</span>, where
 <span class="application">X</span> is running before log-in. This is done with the
 help of a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display manager</span>&#8221;</span>, of which there are various
 implementations. XFree86 includes <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span> (X Display Manager)
 for this purpose, though your distribution may use one of the others such as
 <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> (<span class="application">GNOME</span>) or <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span>
 (<span class="application">KDE</span>).

</p><p>
 Display managers really do much more than enable GUI style log-ins. They 
 are also used to manage local as well as remote <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> on a
 network. We shall not get into details on this here, but it is nicely covered in
 the <em class="citetitle">Remote X Apps Mini HOWTO</em> and the <em class="citetitle">XDMCP
 HOWTO</em> (see the <a class="link" href="#links" title="10.2. Links and other References">links section</a>). For
 our purposes here, they provide similar services to <span class="command"><strong>getty</strong></span>
 and <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span>, which allow users to log into a system and
 start their default shell, but in a GUI environment. 

</p><p>
 Here is an example of a more advanced usage of what else a display manager
 might be used for, from Diego Zamboni:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
 I have two X sessions running with different resolutions. I switch between
 them depending on whether my laptop is connected to an external monitor or
 using its own LCD display.

</p><p>
 Here's my <code class="filename">/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> file that initiates 
 both displays:
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 -layout 1600x1200

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Then I have <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">1024x768</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">1600x1200</span>&#8221;</span> defined as
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">server layouts</span>&#8221;</span> in my
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</code>, as follows:

 Note the use of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Identifiers</span>&#8221;</span> here. Diego is starting two
 separate <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> here. Then he can choose which one he 
 wants when he logs in.

</p><p>
 Most display managers are derived from XFree86's venerable
 <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>, and add their own enhancements. Let's look at the
 most popular ones briefly. 

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm501"></a>3.2.1. xdm</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span> can be configured with configuration files located in
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/</code>,
 <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm</code>, or similar locations depending
 on your system. These are system wide files. The file
 <code class="filename">xdm-config</code> is the main configuration file, and mostly
 describes where to find secondary configuration files:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 ! $XConsortium: xdm-conf.cpp /main/3 1996/01/15 15:17:26 gildea $
 DisplayManager.errorLogFile:	/var/log/xdm-errors
 DisplayManager.servers:		/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers
 DisplayManager.accessFile:	/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess
 ! All displays should use authorization, but we cannot be sure
 ! X terminals will be configured that way, so by default
 ! use authorization only for local displays :0, :1, etc.

 DisplayManager._1.authorize:	true
 ! The following three resources set up display :0 as the console.
 DisplayManager._0.setup:	/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0

 !
 ! SECURITY: do not listen for XDMCP or Chooser requests

 DisplayManager.requestPort:	0

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">!</span>&#8221;</span> denotes comments. The command that starts the X server
 is in <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> in this particular example
 as defined by <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">DisplayManager.servers</span>&#8221;</span>, and is the equivalent to
 <code class="filename">xserverrc</code> that was used for <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> X
 server start up commands, but the syntax is slightly different here. The
 contents of <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code> on my system are simply:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X 

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This starts <span class="application">X</span> on the first local display
 (designated by 0). Any special command line arguments that you want to add go
 here at the end.

</p><p>
 Below is a sample <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</code> which is
 used to configure the log-in screen only. Notice that we're using a shell
 script here, and it's calling <span class="command"><strong>xv</strong></span> (a graphics display
 program) to set the background to a nice image (instead of the boring black
 and white background pattern), and if that fails,
 <span class="command"><strong>xsetroot</strong></span> is then invoked to at least try to set the
 background to a nicer blue color. This does not configure the login widget
 itself -- just other things that might be wanted on the screen during login.
 
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
 #!/bin/sh
 xconsole -geometry 480x100-0-0 -daemon -notify -verbose -fn \
   '-schumacher-clean-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*' -exitOnFail  &amp;

   || xsetroot -solid darkblue
 
 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xresources</code> controls the X
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resources</span>&#8221;</span> used during log in. In this context, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resources</span>&#8221;</span> 
 are user preferences for such items as fonts and colors (described in more
 detail below). Below is a snippet that sets up fonts for the log-in widget:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 #if WIDTH &gt; 800
 xlogin*greetFont: -adobe-helvetica-bold-o-normal--24-240-75-75-p-138-iso8859-1

 xlogin*failFont: -adobe-helvetica-bold-o-normal--14-140-75-75-p-82-iso8859-1
 #endif

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 As you can see this is using helvetica as the preferred font, with different
 point sizes and dots per inch depending on the screen size. This is
 customizable to suit individual needs. (See below for more on understanding X
 font naming conventions.) Various other aspects can similarly be configured.

</p><p>
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</code> is the rough equivalent to
 <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> for <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>. It will similarly
 set up a default environment for keyboard, etc. And can also start either 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> or <span class="application">GNOME</span>, and other
 <span class="application">X</span> client programs. This is the system wide
 configuration file. It should also check the user's home directory for
 <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code>, and possibly
 <code class="filename">~/.Xclients</code>, which would contain the user's preferred
 environment and start up programs, just as <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>
 did with <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span>. Again, the files in a user's home
 directory may be created or modified by the user any time and must be
 executable shell scripts.

</p><p>
 We shall not include an <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code> example here, since it
 would be very similar to the <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code> and 
 <code class="filename">~/.Xclients</code> examples above.

</p><p>
 We've looked only briefly at the main <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span> configuration files.
 Be sure to read the man page, and look at what is installed locally, for more 
 information. Let's look now at <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span>. 
 We'll just highlight significant differences, since they essentially provide
 the same functionality.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm553"></a>3.2.2. gdm</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> is the default display manager for
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>. <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> was written 
 from scratch, but functions similarly to <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>. The main
 configuration file is <code class="filename">gdm.conf</code>, typically located as
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</code>. This is quite different looking
 than <code class="filename">xdm-config</code>. Comments are denoted with a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">#</span>&#8221;</span>, and the file has sections, with section headers enclosed
 in square brackets. The command to start <span class="application">X</span> is in
 the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[servers]</span>&#8221;</span> section:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 [servers]
 0=/usr/bin/X11/X
 #1=/usr/bin/X11/X

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Notice this has potentially two displays set up, but the second one is
 commented out. Add any additional <span class="application">X</span> startup
 options here, e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">-dpi 100</span>&#8221;</span>. The log-in screen and log-in
 widget are configured in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[greeter]</span>&#8221;</span> section. 

</p><p>
 Start up clients and programs are determined by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">SessionDir</span>&#8221;</span>
 statement in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[daemon]</span>&#8221;</span> section. On my installation, this
 points to <code class="filename">/etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/</code>, which contains several
 short scripts. If I look at my <code class="filename">Default</code> script, it
 actually executes <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</code>, which in turn
 would execute <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code>, if present. So at this final 
 stage, <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> acts very much like <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">GNOME</span> includes the <span class="command"><strong>gdmconfig</strong></span>
 utility to control many aspects of <span class="command"><strong>gdm</strong></span> behavior. 

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm585"></a>3.2.3. kdm</h4></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> is the display manager from <span class="application">KDE</span>. 
 The main configuration file for <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> is
 <code class="filename">kdmrc</code> and is typically installed
 as <code class="filename">/etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc</code>. As is the case with
 <code class="filename">gdm.conf</code>, <code class="filename">kdmrc</code> uses
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">#</span>&#8221;</span> for comments, and has sections with section headers in
 similar square brackets. <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> configuration can also be
 edited with the <span class="command"><strong>kcontrol</strong></span> utility.

</p><p>
 The visible desktop is configured in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[Desktop*]</span>&#8221;</span>
 section(s), and by the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Setup</span>&#8221;</span> directive which should point to a
 file like <code class="filename">/usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup</code> or 
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</code>. This will accomplish the same
 thing as <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>'s <code class="filename">Xsetup_0</code> does: namely
 running any programs the user might want such as <span class="command"><strong>xconsole</strong></span>.

</p><p>
 The command to launch the X server is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Xservers</span>&#8221;</span> directive
 in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[General]</span>&#8221;</span>. Again, this should point to a file such as 
 <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code>, and uses the same syntax as
 <span class="command"><strong>xdm</strong></span>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X 

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Any command line options for the X server, go here.

</p><p>
 The login widget itself is configured in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">[X-*-Greeter]</span>&#8221;</span>
 section(s). Compiled in defaults are used if the user does not specify any.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">KDE</span> includes the <span class="command"><strong>kdmdesktop</strong></span>
 utility to control some aspects of <span class="command"><strong>kdm</strong></span> behavior, mostly 
 just the login background.

</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="moreconfig"></a>4. More X Configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>
 Before taking a look at various configuration mechanisms for X servers and
 clients, it should be noted that the advent of Desktop Environments like 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> have become popular in part because they can
 control much of the user interaction configuration themselves with nice, 
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">user friendly</span>&#8221;</span> GUI controls. And in fact,
 the compliant applications that are part of the respective Desktops will be
 best configured through the Desktop's configuration tools, or the
 application's own GUI configuration methods. So, for instance,
 <span class="command"><strong>gtop</strong></span>, a <span class="application">GNOME</span> client
 application, is best configured via <span class="application">GNOME</span> or 
 <span class="command"><strong>gtop's</strong></span> own menus. But this is not true of all 
 <span class="application">X</span> applications. 

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="xresources"></a>4.1. X Resources</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The X server can store various configuration values for client programs
 so they are readily available when needed. If the application supports this,
 it will use these as defaults whenever that program is invoked. These are
 known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Resources</span>&#8221;</span>, and are often used to define user preferences
 on a per application basis for fonts, colors, screen placement (geometry) and
 various other attributes. This makes it easy to customize applications.

</p><p>
 Resources are specified as text strings (e.g. Netscape*blinkingEnabled:
 False) that can be read from disk in various places when
 <span class="application">X</span> is starting, or even interactively defined on the
 command line. Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion, with
 each object in the hierarchy identified by a class as well as an instance
 name. At the top level of the hierarchy is the class and instance name of the
 application itself. Typically, the class name of the application is the
 same as the program name, but with the first letter capitalized (e.g.  Vim or
 Emacs) although some programs that begin with the letter <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X</span>&#8221;</span>
 also capitalize the second letter for historical reasons (e.g. XTerm). 
 Each definition  will specify a class (or instance), with corresponding
 resource and value. Below this in the hierarchy are the various attributes
 that make up the definable aspects of the application. 

</p><p>
 Traditionally, most <span class="application">X</span> programs were  configured
 this way. This is not as true today with the advent of Desktop Environments
 which often have their own configuration mechanisms.

</p><p>
 As an example, say we prefer to run <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> with a blue
 background. So if we run it from the command line, we would run it as:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xterm -bg blue &amp;

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 If this is our preference, it would be easier to put this preference in a
 file somewhere, and have the system use our preference. That way whenever we
 started <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>, it would use our preferred value, and we 
 wouldn't need the command line options (unless as an override).

</p><p>
 The basic <span class="application">X</span> resource syntax is expressed like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 &lt;program&gt;&lt;binding&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;binding&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;...&gt;&lt;resource&gt;:&lt;value&gt;

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Which, in real life, typically looks something like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xterm*fontMenu*background: darkblue

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 It should be obvious what this does. The use of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221;</span> in the
 definition, is called a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">loose binding</span>&#8221;</span> and acts as a 
 wild-card. Meaning there may be gaps in the widget hierarchy. For instance:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xterm*background: darkblue

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This would also give a dark blue background for the <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>
 fontMenu, but also any other <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> properties that also have a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">background</span>&#8221;</span> attribute (e.g. window background, etc), no matter 
 where they may be in the widget hierarchy. Similarly:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 *background: darkblue

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This would define the background for any and all programs that support it -- not just
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>. Using a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.</span>&#8221;</span> in place of a
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221;</span> would be more precise, and will not allow for wild-card gaps
 in the hierarchy. Also, the application must support the particular widget 
 attribute. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Background</span>&#8221;</span> is a fairly safe bet, but many
 applications will have more specialized resources that are not so obvious. It
 is best to check local documentation (man pages, etc), or see if an
 application has an included examples. For instance, <span class="command"><strong>Netscape</strong></span> 
 generally comes with an <code class="filename">Netscape.ad</code> file that has an extensive 
 set of resource definitions that can be customized.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">X</span> resources are typically stored in more than one
 place (see below) and are processed by the <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span> command (see man page).

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm673"></a>4.1.1. App Defaults</h4></div></div></div><p>
 One way of storing preferred application resources is via files named for the
 application in an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">app-defaults</span>&#8221;</span> directory. For instance, on my
 system, these are in <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/</code>,
 though this may vary according to options your vendor has chosen. This
 directory contains a number of files for such well known
 <span class="application">X</span> applications as <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>,
 <span class="command"><strong>xclock</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>xcalc</strong></span>,
 <span class="command"><strong>xload</strong></span>, and so on. All in all, it is a relatively small 
 number of applications in the overall scheme of things. So not all
 applications use this scheme. In fact, most do not.

</p><p>
 Each file will contain resource definitions for that application. The X
 server loads these by itself during start up. A brief example from 
 <code class="filename">XTerm-color</code>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 ! $XFree86$

 #include "XTerm"

 *VT100*colorMode: on
 *VT100*dynamicColors: on

 ! Uncomment this use color for underline attribute
 !*VT100*colorULMode: on

 *VT100*color13: magenta
 *VT100*color14: cyan
 *VT100*color15: white
 *VT100*colorUL: yellow
 *VT100*colorBD: white

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This is mostly various color definitions. The application classname is not
 explicitly stated, and is assumed from the filename. So think of each line as
 starting: <code class="literal">XTerm-color*</code>. Also, notice at the top, the
 <code class="literal">#include "XTerm"</code> line, which <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">includes</span>&#8221;</span> the
 resource definitions for <span class="command"><strong>XTerm</strong></span>, a much longer file with a
 more diverse set of definitions. (Not included due to length, but worth
 looking at.) These files provide system wide defaults, and generally
 speaking, would not normally be edited by the user.
 
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm692"></a>4.1.2. Xdefaults</h4></div></div></div><p>
 Another common method of reading in resource preferences, is with an
 <code class="filename">Xdefaults</code> file. Or, sometimes the naming 
 scheme may be <code class="filename">Xresources</code> instead. This may exist as a
 system wide file, such as <code class="filename">/etc/X11/Xresources</code>. 
 Of course, the user is free to create a personal version in his home
 directory, e.g. <code class="filename">~/.Xdefaults</code>. The user's version will 
 over-ride any system wide settings, and will remain after system upgrades. 
 Obviously, this is the place to put your own preferences.

</p><p>
 <code class="filename">Xresources</code> files are read into the resource database
 with the <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span> command. Example:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This can be done interactively at the command line, or placed in a script and
 run automatically as the <span class="application">X</span> session is started. In
 the case of system wide files, this should be taken care of by the vendor
 supplied start up scripts. Generally, such scripts will also check the user's
 home directory as well (see the <code class="filename">xinitrc</code> example above).
 So probably all that need be done, is to create the file with a text editor.

</p><p>
 Here's an example to illustrate a very few of the many things that might
 be done with an <code class="filename">.Xdefaults</code> file:

 <span class="application">X</span> does not need to be restarted if
 <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span> is used interactively from the command line after
 making changes. The effects are immediate.

</p><p>

 Command line options will over-ride any existing resource definitions.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm715"></a>4.2. xmodmap, the Keyboard and Mice</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The keyboard and mouse, as well as other possible input devices, are defined
 in <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> (or <code class="filename">XF86Config-4</code>).
 There is a keyboard layout that is defined based on the preferred language:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "Keyboard0"
	Driver      "keyboard"
	Option      "XkbLayout"	"us"
 EndSection

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 This gives us our default keyboard layout. Valid layout labels are listed in
 <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols</code>. Also, the
 <span class="command"><strong>setxkbmap</strong></span> utility can be used to change this
 interactively.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">X</span> is highly customizable, and we can modify the
 keyboard and mouse pointer mappings to suit our own preferences. The utility
 to do this is <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> (see man page). You don't like where
 the capslock key is? So move it ;-)

</p><p>
 Like <span class="command"><strong>xrdb</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> can be run from the
 command line. Or, preferred settings can be stored in a file. Typically this
 is <code class="filename">~/.Xmodmap</code>, or similar. If your
 <span class="application">X</span> start up files don't parse this, then edit as
 appropriate so that they do (probably from <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code> or
 <code class="filename">~/.xsession</code>).

</p><p>
 You can view your current key and mouse mappings with: <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap -pk
 -pp |less</strong></span>. This will print out all active <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">keycode</span>&#8221;</span>
 values, with corresponding <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">keysym</span>&#8221;</span> values, and any keysym names
 that <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> knows about (e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">BackSpace</span>&#8221;</span>).
 And should also give you an idea of how <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span>
 understands key and mouse events. There are two keysyms per keycode. The
 second is the shifted value. XFree86's <span class="command"><strong>xev</strong></span> utility can be
 used to dump a lot of information on key-presses and mouse events
 interactively. Pay attention to the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">keycode</span>&#8221;</span> value. That is
 what you will need to know in order to re-map.

</p><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>xmodmap</strong></span> is often used to make minor keyboard adjustments,
 like proper Backspace/Delete mapping. Or can be used make major adjustments
 such as for international mappings. You can only re-map keys and mouse events
 -- you cannot assign macros to key events (your Window Manager or Desktop
 might have some of this functionality).

</p><p>
 A nice discussion of 
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Intkeyb/index.html" target="_top">setting up international keyboards
</a>.
 
Also, 
<a class="ulink" href="http://google.com/linux" target="_top">Google search</a> 
 will turn up many creative examples.

</p><p>
 The man page has many brief examples of various usages. Here is what an 
 one hypothetical <code class="filename">~/.Xmodmap</code> might look like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 ! /home/hal/.Xmodmap, last change 10/03/01
 !
 ! Force backspace to 22 and Delete to 111
 keycode 22 = BackSpace
 keycode 111 = Delete
 !
 ! My keyboard handles right and left Alt differently. Make the 
 ! Right act like the Left to avoid digital gymnastics.
 keycode 63 = Alt_L
 keycode 113 = Meta_L
 !
 ! Hard-code the keypad to numeric values as if numlock is always on 
 ! since I never use it for anything else.
 keycode 79=7
 keycode 80=8
 keycode 81=9
 keycode 83=4
 keycode 84=5
 keycode 85=6
 keycode 87=1
 keycode 88=2
 keycode 89=3
 keycode 90=0
 keycode 91=period
 keycode 86 = plus
 ! deactivate Num_Lock key since we don't need it now.
 keycode 77 =

 ! My capslock is next to tab. I hit it by mistake sometimes, 
 ! and don't use it anyway. So make capslock act like Tab.
 keycode 66 = Tab
 clear lock
 !
 ! Reverse mouse buttons for left-handed people
 pointer = 3 2 1

</p><p>
 As with many XFree86 files, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">!</span>&#8221;</span> represents a comment. 
 Another possible use, is to redefine those annoying <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Windows</span>&#8221;</span>
 keys to something useful. Hopefully this gives an idea of some things one
 might want to do to make the keyboard more agreeable to us.

</p><p>
 Speaking of the <code class="literal">Numlock</code> key, <span class="application">X</span>
 will typically disable this when it starts up. No matter how you have the
 BIOS set up, or Linux set up before <span class="application">X</span> starts. So the
 trick above is one way. There is also a utility available as either
 <span class="application">numlockx</span>, or
 <span class="application">setnumlock</span>, that can be found on the &#8217;Net, if
 your distribution does not include one or the other. This can be put in a
 start up file to turn <code class="literal">Numlock</code> on automatically if you would
 prefer.

</p><p>
 Window Managers and Desktop Environments will also allow customization of the
 keyboard and mouse (as long as it is recognized correctly by
 <span class="application">X</span>). This may be an easier way to configure certain 
 customizations.

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm765"></a>4.2.1. Special Key Mappings</h4></div></div></div><p>
 There are several special key mappings traditionally used in
 XFree86.

</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>BackSpace</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
     Will kill the <span class="application">X</span> server process in an orderly
     fashion. This is a quick, easy, legitimate way to restart
     <span class="application">X</span>. Note it does not restart the display
     manager (if used) &#8212; just <span class="application">X</span> itself.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    
where <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> 
corresponds to a valid <acronym class="acronym">TTY</acronym> number
    (typically 1&#8211;6). 
This is typically used to jump to a text console login,
    while <span class="application">X</span> remains running. To get back to
    <span class="application">X</span>, 
press 
<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></strong></span>. In this
    case, <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> 
represents one plus the last <acronym class="acronym">TTY</acronym> 
(e.g. <span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F7</strong></span> if
    there are six available <acronym class="acronym">TTY</acronym>&#8217;s). 
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>+</strong></span> 
and <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>-</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    That is the plus and minus keys on
    the keypad. This will cycle through any existing valid screen resolution 
    modes, e.g. 1024×768 &#8594; 600×800. Note the actual screen
    size is the same &#8212; just the view and resolution changes. 
Not all that
    useful for most purposes. You cannot permanently change the screen 
    resolution without restarting <span class="application">X</span>.
    
   </p></dd></dl></div><p>
 It's possible your Window Manager, Desktop Environment or other system
 component may trap these, and alter the standard behavior. In addition, the
 <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Delete</strong></span> may be trapped as well. This should shut
 <span class="application">X</span> (and the system) down orderly, if it is
 available.

  As mentioned, Linux and Unix make heavy use of three mouse buttons. If a
  mouse only has two buttons, then the third (i.e. the middle) button can
  be simulated by pressing both buttons simultaneously. This is a
  configuration option set in <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> as the 
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Emulate3Buttons</span>&#8221;</span> directive:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "Mouse0"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
	Option      "Protocol" "PS/2"
	Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "on"
 EndSection

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 When all is said and done, a third button is quite handy and I would personally recommend
 having one. On wheeled mice, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">wheel</span>&#8221;</span> acts as the third
 button, if pressed. Many standard wheel mice seem to work with the
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">IMPS/2</span>&#8221;</span> protocol option.

</p><p>
 Specifically, the third button (middle) is the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">paste</span>&#8221;</span> button in
 virtually all Linux applications. Copy and paste works a little different in
 Linux. The left button is the copy button. Just hold it down, and drag over
 text. It is automatically copied to the <span class="application">X</span>
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">clipboard</span>&#8221;</span>. Then, the middle button will paste from there. A
 very simple process. A double-click should copy individual words, and a
 triple-click individual lines of text. If for some reason, this does not
 work, it is either a poorly implemented application, or a bug of some kind.
 Some older versions of <span class="application">Netscape</span> were not
 consistent about this, for instance. To paste from the keyboard, this should 
 be shift+insert.

</p><p>
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Drag and Drop</span>&#8221;</span> is not natively supported by
 <span class="application">X</span> itself. But, is implemented by some toolkits and
 Desktop Environments. One should not expect this to work with non-compliant
 applications (i.e non-<span class="application">KDE</span> aware applications in 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> for example).

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm842"></a>4.3. xset</h3></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> is yet another XFree86 utility to set user
 preferences. <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> is a bit of a catch-all and is used 
 to change various, unrelated X server settings. Mostly this is a command 
 line way of configuring some of the same things that are defined in 
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> (but not everything!).

</p><p>
 Common usages of <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> are to set DPMS on or off and
 preferred intervals, to dynamically change the FontPath or re-read it, to
 control keyboard LEDs, to adjust mouse (or other pointer) movement speed,
 set keyboard <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">autorepeat</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">repeat</span>&#8221;</span> rates, and
 to control <span class="application">X's</span> built in screen blanking. See the
 man page, of course, for detailed explanations, and other
 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> usages.

</p><p>
 Again, <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> can be used interactively from the command
 line. But most often preferred settings are stored in one of the start up 
 configuration files, like <code class="filename">.xinitrc</code> or
 <code class="filename">.xsession</code>. A very brief example:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 # Turn off screen blanking
 xset s off
 
 # Enable DPMS energy saving
 xset +dpms
 
 # Tweak the rodent
 xset m 30/10 4
 
 # Speed up keyboard
 xset r rate 200 40

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Your desktop may have a GUI front-end for <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span>.

</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="fontscolors"></a>5. Fonts and Colors</h2></div></div></div><p>
 Understanding fonts and colors can be more complex in
 <span class="application">X</span> than on other platforms. 
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm866"></a>5.1. Fonts Demystified</h3></div></div></div><p>
 <span class="application">X</span> knows about various font types, including
 bitmaps, Type 1, and as of v4.x, TrueType. The X server can either handle
 fonts itself, or sometimes this duty is forked to a font server (of which
 there are several). <span class="command"><strong>xfs</strong></span> (X Font Server) is the most common
 font server in use on Linux.

</p><p>
 A font server is not required, as <span class="application">X</span> can handle
 most font rendering itself. Font servers are traditionally used for serving
 fonts to multiple hosts on a network, but sometimes are also used to provide 
 enhanced functionality. Additionally, a font server may provide a modest
 performance boost by off-loading font rendering to a separate process.

</p><p>
 <span class="application">X</span> knows about fonts according to fonts that are in
 the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">FontPath</span>&#8221;</span>. This is set initially in
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code>. If the X server is handling font duties
 itself (i.e. no font server), this will be a list of directories that contain
 font files, like:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled"
 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled"
 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled"
 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc"
 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
 FontPath        "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 If a font server is being used, the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">FontPath</span>&#8221;</span> will point to the
 socket where the font server is serving (this is just one possible example):

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 FontPath "unix/:7101"

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 In this latter case, the actual font directories that are available will be
 configured with the font server (see local documentation), which will use a
 similar directory type scheme as shown for <code class="filename">XF86Config</code>.

</p><p>
 Once suitable fonts have been installed, they must be
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">prepared</span>&#8221;</span>. For most fonts, this means running the 
 <span class="command"><strong>mkfontdir</strong></span> utility (see man page) in the directory where
 the fonts are (as root). Type 1 and TrueType require additional steps (see
 below). Your vendor has done this for any fonts that were included with your
 distribution. So, this will only need to be done for fonts that you add. For
 newly added fonts to become visible to <span class="application">X</span>, 
 you will need to run the appropriate
 <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> commands to either modify the existing FontPath, or
 re-read it (see man page). Or, re-initialize your font server.

</p><p>
 Example: Preparing fonts, and re-initializing font server after adding new
 fonts:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 su 
 &lt;password&gt;
 mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/my_new_fonts/
 /etc/init.d/xfs restart

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 The first command may not be necessary on newer distros (since it's done by
 the init script in some cases). And the font server configuration would need
 to be modified, if this is a new directory. Example: re-initializing with no
 font server:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 su 
 &lt;password&gt;
 mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/my_new_fonts/
 xset +fp /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/my_new_fonts/
 xset fp rehash

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="command"><strong>xset +fp</strong></span></span>&#8221;</span> would not be necessary if the
 directory is already part of the FontPath.

</p><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>xlsfonts | less</strong></span> can be used to list what fonts are known,
 and thus available, to <span class="application">X</span> and its clients. Run
 <span class="command"><strong>xlsfonts | less</strong></span>, and you also can get an idea of the font
 definition as understood by <span class="application">X</span>. Font resources are
 specified quite explicitly, and it may seem complex at first. The <span class="emphasis"><em>X
 Logical Font Description</em></span> (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">XLFD</span>&#8221;</span>) is the full
 description for any given font. The XLFD looks like:

 The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">*</span>&#8221;</span> acts as a wild-card character. In fact, if not every
 field is specified, the X server will take the first match it finds in 
 the FontPath. This is why it is best to order the FontPath with preferred
 fonts coming first since some programs will deliberately specify fonts 
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">loosely</span>&#8221;</span> so that your system has some discretion.

</p><p>
 The program <span class="command"><strong>xfontsel</strong></span> (<span class="application">X</span> 
 Font Selector) may be useful. Try launching it now. You will see 
 nothing helpful in the main window at first, but try holding the left button
 down on the <code class="literal">fndry</code> button. If all your fonts are
 in order, you will see a menu of selections such as <code class="literal">adobe</code> and <code class="literal">b&amp;h</code> and
 <code class="literal">bitstream</code> and so forth. Select one such as
 <code class="literal">b&amp;h</code> and you will notice that the font in
 the lower window changes to something intelligible. This is the way 
 fonts are selected with this program; starting from the left, which is the
 most general selection, and moving toward the right, to the more specific
 options. Selecting an option toward the rightmost end will not make much
 sense before the foundry, for instance, is selected, because the options are
 generally ordered by their dependence on each other. 
 
</p><p>
 When you select from the <code class="literal">fmly</code> selection,
 you will see most of the options grayed out, and only three remaining. That
 means that these three are the only families of font made by this foundry.
 Some families appear under more than one foundry, for instance, both
 <span class="emphasis"><em>Adobe</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Bitstream</em></span> make a
 variation of the Courier font. Now you can select the <code class="literal">wght</code>, and so forth. After you get far enough you will
 have narrowed it down to the font that you want. You don't necessarily have
 to fill in all the options to choose a single font, there's not
 <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> many fonts on your system! The options that you do
 not select will be represented by a <code class="literal">*</code>
 indicating that any option will do in that spot, and gives X some leeway.
</p><p>
 When you are satisfied with your font selection, hit the select button,
 and your selection will be placed in the <span class="application">X</span>
 clipboard, ready to be pasted into your document or whatever you are working
 on. For example, open an <span class="emphasis"><em>xterm</em></span> window and
 type in something like <code class="literal">xterm -font </code> followed by
 an opening quotation mark. Then point to that spot on your screen, and click
 your middle mouse button (or click both the left and right, if you are
 middle-button impaired). This will paste the selection from the clipboard,
 which should be the font you just selected. Then enter the closing quote, and
 hit <code class="literal">Enter</code>. For instance, a nice big <span class="emphasis"><em>xterm</em></span> with a Courier font specified would look like
 this: <code class="literal">xterm -font
 "-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"</code>. 
</p><p>
 If you've found a font you prefer, this can permanently be used by placing the 
 font definition in the appropriate configuration file (see above).

</p><p>
  Note that you can also limit the number of fonts that you want 
  <span class="command"><strong>xfontsel</strong></span> to display with the command line option
 <span class="emphasis"><em>-pattern</em></span>, followed by a quoted font specification, as
 discussed above.

</p><p>
 The <span class="command"><strong>xfd</strong></span> utility is also helpful for examining
 individual fonts. If launched with a command line such as <span class="command"><strong>xfd
 -fn fixed</strong></span>, it will show you the complete character set for that font.
</p><p>
 <span class="application">KDE</span> and <span class="application">GNOME</span> have
 their own utilities that are not quite as obtuse ;-)

</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm986"></a>5.1.1. Type 1 and TrueType Fonts</h4></div></div></div><p>
 The fonts provided with XFree86 are of limited use for many of us,
 considering that about the only place you'll find fonts of that kind, are
 used in the X Window System itself for the most part. Unfortunately many
 media junkies, web designers and fontaholics work in operating systems that
 rely on other formats. And then, there often does not seem to be much
 emphasis by some distributions on making the best of the default fonts
 either. 
</p><p>
 Type 1 fonts, most commonly used in conjunction with PostScript document
 formats, are the traditional standard in Unix and Linux environments. You
 should have a reasonably good starter selection installed already. Or, more
 can be found for free on the Internet with considerable ease, and Try <a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/" target="_top">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/</a>
 for starters. Type 1 are scalable fonts, and have many of the same benefits
 of the better known TrueType fonts. If you don't have a good selection of
 TrueType fonts installed, then Type 1 is what you want for most GUI
 applications. But again, this is not standard on  other platforms, and can 
 present problems when viewing documents (e.g. web pages) that are designed 
 with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">other platforms</span>&#8221;</span> in mind.

</p><p>
 TrueType fonts started with Apple, and later were licensed by Microsoft. So
 people migrating from non-Unix platforms are already familiar with these high
 quality fonts. Unfortunately, there are not many quality TrueType fonts under
 a suitable license, and thus there are not many included with Linux
 distributions. And the ones that are, often are not as high quality. Also
 unfortunately, TrueType has become somewhat of a standard on the Web and in
 other venues, and not having good TrueType fonts can be a detriment. 
 XFree86 also seems to render TrueType a little better than Type1.

</p><p>
 That is the bad news. The good news is that any TrueType font included with
 any version of Windows, or any Windows applications, should work on Linux.
 Though you will have to take some additional steps to integrate them. This 
 particularly helps web browsing where <span class="application">X's</span>
 bitmapped fonts just don't scale well.

</p><p>
 
We shall not go into detail on installing and configuring these fonts here, 
as it is addressed in depth in other documents. See 
<a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Font-HOWTO.html" target="_top">The Font HOWTO</a>
 for general font information, and Type 1 tips.

 Let's go back to our terminal window and try something. Open an
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> with a command line like the following:
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
 
 xterm -fg DarkSteelBlue1 -bg red3 &amp;
 
 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Ouch! While that may not be pretty, and you may not do much of your best work
 in it, it demonstrates one interesting aspect of <span class="application">X</span>
 configuration -- color names. While not particularly precise, this is a nice
 way to remember a variety of colors. Note that color names are never
 case-sensitive.

</p><p>
 The X server will actually deal with color values as a hexadecimal
 Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color notation. This would look something like
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">#0aff0a</span>&#8221;</span> in hex. Not so easy to remember. But
 <span class="application">X</span> gives a more mnemonic way of remembering valid
 color definitions. These are stored in a text table, typically as
 <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt</code>, and is defined in 
 <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Files</span>&#8221;</span> section.

</p><p>
 If you are interested, have a look with a text editor. There are many, many
 shades defined. I count eighty-three shades of blue in mine, for instance. Brief
 snip:

 This file can be customized should you desire, but this is rarely needed for
 most of us. It is important to have though, since some applications depend on
 it.

 Managers as well. Your distribution probably has included at least several.
 Try them all if you don't already have a favorite. Your distribution probably
 also has a method of switching dynamically between Window Managers (and Desktop
 Environments too).

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1065"></a>6.2. Desktop Environments</h3></div></div></div><p>
 Desktop Environments are not really new, but their popularity has increased
 with advent of the two big names: <span class="application">KDE</span> and
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>. To a certain extent, the Desktop
 Environment functionality overlaps the Window Manager's. They both can be
 responsible for the root window background, root window menu, icons,
 taskbars, etc. Generally speaking, if a Desktop Environment is running, it is
 controlling these aspects. That is the main idea behind them -- to integrate
 the various components into a cohesive, consistent whole. Desktop
 Environments also add some interoperability and ease-of-use features that a
 simple Window Manager cannot. 
</p><p>
 Oh, another point: Desktop Environments also try to do as much
 <span class="application">X</span> session configuration as possible. Any of their
 compliant clients will more than likely be configured by the Desktop, or have
 it's own configuration that conforms to the Desktop's style. This is at
 least partly to avoid much of the seemingly helter-skelter text file
 configuration we looked at in the above sections, and make life a little
 easier for the user.

</p><p>
 There is a trade-off in this additional functionality, and that is that it
 takes memory and system resources to oversee all this. If you have plenty of
 memory and a fast computer, this is no problem. But in low memory situations,
 this can cause a slowdown (see the <a class="link" href="#performance" title="9. Performance Considerations">performance
 section</a> below). 64M of RAM is probably borderline with either 
 <span class="application">KDE</span> or <span class="application">GNOME</span>.

</p><p>
 So do you need a Desktop Environment? That is up to the user. They are
 certainly not required to run <span class="application">X</span>, but do add
 features that many users want or expect in a GUI. Which one is better? Ah,
 but that is up to you to decide!

</p><p>
 <span class="application">KDE</span> has been around longer than
 <span class="application">GNOME</span>, and some would say maybe a little more
 mature. <span class="application">KDE</span> is based on the QT widget toolkit. A
 quote from the <a class="ulink" href="http://kde.org" target="_top">KDE home page</a>:

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p> 
  KDE is a powerful Open Source graphical desktop environment for Unix
  workstations.  It combines ease of use, contemporary functionality, and
  outstanding graphical design with the technological superiority of the Unix
  operating system.
</p><p>
 KDE is a mature desktop suite providing a solid basis to an ever growing
 number of applications for Unix workstations.  KDE has developed a high
 quality development framework for Unix, which allows for the rapid and
 efficient creation of applications.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
 <span class="application">GNOME</span> is based on the GTK+ toolkit.
 And a quote from the <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org" target="_top">GNOME home page</a>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
 GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment. The GNOME project
 intends to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based entirely on free
 software. GNOME is part of the GNU project, and GNOME is part of the Open
 Source(tm) movement. The desktop will consist of small utilities and larger
 applications which share a consistent look and feel. GNOME uses GTK+ as the
 GUI toolkit for all GNOME-compliant applications.
 </p></blockquote></div><p>
 <span class="application">XFce</span> is a lighter weight, less featureful Desktop
 Environment that does not get as much attention as the others.
 <span class="application">XFce</span> is also based on the GTK+ toolkit. And a
 quote from the <a class="ulink" href="http://xfce.org" target="_top">XFce home page</a>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
  The XFce project was first started because I needed a simple, light and
  efficient environment for my Linux System.
 </p><p>
  I believe that the desktop environment should be made to increase user
  productivity. Therefore, the goal is keep most system resources for the
  applications, and not to consume all memory and CPU usage with the desktop
  environment.
 </p></blockquote></div><p>
 All these have their own extensive documentation. If you can't find what you
 need installed on your system, check the respective home pages.

</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="cli"></a>7. X and the Command Line</h2></div></div></div><p>
 What would a Unix-like operating system be without a command line 
 interface?  The command line can be useful, and is readily available with
 <span class="application">X</span>. In fact, for many it is an integral part 
 of their <span class="application">X</span> working environment. 

</p><p>
 Any <span class="application">X</span> program can be started directly from the
 command line just by typing the program name at a shell prompt in an
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>, or other terminal window. Most applications will
 have a very rich set of command line <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">options</span>&#8221;</span>, such as
 background color, font, geometry (screen placement), etc, etc. Command line
 options over-ride compiled in defaults, or other system enabled
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resources</span>&#8221;</span>.
 
</p><p>
 Many traditional <span class="application">X</span> programs will use the same
 basic names for command line options. All applications written using the 
 MIT X Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt) (such as those included with XFree86)
 automatically accept the following options. Some non-Xt applications also use
 these, or something similar. For instance, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">geometry</span>&#8221;</span> is close 
 to a universally accepted option.
</p><p>
 </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">-display <span class="emphasis"><em>[host]:display[.screen]</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    This option specifies the X server display to use. This is often used 
    where applications are run on one system, and displayed on another. The 
    application needs to know <span class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> to display. This 
    is sometimes also accomplished by setting the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">$DISPLAY</span>&#8221;</span> 
    variable, which uses the same syntax.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-geometry <span class="emphasis"><em>geometry</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    The initial size and location of the window, in a format such as
    <code class="literal">width x height +horz_offset +vert_offset</code> or
    <code class="literal">+horz_offset -vert_offset</code>. Note that if you put in a
    negative horizontal or vertical offset, the window will be placed counting
    backward from the right or the bottom of the screen, respectively, instead
    of from the top left corner.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-font <span class="emphasis"><em>fontname</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    The font to use for displaying the text in your window (see font section
    below).
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-bg <span class="emphasis"><em>color</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    The color to use for the window background. Typically this is a
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">color name</span>&#8221;</span> (see below).
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-fg <span class="emphasis"><em>color</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    The color to use for the window foreground (i.e. fonts, etc).
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-name <span class="emphasis"><em>resource-name</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    Useful for specifying the name under which the resources for this
    application will be found (e.g. as specified in
    <code class="filename">.Xdefaults</code>). This is useful to distinguish between
    invocations of the same application. For example, two
    <span class="command"><strong>xterms</strong></span> can be <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">named</span>&#8221;</span> differently so that
    they may inherit different resources based upon the specified names in
    the resource database.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-title <span class="emphasis"><em>string</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    This is the title to be used for the window on your display, generally used
    by the Window Manager to put a descriptive title at the top of the window.
    Not to be confused with the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">-name</span>&#8221;</span> option.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-iconic</span></dt><dd><p>
    Open window in an iconified state.
   </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-xrm <span class="emphasis"><em>resource-string</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
    This option specifies a resource name and value to override any defaults
    that may already be set (i.e. via <code class="filename">.Xresources</code> or
    similar). Also useful for setting <span class="application">X</span> resources
    that do not have explicit command line options. For example, the command
    line <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xterm -xrm xterm*background: blue &amp;</span>&#8221;</span> is
    functionally the same as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xterm -bg blue &amp;</span>&#8221;</span>.
   </p></dd></dl></div><p>
</p><p>
 These are the most noteworthy. There are others. Many programs will have
 their own additional options that are application specific. Many newer
 applications today don't necessarily adhere to the Xt standards, and will use
 their own options, or those provided by their respective toolkit.
 If nothing else, man pages are a good reference for command syntax, and are
 your friends here. Or, the application will have a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">--usage</span>&#8221;</span> or 
 <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">--help</span>&#8221;</span> command line switch to list available options:

 Sooner or later, most of us need to access the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">command line</span>&#8221;</span> 
 for one reason or another. For some, this might even be a common way of
 working in <span class="application">X</span>. In addition to being able to launch 
 <span class="application">X</span> applications from the command prompt, there
 is also a wealth of programs that run in <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">text mode</span>&#8221;</span> for
 Linux. 

</p><p>
 This is possible via <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">terminal emulators</span>&#8221;</span> such as
 <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>. The closest counterpart from Microsoft is the
 so-called DOS-box, which is child's play by comparison. Linux terminals support
 color, full mouse copy/paste (and some wheeled mice), pseudo-transparency and
 pixmap backgrounds, scrollbars, menus and generally a slew of other 
 features. While <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> is the best known such terminal 
 emulator, there are many similar programs. To name a few:
 <span class="command"><strong>Eterm</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>rxvt</strong></span>,
 <span class="command"><strong>aterm</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>konsole</strong></span>
 (<span class="application">KDE</span>) and <span class="command"><strong>gnome-terminal</strong></span>.

</p><p>
  In typical usage, when a terminal emulator window is opened, a shell is
  started for the user to interact with. The default for essentially all
  Linuxes, is the <span class="application">bash</span> shell. So when all is said
  and done, the user is interacting with <span class="application">X</span>, the
  terminal, and the shell all at once. Each may have it's own influence. For
  example, how keystrokes are handled since they move from hardware to X
  server to terminal to the shell and finally echoed back to the user.

</p><p> 
 Quick and easy terminal configuration is done via the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">$TERM</span>&#8221;</span> 
 variable, which is typically set in one of the user's shell configuration
 files. Or the terminal itself will have a compiled in default. The default
 value for this is most often <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">xterm</span>&#8221;</span>:

</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 $ echo $TERM
 xterm

 </pre><p>
</p><p>
 Normally this is sufficient, as your vendor has already set this up in a
 reasonable way. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">$TERM</span>&#8221;</span> variable is actually a reference to
 an entry in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">termcap</span>&#8221;</span> database (man termcap), which is
 typically installed as <code class="filename">/etc/termcap</code>. Unless you are
 doing something really unusual, you probably will not need to change this.
 Some additional terminal configuration can be done with the
 <span class="command"><strong>stty</strong></span> command (see man page). Terminal configuration is
 really beyond the scope of this document.

</p><p>
 The terminal application itself (e.g. <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>) will also
 have various configuration options. Permanent settings are best stored in 
 a <code class="filename">~/.Xdefaults</code> or similar file for those applications 
 that support this. Generally speaking, applications with a GUI configuration 
 (such as <span class="command"><strong>gnome-terminal</strong></span>), will be configured by their own
 menu driven configuration instead.

</p><p>
 Also, you are interacting with the shell too, which can have it's own impact,
 particularly on how keystrokes are handled at the shell prompt. For
 <span class="application">bash</span>, this can be adjusted in
 <code class="filename">~/.inputrc</code>. Again, this is beyond the scope of this
 document, but check with either local or on-line
 <span class="application">bash</span> (or other shell) references.

</p><p>
 Terminal emulators like <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> require a monospaced font.
 So forget about TrueType or Type 1 fonts. 

</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="xsecurity"></a>8. <span class="application">X</span> Networking and Security</h2></div></div></div><p>
 As mentioned, <span class="application">X</span> is essentially a networking
 protocol with graphical displaying capabilities. This makes for some
 interesting usage possibilities. And also means there are inherent security
 considerations, as there is with any networking environment. And if you ever
 connect to the Internet, you are in the midst of one very large, hostile
 network ;-)

</p><p>
 X clients connect to X servers via various networking protocols, including
 TCP/IP. Even with just local connections. Possible usages here are to run an
 application on one computer, and display it on another. Or, to actually log
 in to a remote system, and have it display to your local screen, with the
 client apps using the remote system's CPU and RAM.

</p><p>
 Without any precautions, this can leave you wide open to various types of
 mischief and abuse. For instance, anyone logged into to your system can
 access your <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>, meaning they can see what you are doing
 if they want to. Thankfully, most recent Linux releases come with some
 default security precautions enabled. But it is best to make sure for
 yourself that you are protected.

</p><p>
 Both <span class="application">X</span> networking and security are nicely covered 
 in <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-X-Apps.html" target="_top">The Remote X Apps Mini HOWTO
</a>, 
 so we shall not need to try to rehash it here. Recommended reading. See other
 references in the <a class="link" href="#links" title="10.2. Links and other References">Links section</a> of the
 Appendix below.

</p><p>
 A few recommended precautions:

</p><p>
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
   Never, ever run <span class="application">X</span> as root. The number of bad
   things that can happen, dramatically increases when logged in as root.
   Learn to run as much as possible as a regular user, and su to root only
   when needed. This may sound like a lot of extra work (and probably is at
   first), but once the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">right</span>&#8221;</span> way of doing things is learned,
   it soon becomes second nature.
   
  </p><p>
   A brief anecdote from a friend: he had a client who's new system stopped 
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">working</span>&#8221;</span>. Curiously, he found the entire
   <code class="filename">/dev</code> directory was missing, which he re-installed and
   all was well again. He was back a few days later and found the system
   logged in as root to <span class="application">X</span>, and someone had clicked
   on <code class="filename">/dev</code> in the file manager, and dragged it onto the
   desktop. Smooth move!

  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   If you ever connect to a network with untrusted users, be sure to have a 
   firewall between you and them. This goes double for the Internet.
   Firewalling is beyond the scope of this document, but is covered in many
   other places, including your vendor's website. <a class="ulink" href="http://linuxdoc.org" target="_top">http://linuxdoc.org</a> has several security
   HOWTOs that can help as well. <a class="ulink" href="http://linuxsecurity.com/docs/" target="_top">http://linuxsecurity.com/docs/</a>
   is another good place to look.

  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   You can disable TCP connections with  the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">-nolisten tcp</span>&#8221;</span>
   command line X server switch. This does not help for local connections
   though. For <span class="command"><strong>xinit/startx</strong></span>:
  </p><p>
   </p><pre class="screen">

</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="performance"></a>9. Performance Considerations</h2></div></div></div><p>
 As has been discussed, what we call <span class="application">X</span>, is actually
 a convergence of various components: X server, Window Manager, Desktop, etc.
 With MS Windows, the GUI desktop is tightly integrated with the operating
 system itself. This is not the case in Linux which follows the Unix tradition
 of combining various independent components to achieve some end result. So we
 have choices with each component and it's attendant configuration and
 implementation. In short, much flexibility. This is where you come in. You
 can try various possibilities and decide what you gives you the most bang for
 the buck.

</p><p>
 On low end hardware, this gives us much latitude to decrease the demand on
 available system resources. This is good because, if given the opportunity,
 <span class="application">X</span> can be quite greedy with system resources. If
 you've recently installed a new Linux distribution, you've probably been
 given a default Desktop with many bells and whistles. And something
 that will probably need a fair amount of memory and CPU to achieve a
 reasonable level of performance. If you have the horse power, this should not
 be a problem.

</p><p>
 It is often said that Linux functions very well with relatively little
 memory. This is true to a point. It does not mean though that every possible
 configuration will run with low memory. So if you want to use memory hungry
 applications, then you will have to have the memory. Or you will have to make
 sacrifices to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. It is quite
 possible to run <span class="application">X</span> with reasonable performance on
 16 Meg of RAM, and even less if you really want to push it. But you would
 have to live with some real limitations.

</p><p>
 Let's look at some of the components and ways to decrease the demand on
 system resources, in case you are at the low end on hardware, or performance
 is not up to expectations.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1265"></a>9.1. Hardware</h3></div></div></div><p>
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
 No big surprise, but overall system performance will be best with a fast
 graphics card, a fast hard drive, and lots and lots of memory -- if you want
 <span class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> a fast and flashy system.

 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Graphics cards are of course necessary, and the X server's video performance
 is tied to the card's chipset, and the corresponding XFree86 driver. Just
 because a given card is supported by XFree86 does not necessarily mean it is
 as well optimized as other cards! It may also perform better at a lower color
 depth (see below). It may well be worth the trip to xfree86.org to see if
 there are any notes related to your card with respect to performance or other
 issues.

 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  And you might try other versions of XFree86. At this time v4.2 was just
  recently released. Some cards may still perform better with 3.3.6 due to the
  way v4.x is being incrementally developed. If you are using x4.x and
  performance is not good, then make sure you are using the latest available
  version.

 </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1276"></a>9.2. Memory</h3></div></div></div><p>
 The more memory, the better. <span class="application">X</span> will do a lot
 caching to help performance. But caching requires memory, and if there isn't
 much to start with, then we would need to reduce memory requirements. Some
 tips for those with low memory or performance problems:
</p><p>
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
 Use the <span class="command"><strong>free</strong></span> command to make sure all memory and swap is
 recognized. 

 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Make sure you don't have other system services that are hogging memory or
 CPU. Use <span class="command"><strong>top</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>ps</strong></span> to see what is
 running, and disable anything you can to free up memory and CPU. Again, a
 default installation may have many things running that you don't really
 need.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Make sure you have plenty of swap space. With low, or even modest, memory,
 swap is all the more important. A general rule of thumb is twice as much swap
 as physical memory. With low memory, this is not enough. Try four times real
 memory. Or more. If you can't create more swap partitions, see the
 <span class="command"><strong>mkswap</strong></span> man page about creating swap files instead.
 Constant disk churning is a symptom of insufficient swap space, and the
 system will be slowed as a result, sometimes drastically. Or, possibly this
 may be the symptom of a poorly behaved kernel VM system (try another kernel
 in this case).

 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Drive performance is important for swap performance. Make sure your drive has
 DMA enabled if the drive supports it, and is otherwise tuned and performing
 up to snuff. See the <span class="command"><strong>hdparm</strong></span> man page. Slow drive + slow
 card + low memory = slow system.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Don't use <span class="application">KDE</span> or <span class="application">GNOME</span>
 if memory is tight. These both require substantial memory, and are not
 required to just run <span class="application">X</span>. Think of these as
 usability enhancements. 32M probably may not be enough. 64M may be decent,
 depending on what other applications are being used, and other variables. 128M
 <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be adequate in most situations. 256M or more to
 be comfortable. File Managers like <span class="application">Nautilus</span> and
 <span class="application">gmc</span> can also be memory hungry. 
 
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Use a lightweight window manger. <span class="application">WindowMaker</span>,
 <span class="application">BlackBox</span>, <span class="application">IceWM</span>,
 <span class="application">fvwm</span> (and variants),
 <span class="application">XFce</span>, all have reputations of performing well with
 low memory. There are surely others as well. Experiment.
 <span class="application">fvwm</span> is generally considered the lightest of the
 light. 
</p><p>
 A very nice desktop is still very possible even without
 <span class="application">KDE</span> or <span class="application">GNOME</span>. In fact,
 most <span class="application">KDE</span> and <span class="application">GNOME</span>
 applications can still be used even if <span class="application">KDE</span> and
 <span class="application">GNOME</span> are not running themselves (assuming the
 right libs are installed).
 
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Don't use fancy themes or backgrounds. Plain and simple is easier on
 resources. Use a solid color background. Avoid pixmaps or gradients for any
 kind of background, including menus, title bars, etc.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Use a lesser screen size and color depth. 800x600x16 will not push
 <span class="application">X</span> as hard and be easier on system resources than
 higher values. While a ColorDepth of 24 is preferred, you probably will not
 notice the difference of 16 with the majority of applications.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Some applications require much more memory than others. Some notable hogs are
 <span class="command"><strong>Netscape</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>Mozilla</strong></span>, office suites, and
 <span class="command"><strong>the Gimp</strong></span>. <span class="command"><strong>Netscape</strong></span> is faster than
 <span class="command"><strong>Mozilla</strong></span> (but not as nice).
 <span class="command"><strong>Netscape-Navigator</strong></span> uses less memory than
 <span class="command"><strong>Netscape-Communicator</strong></span>. Close any of these apps when not in
 use. Use text browsers like <span class="command"><strong>lynx</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>w3m</strong></span>
 wherever you can, like reading locally installed HTML documentation. Much
 faster, and much less memory is required. 
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Also, use text based clients for mail (<span class="command"><strong>mutt</strong></span> or
 <span class="command"><strong>pine</strong></span>) and news (<span class="command"><strong>slrn</strong></span> or
 <span class="command"><strong>trn</strong></span>). Again, faster and much less memory is used, 
 and these are after all text based protocols at heart anyway.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>rxvt</strong></span> uses less memory than <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span>,
 <span class="command"><strong>konsole</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>gnome-terminal</strong></span>.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 If you run an <span class="application">X</span> session for long periods of time
 (like days or weeks), restart <span class="application">X</span> occasionally to
 free memory tied up as cache.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
  Disable <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">backing store</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">save-unders</span>&#8221;</span> to
  reduce memory usage (performance penalty though). Check
  your Window Manager's settings too. See what modules are being loaded 
  in the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Modules</span>&#8221;</span> section of <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> as
  well. Your installation may have many unnecessary ones enabled, or ones you
  can't take advantage of (e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">v4l</span>&#8221;</span>, aka
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Video4Linux</span>&#8221;</span>).
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
  Font servers may provide a slight performance boost by off-loading font
  rendering to the font server, while freeing the X server to do other things.
  But, the font server will use a small additional amount of memory as well.
  So, you can try it either way to see if it makes a difference.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 Lastly, RAM is cheap now. Buy some ;-) A new drive too.
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 RAM is still just too low for <span class="application">X</span>? Check out

 X is not particularly network friendly. In other words, it is a bandwidth
 hog. This should not be a problem in LAN situations, but may be if trying to
 use X over the Internet.
</p><p>
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
     <span class="command"><strong>lbxproxy</strong></span>, the low bandwidth X proxy, utilizes 
     various optimizations to improve performance in low bandwidth, or 
     high latency situations. See the man page.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     VNC (Virtual Network Computing), has some of the same advantages as 
     X for displaying applications on remote systems, but is more network

 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
 Use <span class="command"><strong>xset</strong></span> to speed up the keyboard. This can make the
 system feel more responsive even if it isn't really. The default always
 seemed sluggish to me. 
 </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
 <span class="command"><strong>renice</strong></span> <span class="application">X</span> to give it a higher
 priority. Other platforms give the GUI high scheduling priority to achieve
 better responsiveness. But this is at a cost to other processes. Linux is a
 blank slate. You might include the font server (if being used), and key
 <span class="application">KDE</span> and <span class="application">GNOME</span> processes
 as well. 
</p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">

 nice -n -10 X :0

</p><p>
 This will not do much on systems that are mostly idle.

</p><p>
 This does not work so well with <span class="command"><strong>startx</strong></span> since
 <span class="application">X</span> runs as root, and you are not root, right? So
 you would have to use something like <span class="command"><strong>sudo</strong></span> to have this done
 automatically.

   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X server</span>&#8221;</span> is the low-level driver software that interacts
   with your video card and other system hardware, and manages the 
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> and the various components attached to the
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> (keyboard, mouse, etc.). And, of course, handles 
   requests from clients as well. There are different X servers for different
   chipsets.
  </p><p>
   X Servers are referenced in the form of:
  </p><p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>host.domain:display_number.screen_number</em></span>
  </p><p>
   An example would look like: <span class="emphasis"><em>my_computer:0.0</em></span>

  </p><p>
   If host (and domain) is omitted, localhost is assumed. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Host</span>&#8221;</span>
   can be a remote host. If <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span> is omitted, then
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">0</span>&#8221;</span> (the first screen) is assumed. In it's shortest form, the
   X server is often represented as just <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">:0</span>&#8221;</span>, which would be the
   first local <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>. <span class="application">X</span> supports
   multiple <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> multiple
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screens</span>&#8221;</span>.

  </p><p>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Screen</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Display</span>&#8221;</span> have special meanings in
   relation to X servers, in addition to their more common usage.

  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    When <span class="application">X</span> is invoked, the X server will initialize 
    one or more <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span>. Yes, <span class="application">X</span> can
    have more than one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> available (though this is not a
    common configuration for the average user). Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> is
    a separate instance of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X</span>&#8221;</span>. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>
    includes not only the obvious video components, but also the keyboard,
    mouse and other input type components. The user can only access one
    <span class="application">display</span> at a time via the same keyboard and
    monitor. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Displays</span>&#8221;</span> may reside locally, or on a networked
    host <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">somewhere</span>&#8221;</span>, or both. It is possible that if multiple
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> are available, the user can choose which one he
    wants when he logs in. Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> may have its own
    unique configuration (e.g. resolution). But again, the most typical 
    configuration is just one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> with one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span>, 
    which is how most of us use <span class="application">X</span>.
    
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   In reference to X servers, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span> means the primary video
   output with which you view <span class="application">X</span>.
   And there can be more than one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span>, just like you can
   have more than one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>. Additional
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screens</span>&#8221;</span> are used in <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">multi-headed displays</span>&#8221;</span> for
   instance. In fact you can even have more than one computer running off a
   single X server. This is beyond the scope of this document, but you should
   be aware of this degree of flexibility as it is an important ingredient of
   the <span class="application">X</span> protocol.
   
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop</span>&#8221;</span> can mean different things in different
    contexts. Often, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop</span>&#8221;</span> means what is more properly 
    called the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop Environment</span>&#8221;</span>. Prime examples of this are
    <span class="application">KDE</span>, <span class="application">GNOME</span>, and the not 
    as well-known <span class="application">CDE</span>, which are high level
    applications that control much of how the user interacts with the
    <span class="application">X</span> session. They provide consistent look and
    feel, as well as consistent configuration and come bundled with their own
    set of utilities for common tasks.
  </p><p>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop</span>&#8221;</span> also sometimes just means the viewable screen area.
   This is more of the MS Window's meaning. <span class="application">X</span>
   environments though are capable of having multiple virtual
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktops</span>&#8221;</span> that can be switched between as needed. This helps with
   organizing different tasks. Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop</span>&#8221;</span> may its own windows
   and clients that are specific to it. Right now I have seven
   <span class="application">WindowMaker</span> desktops
   (<span class="application">WindowMaker</span> calls them
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">WorkSpaces</span>&#8221;</span>), and one of those I have dedicated to writing
   this document. This <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop</span>&#8221;</span> has thirteen unique windows at
   the moment (man pages, browser windows, clock, gvim, xterms, etc).
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Clients</span>&#8221;</span> are any program that connect to the X server, and
   require an X server for some task (e.g. to display itself). Often, these
   are displayed in their own <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">window</span>&#8221;</span>, but not always. For
   instance, if I use <code class="literal">CTRL-N</code> to open a new
   <span class="application">Mozilla</span> window, this is one
   <span class="application">X</span> client but with two windows. If I run a command
   line <span class="application">X</span> utility like <span class="command"><strong>xev</strong></span> to
   view key and mouse events, this runs in the <span class="command"><strong>xterm's</strong></span>
   window, so has none of its own, but is still a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">client</span>&#8221;</span>.
   Clients can be locally running applications, or applications that are
   running on another system over the network, but are displayed locally.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Window Manager</span>&#8221;</span> is a special type of client application 
   and a user definable component of the GUI. It is what the user interacts
   with to a large extent. The Window Manager provides such functionality as
   window borders and decorations, menus, icons, virtual desktops, button
   bars, tool bars, and allows the user to customize these. It is technically
   possible to run <span class="application">X</span> without a window manager
   (though not very functional), but not the other way around. Window managers
   should not be confused with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop Environments</span>&#8221;</span> like
   <span class="application">KDE</span>. Desktop Environments include their own
   preferred Window Manager, but this is a configurable. There is some
   overlapping of responsibilities between Window Managers and Desktop
   Environments.
   
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">root window</span>&#8221;</span> is the background of your screen. It is
   referred to as a window in name alone, it does not behave like any other
   window, but rather you run your applications on the root window, or put an
   image on it, or perhaps just a solid color. All other windows are children 
   of this parent window. The root window conceivably can be larger than the viewable 
   screen area.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pointer</span>&#8221;</span> is the arrow or indicator of any
   given shape which represents the location of your mouse, or other pointing
   device. The pointer often changes to give you contextual feedback as to
   what will happen when you use the mouse at that point on the screen. 
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">window</span>&#8221;</span> is a frame in which any given application runs
   and which is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">managed</span>&#8221;</span> by the Window Manager. This includes
   pretty much anything except the so-called root window. Even windows which
   do not appear to have frames, titles, or normal borders of any kind are
   being managed by your window manger. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">active window</span>&#8221;</span> is
   the window you are currently using. This window will respond to the
   keyboard when you type, and is traditionally denoted by the fact that your
   mouse cursor is pointing at it, though this is not always the case. The
   active window is said to have <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">focus</span>&#8221;</span>. Most Window Managers
   will somehow highlight the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">active</span>&#8221;</span>, or focused, window to
   differentiate it from other windows.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Menus</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">icons</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">task bars</span>&#8221;</span>
   behave in <span class="application">X</span> similar to the way they behave in
   other windowing systems, and the same general principles apply. 
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   Windows that run text only applications are called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">terminal
   emulators</span>&#8221;</span>, such as <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> and various 
   similar applications. This is the well-known <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">command line</span>&#8221;</span> in
   an X environment. These basically emulate a console text-only display, and
   have some advantages due to their being used in
   <span class="application">X</span>. These are much more complex and sophisticated
   applications than a simple <span class="application">DOS</span> box on Windows.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Widgets</span>&#8221;</span> is the term used to describe such GUI control
   components as buttons, sliders, menus, scrollbars, listboxes, checkboxes, etc.
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Toolkits</span>&#8221;</span> are libraries containing a diverse set of widgets
   with the same look and feel. Some common examples are
   <span class="application">GTK+</span> (used by <span class="application">GNOME</span>,
   <span class="application">Mozilla</span> and others), <span class="application">Xaw</span> 
   (X Athena Widget set), <span class="application">Tk</span>,
   <span class="application">Motif</span> and <span class="application">QT</span> (used
   by <span class="application">KDE</span>). Applications are built with one toolkit

   toolkits, depending on compile time options.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Window <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">geometry</span>&#8221;</span> is a shorthand way of expressing a window's
    size and screen placement. This might look like
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">60x20+10+50</span>&#8221;</span>, which is <code class="literal">WIDTH x HEIGHT +VERT_OFFSET
