 There are a few basic concepts and terminologies you should be familiar with.
 These terms will appear here, in the manual pages, and in other help files and
 documentation.

   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X server</span>&#8221;</span> is the low-level driver software that interacts
   with your video card and other system hardware, and manages the 
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> and the various components attached to the
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> (keyboard, mouse, etc.). And, of course, handles 
   requests from clients as well. There are different X servers for different
   chipsets.
  </p><p>
   X Servers are referenced in the form of:
  </p><p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>host.domain:display_number.screen_number</em></span>
  </p><p>
   An example would look like: <span class="emphasis"><em>my_computer:0.0</em></span>

  </p><p>
   If host (and domain) is omitted, localhost is assumed. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Host</span>&#8221;</span>
   can be a remote host. If <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span> is omitted, then
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">0</span>&#8221;</span> (the first screen) is assumed. In it's shortest form, the
   X server is often represented as just <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">:0</span>&#8221;</span>, which would be the
   first local <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>. <span class="application">X</span> supports
   multiple <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> multiple
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screens</span>&#8221;</span>.

  </p><p>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Screen</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Display</span>&#8221;</span> have special meanings in
   relation to X servers, in addition to their more common usage.

  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    When <span class="application">X</span> is invoked, the X server will initialize 
    one or more <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span>. Yes, <span class="application">X</span> can
    have more than one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> available (though this is not a
    common configuration for the average user). Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> is
    a separate instance of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">X</span>&#8221;</span>. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>
    includes not only the obvious video components, but also the keyboard,
    mouse and other input type components. The user can only access one
    <span class="application">display</span> at a time via the same keyboard and
    monitor. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Displays</span>&#8221;</span> may reside locally, or on a networked
    host <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">somewhere</span>&#8221;</span>, or both. It is possible that if multiple
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">displays</span>&#8221;</span> are available, the user can choose which one he
    wants when he logs in. Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> may have its own
    unique configuration (e.g. resolution). But again, the most typical 
    configuration is just one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span> with one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span>, 
    which is how most of us use <span class="application">X</span>.
    
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   In reference to X servers, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span> means the primary video
   output with which you view <span class="application">X</span>.
   And there can be more than one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screen</span>&#8221;</span>, just like you can
   have more than one <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">display</span>&#8221;</span>. Additional
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">screens</span>&#8221;</span> are used in <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">multi-headed displays</span>&#8221;</span> for
   instance. In fact you can even have more than one computer running off a
   single X server. This is beyond the scope of this document, but you should
   be aware of this degree of flexibility as it is an important ingredient of
   the <span class="application">X</span> protocol.
   
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop</span>&#8221;</span> can mean different things in different
    contexts. Often, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop</span>&#8221;</span> means what is more properly 
    called the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop Environment</span>&#8221;</span>. Prime examples of this are
    <span class="application">KDE</span>, <span class="application">GNOME</span>, and the not 
    as well-known <span class="application">CDE</span>, which are high level
    applications that control much of how the user interacts with the
    <span class="application">X</span> session. They provide consistent look and
    feel, as well as consistent configuration and come bundled with their own
    set of utilities for common tasks.
  </p><p>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop</span>&#8221;</span> also sometimes just means the viewable screen area.
   This is more of the MS Window's meaning. <span class="application">X</span>
   environments though are capable of having multiple virtual
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktops</span>&#8221;</span> that can be switched between as needed. This helps with
   organizing different tasks. Each <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop</span>&#8221;</span> may its own windows
   and clients that are specific to it. Right now I have seven
   <span class="application">WindowMaker</span> desktops
   (<span class="application">WindowMaker</span> calls them
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">WorkSpaces</span>&#8221;</span>), and one of those I have dedicated to writing
   this document. This <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">desktop</span>&#8221;</span> has thirteen unique windows at
   the moment (man pages, browser windows, clock, gvim, xterms, etc).
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Clients</span>&#8221;</span> are any program that connect to the X server, and
   require an X server for some task (e.g. to display itself). Often, these
   are displayed in their own <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">window</span>&#8221;</span>, but not always. For
   instance, if I use <code class="literal">CTRL-N</code> to open a new
   <span class="application">Mozilla</span> window, this is one
   <span class="application">X</span> client but with two windows. If I run a command
   line <span class="application">X</span> utility like <span class="command"><strong>xev</strong></span> to
   view key and mouse events, this runs in the <span class="command"><strong>xterm's</strong></span>
   window, so has none of its own, but is still a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">client</span>&#8221;</span>.
   Clients can be locally running applications, or applications that are
   running on another system over the network, but are displayed locally.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Window Manager</span>&#8221;</span> is a special type of client application 
   and a user definable component of the GUI. It is what the user interacts
   with to a large extent. The Window Manager provides such functionality as
   window borders and decorations, menus, icons, virtual desktops, button
   bars, tool bars, and allows the user to customize these. It is technically
   possible to run <span class="application">X</span> without a window manager
   (though not very functional), but not the other way around. Window managers
   should not be confused with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Desktop Environments</span>&#8221;</span> like
   <span class="application">KDE</span>. Desktop Environments include their own
   preferred Window Manager, but this is a configurable. There is some
   overlapping of responsibilities between Window Managers and Desktop
   Environments.
   
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">root window</span>&#8221;</span> is the background of your screen. It is
   referred to as a window in name alone, it does not behave like any other
   window, but rather you run your applications on the root window, or put an
   image on it, or perhaps just a solid color. All other windows are children 
   of this parent window. The root window conceivably can be larger than the viewable 
   screen area.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pointer</span>&#8221;</span> is the arrow or indicator of any
   given shape which represents the location of your mouse, or other pointing
   device. The pointer often changes to give you contextual feedback as to
   what will happen when you use the mouse at that point on the screen. 
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">window</span>&#8221;</span> is a frame in which any given application runs
   and which is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">managed</span>&#8221;</span> by the Window Manager. This includes
   pretty much anything except the so-called root window. Even windows which
   do not appear to have frames, titles, or normal borders of any kind are
   being managed by your window manger. The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">active window</span>&#8221;</span> is
   the window you are currently using. This window will respond to the
   keyboard when you type, and is traditionally denoted by the fact that your
   mouse cursor is pointing at it, though this is not always the case. The
   active window is said to have <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">focus</span>&#8221;</span>. Most Window Managers
   will somehow highlight the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">active</span>&#8221;</span>, or focused, window to
   differentiate it from other windows.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Menus</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">icons</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">task bars</span>&#8221;</span>
   behave in <span class="application">X</span> similar to the way they behave in
   other windowing systems, and the same general principles apply. 
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   Windows that run text only applications are called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">terminal
   emulators</span>&#8221;</span>, such as <span class="command"><strong>xterm</strong></span> and various 
   similar applications. This is the well-known <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">command line</span>&#8221;</span> in
   an X environment. These basically emulate a console text-only display, and
   have some advantages due to their being used in
   <span class="application">X</span>. These are much more complex and sophisticated
   applications than a simple <span class="application">DOS</span> box on Windows.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>  
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Widgets</span>&#8221;</span> is the term used to describe such GUI control
   components as buttons, sliders, menus, scrollbars, listboxes, checkboxes, etc.
   <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Toolkits</span>&#8221;</span> are libraries containing a diverse set of widgets
   with the same look and feel. Some common examples are
   <span class="application">GTK+</span> (used by <span class="application">GNOME</span>,
   <span class="application">Mozilla</span> and others), <span class="application">Xaw</span> 
   (X Athena Widget set), <span class="application">Tk</span>,
   <span class="application">Motif</span> and <span class="application">QT</span> (used
   by <span class="application">KDE</span>). Applications are built with one toolkit
   or another. Sometimes the same application can be built with different
   toolkits, depending on compile time options.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Window <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">geometry</span>&#8221;</span> is a shorthand way of expressing a window's
    size and screen placement. This might look like
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">60x20+10+50</span>&#8221;</span>, which is <code class="literal">WIDTH x HEIGHT +VERT_OFFSET
    +HORZ_OFFSET</code>. While both pairs are often specified, it is
    permissible to use just one or the other pair. 
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    In <span class="application">X</span> lingo, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resources</span>&#8221;</span> are
    definable application attributes. Commonly available
    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">resources</span>&#8221;</span> are fonts, colors, size, window title, etc,
    etc.
