>Let me start this section by warning you that securing your machine and
network against malicious attack is a complex art. I do not consider myself
an expert in this field. The following mechanisms I describe
will help. If you are serious about security, then I recommend you do some
research of your own into the subject. There are many good references on the
Internet relating to the security, including the <A
HREF="Security-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Security-HOWTO</A
></P
><P
>An important rule of thumb is:
`<EM
>Don't run servers you don't intend to use</EM
>'.
Many distributions come configured with all sorts of services that are configured and
automatically started. To ensure even a minimum level of safety, you should go
through your <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/inetd.conf</TT
> file. Comment out (<EM
>place a `#' at
the start of the line</EM
>) any entries for services you don't intend to use.
Good candidates are services such as: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shell</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>login</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>exec</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>uucp</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp</TT
> and informational services such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>finger</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>netstat</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>systat</TT
>.</P
><P
>There are all sorts of security and access control mechanisms. I'll now describe
the most elementary:</P

deny certain users from logging into your machine via ftp. When an incoming ftp connection is
received, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/ftpusers</TT
> file is read by the ftp daemon program (<EM
>ftpd</EM
>).
The file is a simple list of those users who are not allowed login. It might look something like:</P
