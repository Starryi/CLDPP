>Appletalk support allows your Linux machine to interwork with Apple networks.
An important use for this is to share resources (such as printers and disks)
between your Linux and Apple computers. Additional software is required;
this is called <EM
>netatalk</EM
>. Wesley Craig <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>netatalk@umich.edu</TT
> represents
a team called the `Research Systems Unix Group' at the University of Michigan.
They have produced the <EM
>netatalk</EM
> package. This product provides software that
implements the Appletalk protocol stack along with some useful utilities.
The <EM
>netatalk</EM
> package will either be supplied with your Linux
distribution, or you will have to ftp it from the home site at

>You may want to edit the `Makefile' before calling <EM
>make</EM
> to
actually compile the software. Specifically, you might want to change
the DESTDIR variable that defines where the files will later be installed.
The default of /usr/local/atalk is fairly safe.</P

Apple machine on the network can share them.</P

You need to run the <EM

Printer Access Protocol Daemon. When you run this program, it will accept
requests from your Apple machines and spool the print job to your local
line printer daemon.</P

the daemon. The syntax of this file is the same as that of your usual

registered with the Appletalk naming protocol NBP.</P
