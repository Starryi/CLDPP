><P
>The `<EM
>Name Resolver</EM
>' is a part of the linux standard library. Its prime
function is to provide a service to convert human-friendly hostnames (like
`<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp.funet.fi</TT
>' ) into machine friendly IP addresses (such as
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>128.214.248.6</TT
>).</P

><P
>You will probably be familiar with the appearance of Internet host
names, but you may not understand how they are constructed or
de-constructed. Internet domain names are hierarchical in nature.
In other words, they have a tree-like structure. A `<EM
>domain</EM
>' is a family, or
group, of names. A `<EM
>domain</EM
>' may be broken down into a
`<EM
>subdomain</EM
>'. A `<EM
>top level domain</EM
>' is a domain that is not a
subdomain. The Top Level Domains are specified in RFC-920. Some
examples of the most common top level domains are:</P
><P
><P

><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"

>COM</DT
><DD
><P
>Commercial Organizations</P
></DD
><DT

></DD
><DT

>Internet-Related Organizations</P
></DD
><DT
>Country Designator</DT
><DD
><P
>These are two- letter codes that
represent a particular country.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
></P
><P
>For historical reasons, most domains belonging to one of the
non-country based top level domains were used by organizations within
the United States (even though the United States also has its own country
code `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.us</TT
>'). This is not true any more for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.com</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.org</TT
>
domains, which are commonly used by non-us companies.</P
><P
>Each of these top level domains has subdomains. The top level
domains based on country name are often next broken down into
subdomains based on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>com</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>edu</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gov</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mil</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>org</TT
> domains. So for example you end up with: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>com.au</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gov.au</TT
> for commercial and government organizations in Australia;
note that this is not a general rule, as actual policies depend on the
naming authority for each domain.</P
><P
>The next level of division usually represents the name of the
organization.  Further subdomains vary in nature. Often the next level
of subdomain is based on the departmental structure of the
organization. It can, however, be based on any criterion considered
reasonable and meaningful by the network administrators of the
organization.</P
><P
>The very left-most portion of the name is always the unique name
assigned to the host machine. It is called the `<EM
>hostname</EM
>'. The
portion of the name to the right of the hostname is called the
`<EM
>domainname</EM
>' and the complete name is called the `<EM
>Fully
Qualified Domain Name</EM
>'.</P
><P
>To use Terrys host as an example, the fully qualified domain name
is `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au</TT
>'. This means that the host name is
`<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>perf</TT
>' and the domain name is `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>no.itg.telstra.com.au</TT
>'. The
domain name is based on a top level domain (based on his country Australia).
And since his email address belongs to a commercial
organization, `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.com</TT
>' is positioned as the next level domain. The name
of the company is (was) `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Telstra</TT
>' . Their internal naming
structure is based on organizational structure. In this case, the
machine belongs to the Information Technology Group  (Network
Operations section).</P
><P
>Usually, the names are much shorter. For example, my ISP is
called ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>systemy.it</TT
>'' . My non-profit organization is called
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>linux.it</TT
>'', without any <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>com</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>org</TT
> subdomain.
My own host is just called ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>morgana.systemy.it</TT
>'' :
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rubini@linux.it</TT
> is a valid email address. Note that the owner
of a domain has the rights to register hostnames as well as subdomains.
For example, the LUG I belongs to uses the domain <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pluto.linux.it</TT
>,
because the owners of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>linux.it</TT
> agreed to open a subdomain for the LUG.</P

>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/resolv.conf</TT

the name resolver code. Its format is quite simple. It is a text file that
has one keyword per line. There are three keywords typically used by the file.
These keywords are:</P

><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT

names to search for a hostname</P
></DD
><DT
>name server</DT
><DD
><P
>This keyword, which may be used many times,
specifies an IP address of a domain name server to
query when resolving names</P
></DD

><P
>This example specifies that the default domain name to append to unqualified
names (ie hostnames supplied without a domain) is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>maths.wu.edu.au</TT

If the host is not found in that domain, it will also try the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>wu.edu.au</TT

domain directly. Two name server entries are supplied. These entries may be
called upon by the name resolver code to resolve the name.</P

circumstances, the following example will work for you:</P

><P

>/etc/hosts</TT
> file is where you put the name and IP
address of local hosts. If you place a host in this file, then you do
not need to query the domain name server to get its IP Address. The
disadvantage of doing this is that if the IP address for that host changes, you must
keep this file up to date yourself . In a well managed
system, the only hostnames that usually appear in this file are an
entry for the loopback interface, and also the local hosts name.</P
