>5.1.1. Current Kernel source(Optional).</A
></H2
><P
>Please note:</P
><P
>The majority of current distributions come with networking enabled.
It may not be required to recompile the kernel. If you are running well known
hardware you should be fine. For example: 3COM NIC, NE2000 NIC, or an
Intel NIC. However, if you find yourself in the position that you do need to
update the kernel, the following information is provided.</P
><P
>Because the kernel you are running now might not yet have support for the
network types or cards that you wish to use,  you will probably need the
kernel source to recompile the kernel with the appropriate
options.</P
><P
>For users of the major distributions such as Redhat, Caldera, Debian, or
Suse, this no longer holds true. As long as you stay within the mainstream of
hardware, there should be no need to recompile your kernel (unless there is a
very specific feature that you need).</P
><P
>You can always obtain the latest kernel source from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/sunsite/kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp.cdrom.com</A
>.
This is not the official site, but they have LOTS of bandwidth and capacity.
The official site is kernel.org, however, please use the above URL if
you can. Please remember that ftp.kernel.org is seriously overloaded. Use a
mirror.</P
><P
>Normally the kernel source will be untarred into the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/usr/src/linux</TT
> directory. For information on how to apply
patches and build the kernel, you should read the <A
HREF="Kernel-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Kernel-HOWTO</A
>.  For information on how
to configure kernel modules, you should read the ``Modules
mini-HOWTO''. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>README</TT
> file found in the kernel
sources and the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Documentation</TT
> directory are very informative:
for the brave reader!</P
><P
>Unless specifically stated, I recommend you stick with
the standard kernel release (the one with the even number as the
second digit in the version number). Development release kernels (the
ones with the odd second digit) may have structural or other changes
that may cause problems working with other software on your
system. If you are uncertain that you could resolve those sorts of
problems, then don't use Development release kernels.</P

>5.1.2. IP Addresses: an Explanation.</A
></H2
><P
>Internet Protocol Addresses are composed of four bytes. The convention is
to write addresses in what is called `dotted decimal notation'. In this form,
each byte is converted to a decimal number, (0-255). It drops any leading
zeros (unless the number is zero) and written with each byte separated by a
`.' character. By convention, each interface of a host or router has an IP
address. It is legal for the same IP address to be used on each interface of a
single machine, but usually each interface will have its own address.</P
><P
>Internet Protocol Networks are contiguous sequences of IP addresses. All
addresses within a network have a number of digits within the address in
common. The portion of the address that is common amongst all addresses
within the network is called the `network portion' of the address. The
remaining digits are called the `host portion'. The number of bits that
are shared by all addresses within a network is called the netmask. It
is the role of the netmask to determine which addresses belong to the network it
is applied to and which don't belong. For example, consider the following:</P

	Network Portion    192.168.110.
	Host portion                  .23
	-----------------  ---------------
	Network Address    192.168.110.0
	Broadcast Address  192.168.110.255
	-----------------  ---------------</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Any address that is 'bitwise anded' with its netmask will reveal the address
of the network that it belongs to. The network address is therefore always the
lowest numbered address within the range of addresses on the network, and
it always has the host portion of the address coded in all zeroes.</P
><P
>The broadcast address is a special address that every host on the network
listens to (in addition to its own unique address). This address is the one
that datagrams are sent to if every host on the network is meant to receive
it. Certain types of data, like routing information and warning messages,
are transmitted to the broadcast address so that every host on the network
can receive it simultaneously. There are two commonly used standards for
the broadcast address. The most widely accepted one is to
use the highest possible address on the network as the broadcast address.
In the above example, this would be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.110.255</TT
>.
For some reason other sites have adopted the convention of using the network address
as the broadcast address. In practice it doesn't matter very much which you use,
but you must make sure that every host on the network is configured with the
same broadcast address.</P
><P
>For administrative reasons (some time early in the development of the IP
protocol), some arbitrary groups of addresses were formed into networks.
These networks were grouped into what are called classes. Classes
provide a number of standard size networks that could be allocated. The ranges
allocated are:</P
