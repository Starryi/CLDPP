></H1
><P
>Routing is a big topic. It is easily possible to write large
volumes of text about the subject. Most of you will have fairly simple routing
requirements; some of you will not. I will cover some basic
fundamentals of routing only.  If you are interested in more detailed
information, then I suggest you refer to the references provided at the
start of this document.</P
><P
>Let's start with a definition. What is IP routing? Here is one
that I'm using:</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"IP Routing is the process by which a host with
multiple network connections decides where to deliver the IP
datagrams that it has received."</SPAN
></P
><P
>It might be useful to illustrate this with an example. Imagine a typical
office router. It might have a PPP link off the Internet, a number of
Ethernet segments feeding the workstations, and another PPP link off to
another office. When the router receives a datagram on any of its network
connections, it uses the routing mechanism to determine which interface
it should send the datagram to next. Simple hosts also need to route. All
Internet hosts have two network devices, one is the loopback interface
described above, and the other is the one it uses to talk to the rest of
the network (perhaps an Ethernet, perhaps a PPP, or an SLIP serial interface).</P
><P
>Ok, so how does routing work ? Each host keeps a special list of routing
rules called a "routing table". This table contains rows which typically
contain at least three fields: the first is a destination address,
the second is the name of the interface where the datagram is to be routed,
and the third is optionally the IP address of another machine that
carries the datagram on its next step through the network. You can see this table
in linux by using the following command:</P
><P
><TABLE

COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>	user% cat /proc/net/route</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>or by using either of the following commands:</P
><P
><TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>	user% /sbin/route -n
	user% netstat -r</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The routing process is fairly simple. The incoming datagram is received,
the destination address (who it is for) is examined, and then it is compared with
each entry in the table. The entry that best matches that address is
selected, and the datagram is forwarded to the specified interface. If the
gateway field is filled, then the datagram is forwarded to that host via
the specified interface. The destination address is otherwise assumed to
be on the network supported by the interface.</P
><P
>To manipulate this table, a special command is used. This command takes
command line arguments and converts them into kernel system calls. These
calls request the kernel to add, delete, or modify entries in the routing table.
The command is called `<EM
>route</EM
>'.</P
><P
>Here is a simple example. Imagine you have an Ethernet network. You've been told
it is a class-C network with an address of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.0</TT
>. You've been
supplied with an IP address of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.10</TT
> for your use, and you have
been told that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.1</TT
> is a router connected to the Internet.</P
><P
>The first step is to configure the interface as described earlier. You would
use a command similar to the following:</P

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>You now need to add an entry into the routing table to tell the kernel that
datagrams for all hosts with addresses that match <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.*</TT
> should
be sent to the ethernet device. You would use a command similar to:</P
><P

><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"

>	root# route add -net 192.1Ethernetetmask 255.255.255.0 eth0</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Note the use of the `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-net</TT
>' argument to tell the route program that this
entry is a network route. Your other choice here is a `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-host</TT
>' route, which
is a route that is specific to one IP address.</P
><P
>This route will enable you to establish IP connections with all of the hosts
on your ethernet segment. But what about all of the IP hosts that aren't on
your ethernet segment?</P
><P
>It would be a very difficult job to have to add routes to every possible
destination network. There is a special trick that is used to simplify this
task. The trick is called the `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
>' route. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route
matches every possible destination (but poorly).  If any other entry
exists that matches the required address, it will be used instead of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route. The idea of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route is simply to enable
you to say in effect: "and everything else should go here". In this example
you would use an entry like:</P

></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gw</TT
>' argument tells the route command that the next argument is
the IP address, or name, of a gateway or router machine. This machine is where all datagrams
matching the entry should be directed to for further routing.                      on them</P

><P
>If you take a close look at your network `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc</TT
>' files, you will find
that at least one of them looks very similar to this configuration (a very common
one).</P
><P
>Let's now look at a slightly more complicated routing configuration. Let's
imagine we are configuring the router we looked at earlier (the one supporting
the PPP link to the Internet, and the lan segments feeding the workstations in
the office). Lets imagine the router has three ethernet segments, and it also has
one PPP link. Our routing configuration would look something like the fEthernet:</P

	root# route add -net 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth2
	root# route add default ppp0</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Each of the workstations would use the simpler form presented
above. Only the router needs to specify each of the network routes
separately.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route for the workstations
mechanism will capture all of them, letting the router worry about
splitting them up appropriately. You may be wondering why the default
route presented doesn't specify a `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gw</TT
>'.  The reason for this is
simple: serial link protocols such as PPP and SLIP only have two
hosts on  their network (one at each end). To specify the host at the
other end of the link as the gateway is both pointless and redundant.
You do not need to specify a gateway for these types of network connections as there is
no other choice. Other network types, such as
ethernet, arcnet, or token ring, do actually require the gateway to be specified
(as these networks support Ethernetmbers of hosts ).

>The routing configuration described above is best suited for simple network
arrangements where there are only single possible paths to destinations.
When you have a more complex network arrangement, things get a little more
complicated. Fortunately for most of you this won't be an issue.</P
><P
>The big problem with `manual routing' or `static routing' is
that if a machine or link fails in your network, the only way to
re-direct your datagrams (if another way in fact exists) is by manually
intervening and executing the appropriate commands. Naturally this is
clumsy, slow, impractical, and hazard prone. Various techniques have been
developed to automatically adjust routing tables in the event of network
failures (where there are alternate routes). All of these techniques are
loosely grouped by the term `dynamic routing protocols'.</P
><P
>You may have heard of some of the more common dynamic routing protocols. The
most common are probably RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and OSPF (Open
Shortest Path First Protocol). The Routing Information Protocol is very common
on small networks (such as small-medium sized corporate networks or building
networks). OSPF is more modern. It is more capable at handling large network
configurations, and it is better suited to environments where there is a large number
of possible paths through the network. Common implementations of these
protocols are: `<EM
>routed</EM
>' - RIP and `<EM
>gated</EM
>' - RIP, OSPF and others.
The `<EM
>routed</EM
>' program is normally supplied with your Linux distribution,
or it is included in the `NetKit' package detailed above.</P
><P
>An example of where and how you might use a dynamic routing protocol might
look something like the following:</P

>We have three routers A, B and C. Each router supports one ethernet segment with
a Class C IP network (netmask 255.255.255.0). Each one also has a PPP link

>This would work just fine until the link between router A and B fails.
Hosts on the ethernet segment of A (see above diagram) could not reach hosts on the
ethernet segment on B:  their datagramEthernete directed to router As ppp0 link
(which in this example is broEthernetey could still continue to talk to hosts on the ethernet segment
of C. And hosts on CCsethernet segment could still talk to hosts on
BBsethernet segment. TheEthernetnications can still occur because the link between B
and C is still intact.</P
><P
>If A can talk to C, and C can still talk to B, why shouldn't A
route its datagrams for B via C (and let C send them to B) ? This is exactly
the sort of problem that dynamic routing protocols like RIP were designed
to solve. If each of the routers A, B and C were running a routing daemon,
then their routing tables would be automatically adjusted to reflect the
new state of the network (should any one of the links in the network fail).
To configure such a network is simple: at each router you need only do
two things. In this case for Router A:</P
