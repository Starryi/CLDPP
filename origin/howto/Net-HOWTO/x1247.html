>Firewall-HOWTO</A
>. IP Firewalling allows
you to secure your machine against unauthorized network access by filtering
or allowing datagrams from or to IP addresses that you nominate. There are
three different classes of rules; incoming filtering, outgoing filtering, and
forwarding filtering. Incoming rules are applied to datagrams that are
received by a network device. Outgoing rules are applied to datagrams that
are to be transmitted by a network device. Forwarding rules are applied to
datagrams that are received and are not for this machine (ie. datagrams that
would be routed).</P

>Configuration of the IP firewall rules is performed using the <EM

command. As I mentioned earlier, I am not a security expert.
 I will present an example you can use. You should, however, do your own
research and develop your own rules.</P

>Using your linux machine as a router and firewall gateway to protect your local
network from unauthorized access (from outside your network) is probably the most
common use of an IP firewall.</P

They would be automatically started each time the system
boots. For maximum security, they would be performed after the network
interfaces are configured (but before the interfaces are actually
brought up) to prevent anyone gaining access while the firewall machine
is rebooting.</P

>Good firewall configurations are a little tricky. This example
should be a reasonable starting point for you. The <EM

manual page offers some assistance in how to use the tool. If
you intend to configure a firewall, be sure to ask around and
get as much advice from sources you consider reliable. Get
someone to test/sanity check your configuration from the outside.</P
