>Chapter 2. Document History</H1
><P
>The original NET-FAQ was written by Matt Welsh and Terry Dawson. NET-FAQ
answered frequently asked questions about networking for Linux (at a time
before the Linux Documentation Project had formally started). This document
covered the very early development versions of the Linux Networking
Kernel. The NET-2-HOWTO superseded the NET-FAQ, and it was one of the
original LDP HOWTO documents. It covered what was called "version 2" (and
subsequently "version 3") of the Linux kernel Networking software. NET-2_HOWTO
in turn superseded it, and relates only to version 4 of the Linux
Networking Kernel (ie: kernel releases 2.x and 2.2.x. ).</P
><P
>Previous versions of this document became quite large because of
the enormous amount of material that fell within its scope. To help
reduce this problem, a number of HOWTOs dealing with specific
networking topics have been produced. This document will provide
pointers to them where relevant, and it will cover those areas not yet reviewed
by other documents.</P

><P
>This document is organized top-down. The first sections include
informative material, and it can be skipped if you are not interested;
what follows is a generic discussion of networking issues, and you
must ensure you understand this before proceeding to more specific
parts. The ``technology specific'' information is grouped into
three main sections: Ethernet and IP-related information, technologies
pertaining to widespread PC hardware, and seldom-used technologies.</P
><P
>The suggested path through this document is as follows:</P

></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Read the generic sections:</DT
><DD
><P
>These sections apply to almost  every technology described in
subsequent sections, and they are very important for you to understand.
I expect many of the readers will be confident with this material.</P
></DD
><DT
>Consider your network:</DT
><DD
><P
>You should know how your network is (or will be)
designed, and you should also be familiar with
exactly what hardware and technology types you will be implementing.</P
></DD
><DT
>If you are directly connected to a LAN or the Internet,
please refer to the ``Ethernet and IP'' section:</DT
><DD
><P
>This section describes basic Ethernet configurations, and it describes
the various features that Linux offers for IP networking (ie: firewalling,
advanced routing, etc).</P
></DD
><DT
>If you are interested in low-cost local
networks or dial-up connections, please refer to the next section</DT
><DD
><P
>This section describes the widespread technologies used on personal
workstations (ie: PLIP, PPP, SLIP, and ISDN).</P
></DD
><DT
>Please refer to the technology-specific sections
that are related to your requirements:</DT
><DD
><P
>Your needs may differ from IP and/or other common
hardware This final section covers details specific to both
non-IP protocols and to peculiar communication hardware.</P
></DD
><DT
>Do the configuration work:</DT
><DD
><P
>You should actually try to
configure your network. Take careful note of
any existing problems</P
></DD
><DT
>Look for further help:</DT
><DD
><P
>If you experience problems that this document does not
help you to resolve, then you should refer to the sections
related to "Help" and "Where to report bugs".</P

>3.1. Conventions used in this document</A
></H2
><P
>No special conventions are used here, but you must be warned about
the way commands are shown. This howto follows the classic Unix documentation:
any command you type to your shell is prefixed by a
prompt. It shows "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>user%</TT
>" as the prompt for commands
that do not require superuser privileges, and "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root#</TT
>" as the
prompt for commands that need to run as root. I chose to use
"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root#</TT
>" instead of a plain "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#</TT
>" to prevent confusion
with snapshots from shell scripts (where the hash mark is used to
define comment lines).</P
><P
>When ``Kernel Compile Options'' are shown, they are represented in
the format used by <EM
>menuconfig</EM
>. They should be understandable even
if you (like me) are not used to <EM
>menuconfig</EM
>. If you are
in doubt about the options' nesting, then running the program once can
always help.

It may not be required to recompile the kernel. If you are running well known

Intel NIC. However, if you find yourself in the position that you do need to
update the kernel, the following information is provided.</P

network types or cards that you wish to use,  you will probably need the
kernel source to recompile the kernel with the appropriate
options.</P

>For users of the major distributions such as Redhat, Caldera, Debian, or
Suse, this no longer holds true. As long as you stay within the mainstream of
hardware, there should be no need to recompile your kernel (unless there is a
very specific feature that you need).</P

This is not the official site, but they have LOTS of bandwidth and capacity.
The official site is kernel.org, however, please use the above URL if

>5.1.2. IP Addresses: an Explanation.</A
></H3
><P
>Internet Protocol Addresses are composed of four bytes. The convention is
to write addresses in what is called `dotted decimal notation'. In this form,
each byte is converted to a decimal number, (0-255). It drops any leading
zeros (unless the number is zero) and written with each byte separated by a
`.' character. By convention, each interface of a host or router has an IP
address. It is legal for the same IP address to be used on each interface of a
single machine, but usually each interface will have its own address.</P
><P
>Internet Protocol Networks are contiguous sequences of IP addresses. All
addresses within a network have a number of digits within the address in
common. The portion of the address that is common amongst all addresses
within the network is called the `network portion' of the address. The
remaining digits are called the `host portion'. The number of bits that
are shared by all addresses within a network is called the netmask. It
is the role of the netmask to determine which addresses belong to the network it
is applied to and which don't belong. For example, consider the following:</P

></P
><P
>Any address that is 'bitwise anded' with its netmask will reveal the address
of the network that it belongs to. The network address is therefore always the
lowest numbered address within the range of addresses on the network, and
it always has the host portion of the address coded in all zeroes.</P
><P
>The broadcast address is a special address that every host on the network
listens to (in addition to its own unique address). This address is the one
that datagrams are sent to if every host on the network is meant to receive
it. Certain types of data, like routing information and warning messages,
are transmitted to the broadcast address so that every host on the network
can receive it simultaneously. There are two commonly used standards for
the broadcast address. The most widely accepted one is to
use the highest possible address on the network as the broadcast address.
In the above example, this would be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.110.255</TT
>.
For some reason other sites have adopted the convention of using the network address
as the broadcast address. In practice it doesn't matter very much which you use,
but you must make sure that every host on the network is configured with the
same broadcast address.</P
><P
>For administrative reasons (some time early in the development of the IP
protocol), some arbitrary groups of addresses were formed into networks.
These networks were grouped into what are called classes. Classes
provide a number of standard size networks that could be allocated. The ranges
allocated are:</P

><P
>In many Unix operating systems, the network devices have appearances in the
<EM
>/dev</EM
> directory. This is not so in Linux. In Linux, the network devices
are created dynamically in software, and they do not require device files to
be present.</P
><P
>In the majority of cases, the network device is automatically created by the
device driver (while it is initializing and locating your hardware). For
example, the Ethernet device driver creates <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eth[0..n]</TT
> interfaces
sequentially as it locates your Ethernet hardware. The first Ethernet card
found becomes <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eth0</TT
>, the second <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eth1</TT
> etc.</P
><P
>In some cases though, notably with <EM
>slip</EM
> and <EM
>ppp</EM
>, the network devices
are created through the action of some user program. The same sequential
device numbering applies, but the devices are not created automatically
at boot time. The reason for this is that unlike Ethernet devices, the number
of active <EM
>slip</EM
> or <EM
>ppp</EM
> devices may vary during the uptime of the
machine. These cases will be covered in more detail in later sections.

>When you have all of the programs you need (and your address and network
information), you can configure your network interfaces. When we talk about
configuring a network interface, we are talking about two items. One is the process of assigning
appropriate addresses to a network device. The second is setting the appropriate values
for other configurable parameters of a network device. The program most
commonly used to do this is the <EM
>ifconfig</EM

The `<EM

you may specify the network address and broadcast address for an interface.
If you don't  (as in my example above), then the kernel will make reasonable
guesses as to what these addresses should be. If you don't supply a netmask
then on the network class of the IP address is auto-configured.
In my example, the kernel would assume that it is a class-C network that is
being configured on the interface. It would thus configure a network address of
`<TT

function is to provide a service to convert human-friendly hostnames (like

>You will probably be familiar with the appearance of Internet host
names, but you may not understand how they are constructed or
de-constructed. Internet domain names are hierarchical in nature.
In other words, they have a tree-like structure. A `<EM
>domain</EM
>' is a family, or
group, of names. A `<EM
>domain</EM
>' may be broken down into a
`<EM
>subdomain</EM
>'. A `<EM
>top level domain</EM
>' is a domain that is not a
subdomain. The Top Level Domains are specified in RFC-920. Some
examples of the most common top level domains are:</P

represent a particular country.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
></P
><P
>For historical reasons, most domains belonging to one of the
non-country based top level domains were used by organizations within
the United States (even though the United States also has its own country
code `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.us</TT
>'). This is not true any more for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.com</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.org</TT
>
domains, which are commonly used by non-us companies.</P
><P
>Each of these top level domains has subdomains. The top level
domains based on country name are often next broken down into
subdomains based on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>com</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>edu</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gov</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mil</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>org</TT
> domains. So for example you end up with: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>com.au</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gov.au</TT
> for commercial and government organizations in Australia;
note that this is not a general rule, as actual policies depend on the
naming authority for each domain.</P
><P
>The next level of division usually represents the name of the
organization.  Further subdomains vary in nature. Often the next level
of subdomain is based on the departmental structure of the
organization. It can, however, be based on any criterion considered
reasonable and meaningful by the network administrators of the
organization.</P
><P
>The very left-most portion of the name is always the unique name
assigned to the host machine. It is called the `<EM
>hostname</EM
>'. The
portion of the name to the right of the hostname is called the
`<EM
>domainname</EM
>' and the complete name is called the `<EM
>Fully
Qualified Domain Name</EM
>'.</P
><P
>To use Terrys host as an example, the fully qualified domain name
is `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au</TT
>'. This means that the host name is
`<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>perf</TT
>' and the domain name is `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>no.itg.telstra.com.au</TT
>'. The
domain name is based on a top level domain (based on his country Australia).
And since his email address belongs to a commercial
organization, `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.com</TT
>' is positioned as the next level domain. The name
of the company is (was) `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Telstra</TT
>' . Their internal naming
structure is based on organizational structure. In this case, the
machine belongs to the Information Technology Group  (Network
Operations section).</P
><P
>Usually, the names are much shorter. For example, my ISP is
called ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>systemy.it</TT
>'' . My non-profit organization is called
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>linux.it</TT
>'', without any <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>com</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>org</TT
> subdomain.
My own host is just called ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>morgana.systemy.it</TT
>'' :
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rubini@linux.it</TT
> is a valid email address. Note that the owner
of a domain has the rights to register hostnames as well as subdomains.
For example, the LUG I belongs to uses the domain <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pluto.linux.it</TT
>,
because the owners of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>linux.it</TT

>5.7. Routing.</A
></H2
><P
>Routing is a big topic. It is easily possible to write large
volumes of text about the subject. Most of you will have fairly simple routing
requirements; some of you will not. I will cover some basic
fundamentals of routing only.  If you are interested in more detailed
information, then I suggest you refer to the references provided at the
start of this document.</P
><P
>Let's start with a definition. What is IP routing? Here is one
that I'm using:</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"IP Routing is the process by which a host with
multiple network connections decides where to deliver the IP
datagrams that it has received."</SPAN
></P
><P
>It might be useful to illustrate this with an example. Imagine a typical
office router. It might have a PPP link off the Internet, a number of
Ethernet segments feeding the workstations, and another PPP link off to
another office. When the router receives a datagram on any of its network
connections, it uses the routing mechanism to determine which interface
it should send the datagram to next. Simple hosts also need to route. All
Internet hosts have two network devices, one is the loopback interface
described above, and the other is the one it uses to talk to the rest of
the network (perhaps an Ethernet, perhaps a PPP, or an SLIP serial interface).</P
><P
>Ok, so how does routing work ? Each host keeps a special list of routing
rules called a "routing table". This table contains rows which typically
contain at least three fields: the first is a destination address,
the second is the name of the interface where the datagram is to be routed,
and the third is optionally the IP address of another machine that
carries the datagram on its next step through the network. You can see this table
in linux by using the following command:</P
><P
><TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>	user% cat /proc/net/route</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>or by using either of the following commands:</P
><P
><TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>	user% /sbin/route -n
	user% netstat -r</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The routing process is fairly simple. The incoming datagram is received,
the destination address (who it is for) is examined, and then it is compared with
each entry in the table. The entry that best matches that address is
selected, and the datagram is forwarded to the specified interface. If the
gateway field is filled, then the datagram is forwarded to that host via
the specified interface. The destination address is otherwise assumed to
be on the network supported by the interface.</P
><P
>To manipulate this table, a special command is used. This command takes
command line arguments and converts them into kernel system calls. These
calls request the kernel to add, delete, or modify entries in the routing table.
The command is called `<EM
>route</EM
>'.</P
><P
>Here is a simple example. Imagine you have an Ethernet network. You've been told
it is a class-C network with an address of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.0</TT
>. You've been
supplied with an IP address of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.10</TT
> for your use, and you have
been told that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.1</TT
> is a router connected to the Internet.</P
><P
>The first step is to configure the interface as described earlier. You would
use a command similar to the following:</P
><P

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>You now need to add an entry into the routing table to tell the kernel that
datagrams for all hosts with addresses that match <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.*</TT
> should
be sent to the ethernet device. You would use a command similar to:</P

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Note the use of the `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-net</TT
>' argument to tell the route program that this
entry is a network route. Your other choice here is a `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-host</TT
>' route, which
is a route that is specific to one IP address.</P
><P
>This route will enable you to establish IP connections with all of the hosts
on your ethernet segment. But what about all of the IP hosts that aren't on
your ethernet segment?</P
><P
>It would be a very difficult job to have to add routes to every possible
destination network. There is a special trick that is used to simplify this
task. The trick is called the `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
>' route. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route
matches every possible destination (but poorly).  If any other entry
exists that matches the required address, it will be used instead of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route. The idea of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route is simply to enable
you to say in effect: "and everything else should go here". In this example
you would use an entry like:</P

></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gw</TT

the IP address, or name, of a gateway or router machine. This machine is where all datagrams
matching the entry should be directed to for further routing.                      on them</P

><P
>Let's now look at a slightly more complicated routing configuration. Let's
imagine we are configuring the router we looked at earlier (the one supporting
the PPP link to the Internet, and the lan segments feeding the workstations in
the office). Lets imagine the router has three ethernet segments, and it also has
one PPP link. Our routing configuration would look something like the fEthernet:</P

	root# route add default ppp0</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Each of the workstations would use the simpler form presented
above. Only the router needs to specify each of the network routes
separately.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT
> route for the workstations
mechanism will capture all of them, letting the router worry about
splitting them up appropriately. You may be wondering why the default
route presented doesn't specify a `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gw</TT
>'.  The reason for this is
simple: serial link protocols such as PPP and SLIP only have two
hosts on  their network (one at each end). To specify the host at the
other end of the link as the gateway is both pointless and redundant.
You do not need to specify a gateway for these types of network connections as there is
no other choice. Other network types, such as
ethernet, arcnet, or token ring, do actually require the gateway to be specified
(as these networks support Ethernetmbers of hosts ).

><P
>The routing configuration described above is best suited for simple network
arrangements where there are only single possible paths to destinations.
When you have a more complex network arrangement, things get a little more
complicated. Fortunately for most of you this won't be an issue.</P
><P
>The big problem with `manual routing' or `static routing' is
that if a machine or link fails in your network, the only way to
re-direct your datagrams (if another way in fact exists) is by manually
intervening and executing the appropriate commands. Naturally this is
clumsy, slow, impractical, and hazard prone. Various techniques have been
developed to automatically adjust routing tables in the event of network
failures (where there are alternate routes). All of these techniques are
loosely grouped by the term `dynamic routing protocols'.</P
><P
>You may have heard of some of the more common dynamic routing protocols. The
most common are probably RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and OSPF (Open
Shortest Path First Protocol). The Routing Information Protocol is very common
on small networks (such as small-medium sized corporate networks or building
networks). OSPF is more modern. It is more capable at handling large network
configurations, and it is better suited to environments where there is a large number
of possible paths through the network. Common implementations of these
protocols are: `<EM
>routed</EM
>' - RIP and `<EM
>gated</EM
>' - RIP, OSPF and others.
The `<EM
>routed</EM
>' program is normally supplied with your Linux distribution,
or it is included in the `NetKit' package detailed above.</P

Hosts on the ethernet segment of A (see above diagram) could not reach hosts on the
ethernet segment on B:  their datagramEthernete directed to router As ppp0 link

of C. And hosts on CCsethernet segment could still talk to hosts on
BBsethernet segment. TheEthernetnications can still occur because the link between B
and C is still intact.</P

>If A can talk to C, and C can still talk to B, why shouldn't A
route its datagrams for B via C (and let C send them to B) ? This is exactly
the sort of problem that dynamic routing protocols like RIP were designed
to solve. If each of the routers A, B and C were running a routing daemon,
then their routing tables would be automatically adjusted to reflect the
new state of the network (should any one of the links in the network fail).
To configure such a network is simple: at each router you need only do
two things. In this case for Router A:</P

>Network servers and services are programs that allow a remote user to
make use of your Linux machine. Server programs listen on network ports.
Network ports are a means of addressing a particular service on any particular
host. They are how a server knows the difference between an incoming telnet
connection and an incoming ftp connection. The remote user establishes a
network connection to your machine. The server program (the network daemon
program) listening on that port accepts the connection and then executes. There are
two ways that network daemons may operate. Both are commonly employed in
practice. The two ways are:</P

#
#&#62; Ports are used in the TCP [45,106] to name the ends of logical

#&#62; providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is
#&#62; defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as its

With the standard kernel source, you may have
only one EQL device per machine. EQL provides a means of utilizing multiple
Point-to-Point lines such as PPP, slip, or plip as a single logical link to
carry tcp/ip. Often it is cheaper to use multiple lower speed lines than to
have one high speed line installed.</P

><P
>Configuration is fairly straightforward. You start by configuring the eql
interface. The eql interface is just like any other network device. You
configure the IP address and mtu using the <EM

is an example:</P

be any combination of Point-to-Point network devices. How you initiate the
connections will depend on what sort of link they are. Refer to the
appropriate sections for further information.</P
><P
>Lastly you need to associate the serial link with the EQL device. This is
called `enslaving' : it is done with the <EM

you to secure your machine against unauthorized network access by filtering
or allowing datagrams from or to IP addresses that you nominate. There are
three different classes of rules; incoming filtering, outgoing filtering, and
forwarding filtering. Incoming rules are applied to datagrams that are
received by a network device. Outgoing rules are applied to datagrams that
are to be transmitted by a network device. Forwarding rules are applied to
datagrams that are received and are not for this machine (ie. datagrams that
would be routed).</P

>"But why ?". Ok, ok. Conventional IP routing rules mandate that an IP network
comprises a network address and a network mask. This produces a series of
contiguous addresses that may all be routed via a single routing entry.
This is very convenient. It means that you may use any particular
IP address while you are connected to its piece of the network.
In most instances this is ok. If you are a mobile netizen, however, then
you may not be able to stay connected to the one place all the time. IP/IP
encapsulation (IP tunneling) allows you to overcome this restriction by
allowing datagrams destined for your IP address to be wrapped up and redirected
to another IP address. If you know that you're going to be operating from another
IP network, you can set up a machine on your home network
to accept datagrams to your IP address. You can then redirect these datagrams to the address
that you will be temporarily using.</P

>The diagram illustrates another possible reason to use IPIP encapsulation;
virtual private networking. This example presupposes that you have two machines,
each with a simple dial up Internet connection. Each host is allocated just
a single IP address. Behind each of these machines are some private local area
networks. These LANs are configured with reserved IP network addresses. Suppose that you want
to allow any host on network A to connect to any host on network B (just as
if they were properly connected to the Internet with a network route). IPIP
encapsulation will allow you to do this configuration. Note: encapsulation does not solve
the problem of how you get the hosts on networks A and B to talk to any
other on the Internet. You will still need to use tricks like IP Masquerade.
Encapsulation is normally performed by machines functioning as routers.</P

>Many people have a simple dialup account to connect to the Internet. Nearly
everybody using this sort of configuration is allocated a single IP address
by the Internet Service Provider. This is normally enough to allow only one
host full access to the network. IP Masquerade is a clever trick that enables
you to have many machines make use of that one IP address. It causes the
other hosts to look like the machine supporting the dial-up connection. This is
where the term masquerade applies. There is a small caveat: the
masquerade function usually works only in one direction. That is, the
masqueraded hosts can make calls out, but they cannot accept or receive
network connections from remote hosts. This means that some network services
do not work (such as <EM

<EM

in passive (PASV) mode to operate. Fortunately, the most common network services such as

move its network connection from one point on the Internet to another (without
changing its IP address or losing connectivity). Usually when an IP host
changes its point of connectivity, it must also change its IP address.
IP Mobility overcomes this problem by allocating a fixed IP address to the
mobile host. It also uses IP encapsulation (tunneling) with automatic routing
to ensure that datagrams destined for it are routed to the actual IP address
it is currently using.</P

255.255.255.255 into the local subnet broadcast address (in this case,
the address would be 192.5.5.223).  This results in a DHCP protocol violation. While
many DHCP clients don't notice the problem, some (e.g., all Microsoft
DHCP clients) will recognize the violation.  Clients that have this problem will appear not to
see DHCPOFFER messages from the server.</P

>In the newer kernels (2.1 and above), you have another option. This option is
rule based, and it allows you to have multiple routing tables. The new rules
allow a great deal of flexibility in deciding how a packet is handled. You
can choose between routes based not only on the destination address,
but also on the source address, TOS, or incoming device.</P

></H2
><P
>The IP Network Address Translation facility is pretty much the standardized
"big brother" of the Linux IP Masquerade facility. It is specified in some detail
in RFC-1631 (at your nearest RFC archive). NAT provides features that
IP-Masquerade does not (which make it eminently more suitable for use in both
corporate firewall router designs, and in larger scale installations).</P
><P
>An alpha implementation of NAT for Linux 2.0.29 kernel has been developed by
Michael.Hasenstein: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Michael.Hasenstein@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de</TT

documentation and implementation are available from:</P

>Linux IP Network Address Web Page</A

><P
>The much improved TCP/IP stack of Linux 2.2 kernel has NAT functionality
built-in. This facility seems to render the work by Michael Hasenstein somewhat obsolete
(Michael.Hasenstein@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de).</P
><P
>To get it to work, you need the kernel with enabled CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER,
CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES (aka policy routing) and CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_NAT (aka
fast NAT). And if you want to use finer grained NAT rules, you may also
want to turn on firewalling (CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL) and CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_FWMARK.
To actually operate these kernel features, you will need the "ip" program by
Alexey Kuznyetsov from ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/.</P
><P
>Incoming datagrams NAT</P
><P
>Now, to translate addresses of incoming datagrams, the following command is
used:</P

from outside Internet) to have its destination address field rewritten to
"int-addr" (the address in your internal network, behind your

table. You can translate either single host addresses or complete blocks.

>The amount of possible options allowed on each object type depend on the
type of action being taken. As a basic rule, it is possible to <EM

<EM

additional commands to be used. Of course, command help is available for all
objects. When help is used, it will print out a list of available sytanx conventions
for the given object.</P
><P
>If you do not give a command, the default command will be assumed. Typically the
default command is to list the objects. If the objects can not be listed, the default will
provide standard help output.</P
><P
><EM
>ARGUMENTS</EM
> is the list of arguments that can be passed to the command.
The number of arguments depends upon both the command and the object being used.
There are two types of arguments:</P
><P
><EM
>Flags</EM
> consist of a keyword followed by a
value. For convenience, each command contains some default parameters that can be
left out for easier use. For example, the parameter <EM
>dev&#62;</EM
> defaults to an <EM
>ip link</EM
>.</P
><P
><EM
>Mistakes... thank God for smart coders!</EM
>
All the operations within the ip commands are dynamic. If the sytanx of the ip utility fails, it will not change the configuration of the system.
There is an exception to this rule: the <EM
>ip link</EM
> command. This command is
used to change part of a devices parameters.</P
><P
>It is difficult to list all the error messages (especially the syntax errors). Generally speaking,  their meaning is clear in the
context of the commands.
The most common mistakes are:
1.
Netlink is not configured in the kernel. The message is:
Cannot open netlink socket: Invalid value</P
><P
>2.
RTNETLINK is not configured in the kernel. One of the following messages may be printed
(depending upon the command):
Cannot talk to rtnetlink: Connection refused Cannot send dump request: Connection refused</P
><P
>3.
Option CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES was not selected when configuring kernel. In this case, any attempt to
use commandip rule will fail.  For example:</P

>11.1. ISDN</A
></H2
><P
>The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a series of standards
that specify a general purpose switched digital data network. An ISDN `call'
creates a synchronous Point-to-Point data service to the destination. ISDN
is generally delivered on a high speed link that is broken down into a number
of discrete channels. There are two different types of channels, the
`B Channels' (which will actually carry the user data) and a single channel
called the `D channel' (which is used to send control information to the ISDN
exchange: used for establishing calls and other functions). In Australia, for example,
ISDN may be delivered on a 2Mbps link that is broken into 30 discrete 64kbps
B channels (with one 64kbps D channel). Any number of channels may be used at a
time, and these channels can be used in any combination. You could, for example, establish 30 separate calls
to 30 different destinations at 64kbps each. You could also establish 15 calls
to 15 different destinations at 128kbps each (two channels used per call).
Finally, you could establish just a small number of calls while leaving the rest idle. A channel may be used
for either incoming or outgoing calls. The original intention of ISDN was to
allow Telecommunications companies to provide a single data service. This service could
deliver either telephone (via digitised voice) or data services to your home
or business. In this case, the customer would not be required to make any special configuration changes.</P
><P
>There are a few different ways to connect your computer to an ISDN service.
One way is to use a device called a `Terminal Adaptor' .This adaptor plugs into the
Network Terminating Unit (that you telecommunications carrier will have
installed when you received your ISDN service), and it  presents a number of serial
interfaces. One of those interfaces is used to enter commands. Some commands are used to establish
calls and configuration, while others are actually connected to the network
devices that are to use the data circuits (when they are established). Linux will
work in this sort of configuration without modification: you just treat
the port on the Terminal Adaptor like you would treat any other serial device.
The kernel ISDN support is also designed to allow the user to install an ISDN card into
the Linux machine. This allows the Linux software to handle the protocols, and the software can
make the calls itself.</P

><P
><EM
>PLIP</EM
> (Parallel Line IP) is similar to  SLIP in that it is
used for providing a <EM
>Point-to-Point</EM
> network connection
between two machines.
However, it is designed to use the parallel printer
ports on your machine. It doesn't use the
serial ports (a cabling diagram in
included in the cabling diagram section later in this document). Because it
is possible to transfer more than one bit at a time with a parallel port, it
is possible to attain higher speeds with the <EM
>PLIP</EM
>
interface. PLIP will attain higher speeds than those achieved by using a standard serial device.
In addition, even the simplest of parallel printer ports can be used
(in lieu of you having to purchase comparatively expensive 16550AFN UART's for
your serial ports). PLIP uses a lot of CPU compared to a serial link. It is
not a good option if, for example, you are able to obtain some cheap ethernet cards.
However, it will work when nothing else is available (and will work quite well).
You should expect a data transfer rate of about 20 kilobytes per second (when
a link is running well).</P
><P
>The PLIP device driver competes with the parallel device driver for the
parallel port hardware. If you wish to use both drivers, then you should
compile them both as modules. This ensures that you are able to select which
port you want to use for PLIP, and that you can select which ports you want for the printer driver.
Refer to the ``Modules mini-HOWTO'' for more information on kernel module configuration.</P
><P
>Please note that some laptops use chipsets that will not work with PLIP.
These chipsets do not allow some combinations of signals. PLIP relies on
these signals, but printers don't use them.</P
><P
>The Linux <EM
>PLIP</EM
> interface is compatible with the
<EM
>Crynwyr</EM
> Packet
Driver PLIP/  .This will mean that you can connect your Linux machine
to a DOS machine running any other sort of tcp/ip software via <EM

that is exclusively yours. Each time you connect to the server, you will
configure your SLIP port with that address. The static SLIP server will
answer your modem call, possibly prompt you for a username and password,
and then route any datagrams destined for your address to you via that
connection. If you have a static server, then you may want to put entries
for your hostname and IP address (since you know what it will be) into your

>A <EM

> SLIP server is one which allocates you an IP
address randomly (from a pool of addresses) each time you logon. This
means that there is no guarantee that you will have any particular
address. Address may well be used by someone else
after you have logged off.  The network administrator who configured
the SLIP server will have assigned a pool of address for the SLIP
server to use. When the server receives a new incoming call, the following steps occur: initially, it finds
the first unused address; second, it guides the caller through the login process; finally, it
then prints a welcome message that contains the IP address it has
allocated. It will ultimately use that particular IP address for the duration of
the call.</P
><P
>Configuring for this type of server is similar to configuring for a
static server. You must add an extra step, however, where you obtain the IP
address the server has allocated to you. Then you can configure your SLIP
device with that address.</P
><P
>Again, <EM

enough to not only log you in, but they are also able to automatically

>Appletalk support allows your Linux machine to interwork with Apple networks.
An important use for this is to share resources (such as printers and disks)

A `token' is held by one station. This station is the only one
allowed to transmit. When it has transmitted
its data, it then passes the token onto the next station. The token loops amongst
all active stations; hence the name `Token Ring'.</P

hardware flow control. The following cable provides the best possible signalling

>While you may be able to run PLIP cables for long distances, you should
avoid it if you can. The specifications for the cable allow for a cable
length of about 1 meter or so. Please be very careful when running long
PLIP cables as sources of strong electromagnetic fields (such as lightning,
power lines, and radio transmitters) can interfere with and sometimes even
damage your controller. If you really want to connect two of your computers
over a large distance, then you really should be looking at obtaining a pair of
thin-net ethernet cards (and running some coaxial cable).

>13.3. 10base2 (thin coax) Ethernet Cabling</A
></H2
><P
>10base2 is an ethernet cabling standard that specifies the use of 50 ohm
coaxial cable that has a diameter of about 5 millimeters. There are a couple of
important rules to remember when interconnecting machines with 10base2 cabling.
The first is that you must use terminators at <EM
>both ends</EM
> of the cabling.
A terminator is a 50 ohm resistor that helps to ensure that the signal is
absorbed (and not reflected) when it reaches the end of the cable. Without
a terminator at each end of the cabling, you may find that the ethernet is
unreliable (or doesn't work). Normally you'd use `T pieces' to
interconnect the machines. You would end up with something that looks like this:</P

length of cable between the `T piece' and the actual ethernet card in the
PC as short as possible. The `T piece' will ideally be plugged directly into
the ethernet card.

>Chapter 14. Glossary of Terms used in this document.</H1
><P
>The following is a list of some of the most important terms used in this
document.
<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>ARP</DT
><DD
><P
>This is an acronym for the <EM
>Address Resolution
Protocol</EM
> . It is how a network machine associates an
IP Address with a hardware address.</P
></DD
><DT
>ATM</DT
><DD
><P
>This is an acronym for <EM
>Asynchronous Transfer
Mode</EM
>.  An ATM network packages data into standard size
blocks which it can convey efficiently from point to
point. ATM is a circuit switched packet network technology.</P
></DD
><DT
>Client</DT
><DD
><P
>This is usually the piece of software at the end
of a system where the user is located. There are exceptions.
For example, in the X11 window system, it is actually the
server with the user and the client runs on the remote
machine. The client is the program (or end) of a system that is
receiving the service provided by the server. In the case of
<EM
>peer to peer</EM
> systems such as <EM
>slip</EM
> or <EM
>ppp</EM
>, the
client is taken to be the end that initiates the connection.
The remote end being called is taken to be the server.</P
></DD
><DT
>Datagram</DT
><DD
><P
>A datagram is a discrete package of data and
headers which contain addresses (which is the basic unit of
transmission across an IP network). You might also hear this
called a `packet'.</P
></DD
><DT
>DLCI</DT
><DD
><P
>The DLCI is the Data Link Connection Identifier. It
is used to identify a unique virtual Point-to-Point connection
via a Frame Relay network. The DLCI's are normally assigned by
the Frame Relay network provider.</P
></DD
><DT
>Frame Relay</DT
><DD
><P
>Frame Relay is a network technology ideally
suited to carrying traffic that is of bursty or sporadic in
nature. Network costs are reduced by having many Frame Relay
customer sharing the same network capacity (and relying on them
wanting to make use of the network at slightly different
times).</P
></DD
><DT
>Hardware address</DT
><DD
><P
>This is a number that uniquely
identifies a host in a physical network at the media access
layer. Examples of this are <EM
>Ethernet Addresses</EM
> and
<EM
>AX.25 Addresses</EM
>.</P
></DD
><DT
>ISDN</DT
><DD
><P
>This is an acronym for <EM
>Integrated Services
Digital Network</EM
>. ISDN provides a standardized means by
which Telecommunications companies may deliver either voice or
data information to a customers premises. ISDN is technically
a circuit switched data network.</P
></DD
><DT
>ISP</DT
><DD
><P
>This is an acronym for an Internet Service
Provider. These are organizations or companies that provide
people with network connectivity to the Internet.</P
></DD
><DT
>IP address</DT
><DD
><P
>This is a number that uniquely identifies a
TCP/IP host on the network. The address is 4 bytes long and is
usually represented in what is called the "dotted decimal
notation" (where each byte is represented in decimal from with
dots `.' between them).</P
></DD
><DT
>MSS</DT
><DD
><P
>The Maximum Segment Size (<EM
>MSS</EM
>) is the
largest quantity of data that can be transmitted at one
time. If you want to prevent local fragmentation, MSS would
equal MTU-IP header.</P
></DD
><DT
>MTU</DT
><DD
><P
>The Maximum Transmission Unit (<EM
>MTU</EM
>) is a
parameter that determines the largest datagram than can be
transmitted by an IP interface (without it needing to be broken
down into smaller units). The MTU should be larger than the
largest datagram you wish to transmit unfragmented. Note: this
only prevents fragmentation locally. Some other link in the
path may have a smaller MTU: the datagram will be
fragmented at that point. Typical values are 1500 bytes for an
ethernet interface, or 576 bytes for a SLIP interface.</P
></DD
><DT
>Route</DT
><DD
><P
>The <EM
>route</EM
> is the path that your datagrams
take through the network to reach their destination.</P
></DD
><DT
>Server</DT
><DD
><P
>This is usually the piece of software or end of a
system remote from the user. The server provides some service
to one or many clients.  Examples of servers include <EM
>ftp</EM
>,
<EM
>Networked File System</EM
>, or <EM
>Domain Name Server</EM
>. In the
case of <EM
>peer to peer</EM
> systems (such as <EM
>slip</EM
> or
<EM
>ppp</EM
> ), the server is taken to be the end of the link that is
called. The end calling is taken to be the client.</P
></DD
><DT
>Window</DT
><DD
><P
>The <EM
>window</EM
> is the largest amount of data
that the receiving end can accept at a given point in time.</P
