><EM
>PLIP</EM
> (Parallel Line IP) is similar to  SLIP in that it is
used for providing a <EM
>Point-to-Point</EM
> network connection
between two machines.
However, it is designed to use the parallel printer
ports on your machine. It doesn't use the
serial ports (a cabling diagram in
included in the cabling diagram section later in this document). Because it
is possible to transfer more than one bit at a time with a parallel port, it
is possible to attain higher speeds with the <EM
>PLIP</EM
>
interface. PLIP will attain higher speeds than those achieved by using a standard serial device.
In addition, even the simplest of parallel printer ports can be used
(in lieu of you having to purchase comparatively expensive 16550AFN UART's for
your serial ports). PLIP uses a lot of CPU compared to a serial link. It is
not a good option if, for example, you are able to obtain some cheap ethernet cards.
However, it will work when nothing else is available (and will work quite well).
You should expect a data transfer rate of about 20 kilobytes per second (when
a link is running well).</P
><P
>The PLIP device driver competes with the parallel device driver for the
parallel port hardware. If you wish to use both drivers, then you should
compile them both as modules. This ensures that you are able to select which
port you want to use for PLIP, and that you can select which ports you want for the printer driver.
Refer to the ``Modules mini-HOWTO'' for more information on kernel module configuration.</P
><P
>Please note that some laptops use chipsets that will not work with PLIP.
These chipsets do not allow some combinations of signals. PLIP relies on
these signals, but printers don't use them.</P
><P
>The Linux <EM
>PLIP</EM
> interface is compatible with the
<EM
>Crynwyr</EM
> Packet
Driver PLIP/  .This will mean that you can connect your Linux machine
to a DOS machine running any other sort of tcp/ip software via <EM
>PLIIP</EM
>.
 </P
><P
>In the 2.0.* series kernel, the PLIP devices are mapped to i/o port and IRQ as
follows:</P

>If your parallel ports don't match any of the above combinations, then you
can change the IRQ of a port. Change the IRQ by using the <EM
>ifconfig</EM
> command with the
`<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>irq</TT
>' parameter (be sure to enable IRQ's on your printer ports in your
ROM BIOS if it supports this option). As an alternative, you
can specify ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>io=</TT
>'' and ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>irq=</TT
>'' options on the
<EM
>insmod</EM

>PLIP operation is controlled by two timeouts: their default values
are probably ok in most cases. You will more than likely need to increase them
if you have an especially slow computer. In this case the timers to
increase are actually on the <EM
>other</EM
> computer.  A program called
<EM
>plipconfig</EM
> exists that allows you to change these timer settings
without recompiling your kernel. This program is supplied with many Linux
distributions.</P

>To configure a <EM

the following commands (or <EM

>The ``first'' PLIP device is always called ``plip0'' (where first
is the first device detected by the system; similarly to what happens
for Ethernet devices). The actual parallel port being used is one of
the available ports, as shown in <TT

if you have only one parallel port, you'll only have a directory
