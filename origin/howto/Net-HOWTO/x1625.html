>The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a series of standards
that specify a general purpose switched digital data network. An ISDN `call'
creates a synchronous Point-to-Point data service to the destination. ISDN
is generally delivered on a high speed link that is broken down into a number
of discrete channels. There are two different types of channels, the
`B Channels' (which will actually carry the user data) and a single channel
called the `D channel' (which is used to send control information to the ISDN
exchange: used for establishing calls and other functions). In Australia, for example,
ISDN may be delivered on a 2Mbps link that is broken into 30 discrete 64kbps
B channels (with one 64kbps D channel). Any number of channels may be used at a
time, and these channels can be used in any combination. You could, for example, establish 30 separate calls
to 30 different destinations at 64kbps each. You could also establish 15 calls
to 15 different destinations at 128kbps each (two channels used per call).
Finally, you could establish just a small number of calls while leaving the rest idle. A channel may be used
for either incoming or outgoing calls. The original intention of ISDN was to
allow Telecommunications companies to provide a single data service. This service could
deliver either telephone (via digitised voice) or data services to your home
or business. In this case, the customer would not be required to make any special configuration changes.</P
><P
>There are a few different ways to connect your computer to an ISDN service.
One way is to use a device called a `Terminal Adaptor' .This adaptor plugs into the
Network Terminating Unit (that you telecommunications carrier will have
installed when you received your ISDN service), and it  presents a number of serial
interfaces. One of those interfaces is used to enter commands. Some commands are used to establish
calls and configuration, while others are actually connected to the network
devices that are to use the data circuits (when they are established). Linux will
work in this sort of configuration without modification: you just treat
the port on the Terminal Adaptor like you would treat any other serial device.
The kernel ISDN support is also designed to allow the user to install an ISDN card into
the Linux machine. This allows the Linux software to handle the protocols, and the software can
make the calls itself.</P

>A note about PPP</EM
>. The PPP suite of protocols will operate over
either asynchronous or synchronous serial lines. The commonly distributed
PPP daemon for Linux `<EM
>pppd</EM
>' supports only asynchronous mode. If you wish
to run the PPP protocols over your ISDN service, you need a specially modified
version. Details of where to find this version are available in the documentation
referred to above.
