    Understanding TCP keepalive is not necessary in most cases, but it's a
    subject that can be very useful under particular circumstances. You will
    need to know basic TCP/IP networking concepts, and the C programming
    language to understand all sections of this document.
  </p><p>
    The main purpose of this HOWTO is to describe TCP keepalive in detail and
    demonstrate various application situations. After some initial theory, the
    discussion focuses on the Linux implementation of TCP keepalive routines in
    the modern Linux kernel releases (2.4.x, 2.6.x), and how system
    administrators can take advantage of these routines, with specific
    configuration examples and tricks.
  </p><p>
    The second part of the HOWTO involves the programming interface exposed by
    the Linux kernel, and how to write TCP keepalive-enabled applications in the
    C language. Pratical examples are presented, and there is an introduction to
    the <code class="literal">libkeepalive</code> project, which permits legacy
    applications to benefit from keepalive with no code modification.
