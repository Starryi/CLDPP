The first layer of security you need to take into account is the
physical security of your computer systems. Who has direct physical
access to your machine? Should they? Can you protect your machine from
their tampering? Should you? 
</p><p>
How much physical security you need on your system is very dependent
on your situation, and/or budget. 
</p><p>
If you are a home user, you probably don't need a lot (although you
might need to protect your machine from tampering by children or
annoying relatives).  If you are in a lab, you need
considerably more, but users will still need to be able to get work
done on the machines. Many of the following sections will help out. If
you are in an office, you may or may not need to secure your machine
off-hours or while you are away. At some companies, leaving your
console unsecured is a termination offense. 
</p><p>
Obvious physical security methods such as locks on doors, cables,
locked cabinets, and video surveillance are all good ideas, but beyond
the scope of this document. :)
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm190"></a>3.1. Computer locks</h3></div></div></div><p>
Many modern PC cases include a "locking" feature. Usually this
will be a socket on the front of the case that allows you to turn an
included key to a locked or unlocked position. Case locks can help
prevent someone from stealing your PC, or opening up the case and
directly manipulating/stealing your hardware. They can also sometimes
prevent someone from rebooting your computer from their own floppy or
other hardware. 
</p><p>
These case locks do different things according to the support in the
motherboard and how the case is constructed. On many PC's they make it
so you have to break the case to get the case open. On some others,
they will not let you plug in new keyboards or
mice. Check your motherboard or case instructions for more
information. This can sometimes be a very useful feature, even though
the locks are usually very low-quality and can easily be defeated by
attackers with locksmithing. 
</p><p>
Some machines (most notably SPARC's and macs) have a dongle on the back
that, if you put a cable through, attackers would have to cut the cable
or break the case to get into it. Just putting a padlock or combo lock
through these can be a good deterrent to someone stealing your
machine.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm195"></a>3.2. BIOS Security</h3></div></div></div><p>
The BIOS is the lowest level of software that configures or
manipulates your x86-based hardware. LILO and other Linux boot methods
access the BIOS to determine how to boot up your Linux machine. Other
hardware that Linux runs on has similar software (Open Firmware on Macs
and new Suns, Sun boot PROM, etc...). You can use your BIOS to prevent 
attackers from rebooting your machine and manipulating your Linux
system. 
</p><p>
Many PC BIOSs let you set a boot password. This
doesn't provide all that much security (the BIOS can be reset, or removed
if someone can get into the case), but might be a good deterrent (i.e. it
will take time and leave traces of tampering). Similarly, on
S/Linux (Linux for SPARC(tm) processor machines), your EEPROM
can be set to require a boot-up password. This might slow attackers down.  
</p><p>
Another risk of trusting BIOS passwords to secure your system is the
default password problem. Most BIOS makers don't expect people to
open up their computer and disconnect batteries if they forget their
password and have equipped their BIOSes with default passwords that
work regardless of your chosen password. Some of the more common
passwords include:
</p><p>
j262
AWARD_SW
AWARD_PW
lkwpeter
Biostar
AMI
Award
bios
BIOS
setup
cmos
AMI!SW1
AMI?SW1
password
hewittrand
shift + s y x z
</p><p>
I tested an Award BIOS and AWARD_PW worked. These passwords are quite
easily available from manufacturers' websites and
<a class="ulink" href="http://astalavista.box.sk" target="_top">http://astalavista.box.sk</a> 
and as such a BIOS password cannot be considered adequate protection
from a knowledgeable attacker. 
</p><p>
Many x86 BIOSs also allow you to specify various other good security
settings. Check your BIOS manual or look at it the next time you boot
up. For example, some BIOSs disallow booting from floppy drives and some
require passwords to access some BIOS features. 
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Note</em></span>: If you have a server machine, and you set up a boot password,
your machine will not boot up unattended. Keep in mind that you will
need to come in and supply the password in the event of a power
failure. ;(
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm206"></a>3.3. Boot Loader Security</h3></div></div></div><p>
The various Linux boot loaders also can have a boot password set.
LILO, for example, has <code class="literal">password</code> and <code class="literal">restricted</code>
settings; <code class="literal">password</code> requires password at boot time,
whereas <code class="literal">restricted</code> requires a boot-time password only if you
specify options (such as <code class="literal">single</code>) at the <code class="literal">LILO </code> prompt.
</p><p>
&gt;From the lilo.conf man page: 

</p><pre class="screen">
password=password
              The per-image option `password=...' (see below) applies to all images.

restricted
              The per-image option `restricted' (see below) applies to all images.

       password=password
              Protect the image by a password.

       restricted
              A password is only required to boot the image if
              parameters are specified  on  the  command  line 
              (e.g. single).
</pre><p>

</p><p>
Keep in mind when setting all these passwords that you need to
remember them. :) Also remember that these passwords will merely slow
the determined attacker.  They won't prevent someone from booting from 
a floppy, and mounting your root partition.  If you are using security 
in conjunction with a boot loader, you might as well disable booting
from a floppy in your computer's BIOS, and password-protect the BIOS.
</p><p>
Also keep in mind that the /etc/lilo.conf will need to be mode "600"
(readable and writing for root only), or others will be able to read
your passwords!
</p><p>
&gt;From the GRUB info page:  
GRUB provides "password" feature, so that only administrators
    can start the interactive operations (i.e. editing menu entries and
    entering the command-line interface). To use this feature, you need to
    run the command `password' in your configuration file (*note
    password::), like this:
</p><p>
	 password --md5 PASSWORD
</p><p>
       If this is specified, GRUB disallows any interactive control, until
    you press the key &lt;p&gt; and enter a correct password.  The option `--md5'
    tells GRUB that `PASSWORD' is in MD5 format.  If it is omitted, GRUB
    assumes the `PASSWORD' is in clear text.
</p><p>
       You can encrypt your password with the command `md5crypt' (*note
    md5crypt::). For example, run the grub shell (*note Invoking the grub
    shell::), and enter your password:
</p><p>
	 grub&gt; md5crypt
	 Password: **********
	 Encrypted: $1$U$JK7xFegdxWH6VuppCUSIb.
</p><p>
       Then, cut and paste the encrypted password to your configuration
    file.
</p><p>
Grub also has a 'lock' command that will allow you to lock a partition
if you don't provide the correct password. Simply add 'lock' and the
partition will not be accessable until the user supplies a password. 
</p><p>
If anyone has security-related information from a different boot
loader, we would love to hear it. (<code class="literal">grub</code>, <code class="literal">silo</code>, <code class="literal">milo</code>, <code class="literal">linload</code>, etc). 
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Note</em></span>: If you have a server machine, and you set up a boot password,
your machine will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> boot up unattended. Keep in mind that you will
need to come in and supply the password in the event of a power
failure. ;(
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm234"></a>3.4. xlock and vlock</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you wander away from your machine from time to time, it is nice to
be able to "lock" your console so that no one can tamper with, or look at,
your work. Two programs that do this are: <code class="literal">xlock</code> and <code class="literal">vlock</code>. 
</p><p>
<code class="literal">xlock</code> is a X display locker. It should be included in any Linux
distributions that support X. Check out the man page for it for more
options, but in general you can run <code class="literal">xlock</code> from any xterm on your
console and it will lock the display and require your password to
unlock. 
</p><p>
<code class="literal">vlock</code> is a simple little program that allows you to lock some or all
of the virtual consoles on your Linux box. You can lock just the one
you are working in or all of them. If you just lock one, others can
come in and use the console; they will just not be able to use your
virtual console until you unlock it. <code class="literal">vlock</code> ships with RedHat
Linux, but your mileage may vary. 
</p><p>
Of course locking your console will prevent someone from tampering
with your work, but won't prevent them from rebooting your machine
or otherwise disrupting your work. It also does not prevent them from
accessing your machine from another machine on the network and causing 
problems.
</p><p>
More importantly, it does not prevent someone from switching out of
the X Window System entirely, and going to a normal virtual console
login prompt, or to the VC that X11 was started from, and suspending
it, thus obtaining your privileges.  For this reason, you might
consider only using it while under control of xdm.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm247"></a>3.5. Security of local devices</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you have a webcam or a microphone attached to your system, you
should consider if there is some danger of a attacker gaining access
to those devices. When not in use, unplugging or removing such devices
might be an option. Otherwise you should carefully read and look at
any software with provides access to such devices. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm250"></a>3.6. Detecting Physical Security Compromises</h3></div></div></div><p>
The first thing to always note is when your machine was
rebooted. Since Linux is a robust and stable OS, the only times your
machine should reboot is when <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> take it down for OS upgrades,
hardware swapping, or the like. If your machine has rebooted without
you doing it, that may be a sign that an intruder has compromised
it. Many of the ways that your machine can be compromised require the
intruder to reboot or power off your machine. 
</p><p>
Check for signs of tampering on the case and computer area. Although
many intruders clean traces of their presence out of logs, it's a good
idea to check through them all and note any discrepancy.
</p><p>
It is also a good idea to store log data at a secure location, such as 
a dedicated log server within your well-protected network.  Once a
machine has been compromised, log data becomes of little use as it
most likely has also been modified by the intruder.
</p><p>
The syslog daemon can be configured to automatically send log data to
a central syslog server, but this is typically sent unencrypted, 
allowing an intruder to view data as it is being transferred.  This
may reveal information about your network that is not intended to be
public.  There are syslog daemons available that encrypt the data as
it is being sent. 
</p><p>
Also be aware that faking syslog messages is easy -- with an exploit
program having been published.  Syslog even accepts net log entries
claiming to come from the local host without indicating their true origin.
</p><p>
Some things to check for in your logs:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
Short or incomplete logs.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Logs containing strange timestamps.

Logs with incorrect permissions or ownership.

Records of reboots or restarting of services. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
missing logs. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<code class="literal">su</code> entries or logins from strange places.
