A few minutes of preparation and planning ahead before putting your
systems on-line can help to protect them and the data
stored on them.

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
There should never be a reason for users' home directories to allow
SUID/SGID programs to be run from there.  Use the <code class="literal">nosuid</code> option in
<code class="literal">/etc/fstab</code> for partitions that are writable by others than root.  You
may also wish to use <code class="literal">nodev</code> and <code class="literal">noexec</code> on users' home partitions,
as well as <code class="literal">/var</code>, thus prohibiting execution of programs, and
creation of character or block devices, which should never be
necessary anyway. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If you are exporting file-systems using NFS, be sure to configure
<code class="literal">/etc/exports</code> with the most restrictive access possible.  This means
not using wild cards, not allowing root write access, and exporting
read-only wherever possible.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Configure your users' file-creation <code class="literal">umask</code> to be as restrictive as
possible.  See <a class="xref" href="ar01s05.html#umask" title="5.1. Umask Settings">Section 5.1, &#8220;Umask Settings&#8221;</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
If you are mounting file systems using a network file system such as
NFS, be sure to configure /etc/exports with suitable restrictions.
Typically, using `nodev', `nosuid', and perhaps `noexec', are
desirable.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Set file system limits instead of allowing <code class="literal">unlimited</code> as is the
default.  You can control the per-user limits using the
resource-limits PAM module and <code class="literal">/etc/pam.d/limits.conf</code>.  For example,
limits for group <code class="literal">users</code> might look like this:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="screen">
		@users     hard  core    0
		@users     hard  nproc   50
		@users     hard  rss     5000
</pre><p>

</p><p>
This says to prohibit the creation of core files, restrict the
number of processes to 50, and restrict memory usage per user to
5M.
</p><p>
You can also use the /etc/login.defs configuration file to set the
same limits. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The <code class="literal">/var/log/wtmp</code> and <code class="literal">/var/run/utmp</code> files contain the login records
for all users on your system.  Their integrity must be maintained
because they can be used to determine when and from where a user (or
potential intruder) has entered your system.  These files should
also have <code class="literal">644</code> permissions, without affecting normal system
operation.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The immutable bit can be used to prevent accidentally deleting or
overwriting a file that must be protected.  It also prevents someone
from creating a hard link to the file. See the <code class="literal">chattr</code>(1)
man page for information on the immutable bit. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

SUID and SGID files on your system are a potential security risk, and
should be monitored closely.  Because these programs grant special
privileges to the user who is executing them, it is necessary to
ensure that insecure programs are not installed.  A favorite trick of
crackers is to exploit SUID-root programs, then leave a SUID
program as a back door to get in the next time, even if the original
hole is plugged.
</p><p>
Find all SUID/SGID programs on your system, and keep track of what
they are, so you are aware of any changes which could indicate a
potential intruder.  Use the following command to find all SUID/SGID
programs on your system:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="screen">
                root#  find / -type f \( -perm -04000 -o -perm -02000 \)
</pre><p>

</p><p>
The Debian distribution runs a job each night to determine what SUID
files exist. It then compares this to the previous night's run. You can 
look in <code class="literal">/var/log/setuid*</code> for this log.
</p><p>
You can remove the SUID or SGID permissions on a
suspicious program with <code class="literal">chmod</code>, then restore them back if you
absolutely feel it is necessary.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
World-writable files, particularly system files, can be a security
hole if a cracker gains access to your system and modifies them.
Additionally, world-writable directories are dangerous, since they
allow a cracker to add or delete files as he wishes.  To locate all
world-writable files on your system, use the following command:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="screen">
		root# find / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls
</pre><p>

and be sure you know why those files are writable.  In the normal
course of operation, several files will be world-writable, including some
from <code class="literal">/dev</code>, and symbolic links, thus the <code class="literal">! -type l</code>
which excludes these from the previous <code class="literal">find</code> command.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
</p><p>
Unowned files may also be an indication an intruder has accessed your
system.  You can locate files on your system that have no
owner, or belong to no group with the command:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="screen">
		root# find / \( -nouser -o -nogroup \) -print
</pre><p>

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Finding <code class="literal">.rhosts</code> files should be a part of your regular system
administration duties, as these files should not be permitted on your
system.  Remember, a cracker only needs one insecure account to
potentially gain access to your entire network.  You can locate all
<code class="literal">.rhosts</code> files on your system with the following command:

</p><pre class="screen">
               root# find /home -name .rhosts -print
</pre><p>

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
</p><p>
Finally, before changing permissions on any system files, make sure
you understand what you are doing. Never change permissions on a file
because it seems like the easy way to get things working. Always
determine why the file has that permission before changing it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="umask"></a>5.1. Umask Settings</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <code class="literal">umask</code> command can be used to determine the default file creation
mode on your system. It is the octal complement of the desired file
mode. If files are created without any regard to their permissions
settings, the user could inadvertently give read or write permission
to someone that should not have this permission. Typical <code class="literal">umask</code>
settings include <code class="literal">022</code>, <code class="literal">027</code>, and <code class="literal">077</code> (which is the most
restrictive). Normally the umask is set in <code class="literal">/etc/profile</code>, so it applies
to all users on the system.  The resulting permission is calculated as
follows: The default permission of  user/group/others (7 for
directories, 6 for files) is combined with the  inverted mask (NOT)
using AND on a per-bit-basis. 
</p><p>
Example 1:
</p><p>
file, default 6, binary:      110
mask, eg. 2: 010, NOT:        101
</p><p>
resulting permission, AND:    100  (equals 4, r__)
</p><p>
Example 2:
</p><p>
file, default 6, binary:      110
mask, eg. 6: 110, NOT:        001
</p><p>
resulting permission, AND:    000  (equals 0, ___)
</p><p>
Example 3:
</p><p>
directory, default 7, binary: 111                
mask, eg. 2: 010, NOT:        101 
</p><p>
resulting permission, AND:    101  (equals 5, r_x)
</p><p>
Example 4:
</p><p>
directory, default 7, binary: 111                
mask, eg. 6: 110, NOT:        001 
</p><p>
resulting permission, AND:    001  (equals 1, __x)
</p><p>

</p><pre class="screen">
		# Set the user's default umask
		umask 033
</pre><p>

Be sure to make root's umask <code class="literal">077</code>, which will disable read, write, and
execute permission for other users, unless explicitly changed using
<code class="literal">chmod</code>.  In this case, newly-created directories would have 744
permissions, obtained by subtracting 033 from 777.  Newly-created files
using the 033 umask would have permissions of 644.
</p><p>
If you are using Red Hat, and adhere to their user and group ID
creation scheme (User Private Groups), it is only necessary to use <code class="literal">002</code>
for a <code class="literal">umask</code>.  This is due to the fact that the default configuration
is one user per group.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm432"></a>5.2. File Permissions</h3></div></div></div><p>
It's important to ensure that your system files are not open for
casual editing by users and groups who shouldn't be doing such system
maintenance.
</p><p>
Unix separates access control on files and directories according to
three characteristics:  owner, group, and other.  There is always
exactly one owner, any number of members of the group, and everyone
else.
</p><p>
A quick explanation of Unix permissions:
</p><p>
Ownership      - Which user(s) and group(s) retain(s) control of the
permission settings of the node and parent of the node
</p><p>
Permissions    - Bits capable of being set or reset to allow certain
types of access to it.  Permissions for directories may have a
different meaning than the same set of permissions on files.

The "sticky bit" also has a different meaning when 
applied to directories than when applied to files.  If the sticky bit is set on a directory, then 
a user may only delete files that the he owns or for which he has
explicit write permission granted, even when he has write access to
the directory.  This is designed for directories like <code class="literal">/tmp</code>, which are
world-writable, but where it may not be desirable to allow any user to 
delete files at will.  The sticky bit is seen as a <code class="literal">t</code> in a long
directory listing.
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">SUID Attribute: (For Files)</span></dt><dd><p>
This describes set-user-id permissions on the file.  When the set user
ID access mode is set in the owner permissions, and the file is
executable, processes which run it are granted access to system
resources based on user who owns the file, as opposed to the user who
created the process. This is the cause of many "buffer overflow" exploits.
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">SGID Attribute: (For Files)</span></dt><dd><p>
If set in the group permissions, this bit controls the "set group id" 
status of a file.  This behaves the same way as SUID, except the group 
is affected instead.  The file must be executable for this to
have any effect.
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">SGID Attribute: (For directories)</span></dt><dd><p>
If you set the SGID bit on a directory (with <code class="literal">chmod g+s directory</code>),

The following lines are examples of the minimum sets of permissions

</p><p>

</p><pre class="screen">

System configuration files (usually in <code class="literal">/etc</code>) are usually mode <code class="literal">640</code>
(<code class="literal">-rw-r-----</code>), and owned by root. Depending on your site's security
requirements, you might adjust this. Never leave any system files
writable by a group or everyone.  Some configuration files, including
<code class="literal">/etc/shadow</code>, should only be readable by root, and directories in <code class="literal">/etc</code>
should at least not be accessible by others.

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm513"></a>5.3. Integrity Checking</h3></div></div></div><p>
Another very good way to detect local (and also network) attacks on
your system is to run an integrity checker like <code class="literal">Tripwire</code>,
<code class="literal">Aide</code> or <code class="literal">Osiris</code>.
These integrety checkers run a number of checksums on all your important
binaries and config files and compares them against a database of former,
known-good values as a reference. Thus, any changes in the files will 
be flagged.
</p><p>
It's a good idea to install these sorts of programs onto a floppy, and then
physically set the write protect on the floppy. This way intruders
can't tamper with the integrety checker itself or change the database. Once you
have something like this setup, it's a good idea to run it as part of your normal
security administration duties to see if anything has changed.
</p><p>
You can even add a <code class="literal">crontab</code> entry to run the checker from your floppy
every night and mail you the results in the morning. Something like:

</p><pre class="screen">
		# set mailto
		MAILTO=kevin
		# run Tripwire
		15 05 * * * root /usr/local/adm/tcheck/tripwire 
</pre><p>

will mail you a report each morning at 5:15am. 
</p><p>
Integrity checkers can be a godsend to detecting intruders before you would
otherwise notice them. Since a lot of files change on the average
system, you have to be careful what is cracker activity and what is
your own doing. 
</p><p>
You can find the freely available unsusported version of
<code class="literal">Tripwire</code> at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tripwire.org" target="_top">http://www.tripwire.org</a>, 
free of charge.  Manuals and support can be purchased.
</p><p>
<code class="literal">Aide</code> can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html" target="_top">http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html</a>. 
</p><p>
<code class="literal">Osiris</code> can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.shmoo.com/osiris/" target="_top">http://www.shmoo.com/osiris/</a>.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm533"></a>5.4. Trojan Horses</h3></div></div></div><p>
"Trojan Horses" are named after the fabled ploy in Virgil's  "Aenid".
The idea is that a cracker distributes a program or binary that sounds
great, and encourages other people to download it and run it as root. Then
the program can compromise their system while they are not paying
attention. While they think the binary they just pulled down does one
thing (and it might very well), it also compromises their security. 
</p><p>
You should take care of what programs you install on your
machine. RedHat provides MD5 checksums and PGP signatures on its RPM 
files so you can verify you are installing the real thing. Other 
distributions have similar methods. You should never run any unfamiliar 
binary, for which you don't have the source, as root. Few attackers are 
willing to release source code to public scrutiny.
</p><p>
Although it can be complex, make sure you are getting the source for
a program from its real distribution site. If the program is going to
run as root, make sure either you or someone you trust has looked over
the source and verified it.
