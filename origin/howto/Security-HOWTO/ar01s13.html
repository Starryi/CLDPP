 Is it more secure to compile driver support directly into the
kernel, instead of making it a module?
</p><p>
Answer: Some people think it is better to disable the ability to load
device drivers using modules, because an intruder could load a Trojan
module or a module that could affect system security.
</p><p>
However, in order to load modules, you must be root.  The module
object files are also only writable by root.  This means the intruder
would need root access to insert a module.  If the intruder gains root
access, there are more serious things to worry about than whether he
will load a module.
</p><p>
Modules are for dynamically loading support for a particular device
that may be infrequently used.  On server machines, or firewalls for
instance, this is very unlikely to happen.  For this reason, it would
make more sense to compile support directly into the kernel for
machines acting as a server.  Modules are also slower than support
compiled directly in the kernel.

 Why does logging in as root from a remote machine always fail?
</p><p>
Answer: See <a class="xref" href="ar01s04.html#root-security" title="4.2. Root Security">Section 4.2, &#8220;Root Security&#8221;</a>.  This is done
intentionally to prevent remote users from attempting to connect via
<code class="literal">telnet</code> to your machine as <code class="literal">root</code>, which is a serious
security
vulnerability, because then the root password would be transmitted, in
clear text, across the network.  Don't forget: potential intruders have time on their
side, and can run automated programs to find your
password. Additionally, this is done to keep a clear record of who
logged in, not just root.

 How do I enable shadow passwords on my Linux box?
</p><p>
Answer:
</p><p>
To enable shadow passwords, run <code class="literal">pwconv</code> as root, and
<code class="literal">/etc/shadow</code> should now exist, and be used by applications.
If you are using RH 4.2 or above, the PAM modules will automatically
adapt to the change from using normal <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code> to shadow
passwords without any other change.
</p><p>
Some background: shadow passwords is a mechanism for storing your
password in a file other than the normal <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code> file.  This has
several advantages.  The first one is that the shadow file,
<code class="literal">/etc/shadow</code>, is only readable by root, unlike <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code>,
which must remain readable by everyone.  The other advantage is that as the
administrator, you can enable or disable accounts without everyone
knowing the status of other users' accounts.
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code> file is then used to store user and group names, used
by programs like <code class="literal">/bin/ls</code> to map the user ID to the proper user name
in a directory listing.
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">/etc/shadow</code> file then only contains the user name and his/her
password, and perhaps accounting information, like when the account
expires, etc.
</p><p>
To enable shadow passwords, run <code class="literal">pwconv</code> as root, and
<code class="literal">/etc/shadow</code> should now exist, and be used by applications.
Since you are using RH 4.2 or above, the PAM modules will automatically
adapt to the change from using normal <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code> to shadow
passwords without any other change.
</p><p>
Since you're interested in securing your passwords, perhaps you would
also be interested in generating good passwords to begin with.  For
this you can use the <code class="literal">pam_cracklib</code> module, which is part of PAM.  It
runs your password against the Crack libraries to help you decide if
it is too-easily guessable by password-cracking programs.

 How can I manipulate user accounts, and still retain security?
</p><p>
Answer:  most distributions contain a great number of tools to change
the properties of user accounts.

The <code class="literal">pwconv</code> and <code class="literal">unpwconv</code> programs can be used to convert 
between shadow and non-shadowed passwords.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The <code class="literal">pwck</code> and <code class="literal">grpck</code> programs can be used to verify proper
organization of the <code class="literal">passwd</code> and <code class="literal">group</code> files.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The <code class="literal">useradd</code>, <code class="literal">usermod</code>, and <code class="literal">userdel</code> programs can be used to
add, delete and modify user accounts.  The <code class="literal">groupadd</code>,
<code class="literal">groupmod</code>, and <code class="literal">groupdel</code> programs will do the same for groups.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Group passwords can be created using <code class="literal">gpasswd</code>.

</p><p>
All these programs are "shadow-aware" -- that is, if you enable shadow
they will use <code class="literal">/etc/shadow</code> for password information, otherwise they won't.
