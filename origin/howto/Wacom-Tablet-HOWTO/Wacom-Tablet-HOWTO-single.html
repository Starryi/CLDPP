<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765693"></A> </P>
<P>Graphic tablets are now quite inexpensive and can help allot with the work of
image manipulation. In addition to that what a mouse can do for you they have
the following features:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>pressure and tilt sensitivity</LI>
<LI>high resolution motion control</LI>
<LI>sub-pixel positioning</LI>
<LI>an input device that looks like and is handled like a normal Pen.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>This document addresses mainly the products from Wacom, because I own 3
different products of them and because their products are highly available in
the region of Europe.</P>
<P>Nevertheless I think it should be easy to adapt the shown concepts to other
products.</P>

<P>I have written this document because I have not found a document about this
subject which contained completely what I wanted to know.
So I got small parts of information from various people in the
net and assembled them to this HOWTO. Regarding the questions of
my readers, I must realize that this document also is not complete and never
will be. But from the same questions I can tell that it helped many people on
the way, and each new question lets this HOWTO grow.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765698"></A> 
First of all, you should have a tablet, of course. 
The following Wacom tablets are supported:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>ArtZ II series (known in Europe as the UltraPad series -
the same UltraPad name also was used for earlier tablets that only work
partially.)</LI>
<LI>ArtPad II</LI>
<LI>PL300 (combined LCD screen and tablet)</LI>
<LI>Pen Partner</LI>
<LI>Graphire alias FAVO (mouse and pen, get at least the alpha 16 driver for full
support from 
<A HREF="http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~flepied/projects/wacom/">http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~flepied/projects/wacom/</A>).</LI>
<LI> Intuos series (support may be only partial with the driver of your
distribution, get  updated alpha versions from  
<A NAME="_driverlepied"></A> 
Frederic Lepied's page:
<A HREF="http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~flepied/projects/wacom/">http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~flepied/projects/wacom/</A>)</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The older SD and HD series are not supported by the standard XFree86 driver,
however, a modified driver that supports these devices as well some OEM
products with embedded screens including the IBM Thinkpad 360 PE and Toshiba
T200 is available from:
<A HREF="http://hwr.nici.kun.nl/pen-computing/pen-computing-formats.html">http://hwr.nici.kun.nl/pen-computing/pen-computing-formats.html</A></P>

<P><B>USB-Devices</B><BR>
If ordering the wacom products intuos and graphire, you can choose between 
two different interfaces:<BR>
Serial and USB.</P>
<P><EM>The Serial Interface</EM><BR>
<UL>
<LI>is available for a long time, so the drivers are more stable for it</LI>
<LI>can not supply power to the tablet. For graphire and small intuos, wacom 
made an interface wire that plugs between the ps/2 keyboard and the computer to grap that power. Bigger intuos tablets may use an AC-adapter.</LI>
<LI>does not require you to recompile the kernel or to load kernel modules.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><EM>The USB Interface</EM><BR>
<UL>
<LI>is newer, so the drivers may be still in development.</LI>
<LI>can supply power to the tablet, bigger intuos tablets nevertheless may use an AC-adapter.</LI>
<LI>may require you to recompile the kernel and / or to load kernel modules
The section 
<A HREF="#_Tocusbprepare">extra configuration steps</A> later in this document tries to guide you through this process.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>For the linux console, the only program I know is gpm.

</LI>
<LI>For XFree, the keyword is XInput. This specification has to be supported by
device drivers which provide extra information. In turn, XInput has to be
understood by programs which want to use alternative pointer devices.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>There is a big number of programs based on the gtk library. The gtk has XInput
support and makes it very easy to use.<BR>
At least the following applications support XInput:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Gimp - a powerful image manipulation program in the style of Photoshop. The
1.1.x instable development version includes XInput support as a standard
feature. We are awaiting the next stable release, Version 1.2.x.

<A NAME="_gimp"></A> 
Obtain Gimp from
<A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">http://www.gimp.org</A>
, it really deserves it !
I am sure most of you know this and it was the reason to buy a tablet.


</LI>
<LI>gsumi - a simple B/W drawing program that supports drawing / erasing with
pressure and tilt sensitivity.
Get it from the gsumi web page:
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/~otaylor/gsumi/">http://www.gtk.org/~otaylor/gsumi/</A>

<P>USB-Support is done in the kernel. This means that you should be able to configure and recompile the kernel.
If you do not know how, consult your local guru.</P>

<P><B>The Kernel</B><BR></P>
<P>Make sure in the USB Support section of the kernel configuration you have the following set: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     --- USB Human Interface Devices (HID)
     &lt;M>   USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support                     
     ...
     &lt;M>   Wacom Intuos/Graphire tablet support                              
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now recompile the kernel, either load the wacom module (which would be in /lib/modules/&lt;linux version&gt;/kernel/drivers/usb/wacom.o), or reboot, and verify that the module was loaded: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     # grep -i wacom /var/log/boot.msg
     input0: Wacom Intuos 9x12 on usb1:2.0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

On some system you may want to grep in /var/log/messages instead.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B><BR>
At least for the intuos series 
even the latest kernel (2.4.7 as of moment of writing) doesn't have the right Wacom USB driver, so you have to get the right one and recompile the stuff. See 
<A HREF="http://www.best.com/~sem/linux/wacom/">Semyon Sosin 's document</A> for this. </P>
<P>I can not tell if wacom graphire works fine with the original driver. But take 
for sure that the shown __concepts__ will work for both wacom product lines.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Tablets and gpm</A>
</H2>


<P>
<A NAME="_Toc46576570a"></A> 
The 
<A HREF="#_gpm">gpm</A>
daemon supports allot of input devices, including tablets. If you want
a list of the supported devices of your gpm, do a
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>gpm -t help</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and you get it.</P>
<P>The Wacom driver of gpm 1.18.0 and below seems to be for the very old
artpad models, the documentation does not say anything about this. I
tested it with ultrapad, penpartner, graphire and intuos models but it did not
work.  I have rewritten the wacom driver for gpm, to use it you need at least
gpm version 1.18.2 . Since 1.18.2, the old wacom driver has been replaced with
my driver for wacom graphire, penpartner and ultrapad products.</P>
<P>However, if you own an old artpad, use gpm &lt; 1.18.1 and try:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>killall gpm ; gpm -t wacom -m /dev/ttyS0</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and it should work.</P>
<P> 
If you own a graphire, use gpm > 1.18.1 instead and use</P>
<P>for the relative (mouse-like) mode:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>killall gpm ; gpm -t wacom -o relative -m /dev/ttyS0</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

for the absolute (tablet-like) mode:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>killall gpm ; gpm -t wacom -o absolute -m /dev/ttyS0</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Of course, you get only the buttons and the movement
function, pressure and tilt are not supported because they are not too useful
in text-based applications. <BR> 
There is no support for ultrapad macro buttons or graphire mouse wheel.</P>
<P>If you use gpm and XFree86, you may or may not run in problems, because
normally a device can be opened only by one program at a time. There are two
solutions for that:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The gpm repeater mode. If you start gpm with the &#34;-R protocol&#34;
option, it will repeat all data it gets
to the device /dev/gpmdata. Let us say, you have a ps2 type mouse and your gpm
call looks like:
<EM>gpm -t ps2 -Rmman</EM>
then gpm gets your ps2 mouse data and tries to translate this into a mman
packet, which it will emit to /dev/gpmdata. Unfortunately, gpm can translate to
only a few protocols at the time of writing. Since gpm 1.18.1, these protocols to which can be translated are marked with an asterix at the first column.
Again, do a 
<EM>gpm -t help</EM> 
to get the list.

<P>If you want to omit the translation and only get the data byte for
byte, just call
<EM>gpm -t ps2 -R raw</EM>
. You can then make XFree use that second device by putting the line
<EM>Device      "/dev/gpmdata"</EM>
in your XF86Config in the pointer section or the XInput section.</P>

</LI>
<LI>If you use startx, you can modify it that it does a
<EM>gpm -k</EM>
before the X-Server is started. This option kills a running gpm.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>XInput support in XFree is configured basically in a file called XF86Config.

</H2>


<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765705b"></A> 
Please notice the different syntax between
XFree 3 and XFree 4: <BR>
In XFree 3 configuration is done in the section "XInput" with one subsection for each device. XFree 3 has keywords.<BR>
In XFree 4 configuration is done with one section "InputDevice" for each device. All Settings are "options", with one exception: the identifier statement. The Alwayscore option goes to the Serverlayout section.</P>
<P>Because the usage can be seen from the above examples, this difference will be considered
as clear for the rest of the document. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Section Module</A>
</H2>


<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765706"></A> 
XInput support in XFree is reached due to the use of modules. The wacom device
driver module file for XFree 3 is called 
<A HREF="#_driverlepied">xf86Wacom.so</A>, for XFree 4 the filename changed to wacom_drv.o.
The files are located usually in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/ or in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input. We have to specify
in the &#34;Module&#34; section that we want to load this driver (look at above snippets):</P>
<P>XFree 3: Load &#34;xf86Wacom.so&#34; <BR>
XFree 4: Load &#34;wacom&#34;</P>

<P>This has to appear only once per XF86Config file.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Device Type (XF3) and Type (XF4)</A>
</H2>


<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765707"></A> 
A physical device can be:
<UL>
<LI>The tip of your pen</LI>
<LI>The eraser of your pen</LI>
<LI>A mouse like the Wacom products lens cursor, 4d-mouse, graphire-mouse</LI>
<LI>The airbrush</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The  penpartner and graphire products simply recognize the type of a device,
but they can not distinguish them. For example, you can not use two different
pens, say, one configured red  and one configured blue - all what these
products say is: &#34;I found a pen tip on my surface&#34;, or &#34;I found
an Eraser on my surface&#34;, or &#34;I found a mouse on my surface&#34;.</P>

<P>XInput maps the device types to devices, these device types are later
specified in XF86Config. For XFree 3 this is a subsection in the 
section XInput, for XFree 4 this goes to individuell InputDevice sections.<BR>
The devicetypes are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>WacomStylus</CODE>
Tip of a pen or airbrush</LI>
<LI><CODE>WacomEraser</CODE>
Eraser of a pen or airbrush</LI>
<LI><CODE>WacomCursor</CODE>
Mice, like graphire mouse, lens cursor, 4d-mouse</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As you can see from above examples, device types are specified with the keyword
&#34;Devicetype&#34; in XFree 3 and with Option &#34;Type&#34; in XFree 4.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 DeviceName (XF3) and Identifier (XF4)</A>
</H2>


<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765708"></A> </P>
<P>You must give every configured device a unique name. This name will be used
later in your program to talk to that device. You can choose this name free.
This statement is mandantory.
In XFree 3 you will use the &#34;Devicename&#34; keyword, in XFree 4 you will use the Identifier &#34;name&#34; keyword. Please notice that Identifier is not an Option !</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8 Port (XF3) and Device (XF4)</A>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765709"></A> 
XInput wants to know at which serial port this device can be found. This
allows me to use two different tablets at the same time, for example a graphire
connected to /dev/ttyS0 and a penpartner connected to /dev/ttyS1.</P>


<H3>USB Tablets</H3>

<P>USB is treated as a serial line too,
so this statement is mandantory. If you connect your product to the USB, you have to specify this with

<H3>Switching The Mouse Off</H3>

<P>Most people use both, the mouse and the tablet for core pointer functions. 
However, if you want to switch your mouse off and only will use your tablet, here comes the trick for that:<BR>
First, specify AllowMouseOpenFail in section ServerFlags. 
Then set the device to a file which must 
not exist (fake or dummy). Do not set it to /dev/null as this will eat up
your CPU-time.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765711"></A> 
The intuos product is more efficient than penpartner and graphire because it
can distinguish many devices of the same type. This means that it is now
possible to use two pens, one configured red  and one configured blue. As you
see, the use of device types is not enough information to handle different
pens. Therefore, each intuos device, be it a pen, ink pen, mouse, or whatever
has a serial number, which you can specify to aid XInput in resolving the
right device. This would look like:</P>

If you set a device in mode absolute, this means, that the active area of the
tablet will be mapped to the screen. Every time you go down to the tablet at
the same point with an absolute device the pointer will appear at the same

<P>If you set a device in mode relative, you will get the well known behavior of a

<P>The other pointer is used by applications which want more information, like

<P>If you do not specify Alwayscore in your XF86Config, then this device is

<P>If Alwayscore is given, then your device acts as core pointer (in addition to the mouse) as well as it sends tilt and pressure information to applications which opened the device in extension mode. </P>
<P>You can configure two different logical devices, one in Core-Mode and one in

It is possible to define more than one active area on the same tablet:
Define as many subsections as you need with the same Port Statement but with

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765722"></A> 
<A HREF="#_gimp">Gimp</A>
has built-in XInput support since Version 1.1.x.</P>
<P>Gimp must know which devices it should use and in what mode. You have to open
the
<EM>File/Dialogs/Input Devices</EM>
- dialog for setting this up. You will find two listbox-controls at the top of
that window labeled
<EM>Device</EM>
and
<EM>Mode</EM>
. Choose the device to set up from the
<EM>Device</EM>
control and choose a mode from the
<EM>Mode</EM>
-control.</P>
<P>The modes are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>disabled: Gimp does not use this device.</LI>
<LI>window: <BR>
Gimp uses this device, the cursor is drawn by the application. The cursor can not leave the active window.
The active area of the tablet is mapped to this window.</LI>
<LI>screen:<BR>
Gimp uses this device. The cursor is drawn by the X-Server. The cursor can move over the whole screen.
The active area of the tablet is mapped to the screen.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>If you see two cursors linked to your device, you have two solutions:
<UL>
<LI>Use mode screen but you may or may not loose the special gimp-tool cursors; If
so, all cursors will be replaced by the pen cursor.</LI>
<LI>Configure two different devices in the XF86Config file, one
<EM>AlwaysCore</EM>
and one not. Tell gimp to use the later one in mode window. If you do so and
have one of the statements
<EM>TopX, TopY, BottomX, BottomY</EM>
in your XF86Config, take care to use the same adjustments for that statements in
both logical devices. If you do not, then you get confused because X draws a
cursor of the one device while the other is active. the effect of this is a
cursor, very far away from the point of action (hotspot).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Below the two listbox-controls there is a tab-control with the two register
tabs
<EM>Axes</EM>
and
<EM>Keys</EM>
.
<EM>Axes</EM>
assigns an axis a function, it is mostly not necessary to change this. But
think about a touch-screen device which is built in a table rotated by 90
degrees, then you might want to swap the x and y axis.</P>

<P>Some tablets have so called macro keys at the top which may hold some often used functions. The 
<A NAME="_macrokeys"></A> 
<EM>Keys</EM>
tab lets you assign a character to a macro key. For example, you can put Ctrl+Shift+R, to a macro key. If you 
activate this key, then the rulers are toggled. <BR>
The current Wacom driver supports only the macro keys of the ultrapad series,
the macro area of the intuos products is not yet usable for that. </P>

<P>Now we should talk about how the devices can be used. Open the
<EM>File/Dialogs/Device Status</EM>
-dialog. Open an image.</P>
<P>You set up each device independently from each other in gimp.</P>
<P>If you move the cursor with different devices in the image window you can see
the devices change in the Device Status dialog. If you pick a tool, brush,
pattern or color with a device, again the changes are reflected in the dialog.
You can save the settings in the Status Dialog, so that they will be restored
before your next session.</P>

The buttons of the devices are as different as the devices are:<BR>
A pen has at least a tip, but it may have one or two side switches and an
eraser. A mouse may have up to 32 buttons (but usually 3). Buttons are numbered
from 1 to the number of buttons. With the next two utilities you can change, to

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Button Mapping with xmodmap for Devices in Core Mode</A>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765725"></A> 
xmodmap will only modify the Core Pointer. As there is only one Core pointer at
a time, it makes no difference between the physical devices which may become
the Core Pointer. You may set this device manually with <EM>xsetpointer device</EM>.</P>
<P>For the moment, let us forget the whole XInput stuff and
think of a left-hander who just wants to swap the left and right mouse buttons.
You would execute 
<EM>xmodmap -pp</EM>
to look what the current assignment is. You
should get the following table back:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

Physical        Button
Button          Code

3              3      # ( Middle Button )

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>To swap the buttons, you do a 
<EM>xmodmap -e &#34;pointer = 2 1 3&#34;</EM>
, and to get
back, 
<EM>xmodmap -e &#34;pointer = default&#34;</EM>
. This should work with every device
with at least two buttons. Note that  the term

<P>Back to XInput now. If you use the gimp, you may want to change the button

want to swap the two side-switches of the pen). Frederic Lepied has written a
utility called

<P>If you have none of your devices configured 
<EM>AlwaysCore</EM>
and you want
a device to become  the core-pointer, then xsetpointer must be used.</P>
<P>Do a 
<EM>xsetpointer Devicename</EM>
. The old core-device (usually the
mouse) is not usable anymore and the one you specified should be active. For
example I can make the graphire mouse the standard core device from within a
running XFree.</P>
<P><EM>xsetpointer -l</EM>
lists all devices and the modes they are in.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765729"></A> 
Some devices have macro keys or pads on them, to which a scancode or string may be 
assigned. This works only for devices in extension mode and is therefore done
in the application you want use the keys with.</P>
<P><EM>xinput -l</EM> gives information about the number of keys and things 
like the first scancode.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 Utilities to use more than one tablet and for toggle support on  / off</A>
</H2>


<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765730"></A> </P>
<P>I own myself 3 tablets of Wacom and use them on my notebook. Whenever no
tablets are connected and
I start X, I have to wait very long until the driver gives up. If xdm is used,
this increases to multiple of  that timeouts.</P>
<P>I have written two utilities which should make live easier with that:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The shell script 
<B>sx</B>
for those who use startx. 
sx uses the dialog tool to present a nice menu where the user can choose:
<UL>
<LI>one of up to 10 devices (tablet, joystick, ...)</LI>
<LI>for notebooks, which display to use (internal or external display)</LI>
<LI>which window-manager to use</LI>
</UL>




</LI>
<LI>The small gtk-application 
<B>xinput-chooser</B>
for those who use xdm.
xinput-chooser presents the user a menu whenever the xdm login screen is shown,
from which one of up to ten different configurations can be chosen.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The concept behind this is that a XF86Config file is split in at least a
XF86Config.bare file, which holds the information common to all configurations,
and various snippets, each of them holding the special information for a
particular configuration.</P>
<P>The two utilities will then concat the parts back to a working configuration.</P>

<P>You can get this packet from
<A HREF="http://www.runkel-it.de/download">http://www.runkel-it.de/download</A>
, it is named xinput_chooser_sr.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Gnome and Gimp only work like a usual mouse, without pressure and tilt. Gimp Input Devices Dialog shows &#34;No Input Devices&#34;</A>
</H2>

<P>It seems that you have not compiled your gtk with XInput-support.
Please rebuild gtk and use <EM>./configure --with-xinput=xfree</EM> for building the Makefile. Then do a <EM>make &amp;&amp; make install</EM>. Then rebuild your gimp
so that it uses this extendet gtk.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Is the wheel of the mouse (cursor) supported ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes, it generates button 4 and button 5 events.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 How can I find out the intuos Serial Num of my tool ?</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 How can I use the intuos/artpad/ultrapad  macro area ?</A>
</H2>

<P>You can not use the intuos macro area, sorry. <BR>
Only Artpad / Ultrapad Macro stripes work. 
Read the section about 
<A HREF="#_macrokeys">Gimp Keys</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Is it possible to define multiple active areas on the same tablet ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes, read the section about the 
<A HREF="#_Toc465765719">Top... Statements</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 Can I use more than one tablet at the same time ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes, read the 
<A HREF="#_Toc465765709">'Port and Device' section</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8 The Wacom Driver eats my CPU Time. Any Hint ?</A>
</H2>

<P>This mostly happes under the following condition:<BR>
AllowMouseOpenFail was specified and the device is set to /dev/null.
Set the device to a nonexisting file instead, for example /dev/fake, and you 
will get back your CPU time. See the examples for this under 
the 
<A HREF="#_Toc465765709">'Port and Device' section</A>.</P>

<P>Another reason may be that there were too many interrupts produced.<BR>
I was told, that hdparm -u1 /dev/hdx (replace x with your drive letter) may help. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.9">7.9 The Cursor 'dances' around</A>
</H2>

<P>Most Graphire's are known to be weak for that, intuos seems to be better but
still not perfect. This seems to be a hardware problem.<BR>
Possible Solutions:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Put your tablet as far as possible away from all emitting devices like
monitors, printers, computers, AC-adapters.</LI>
<LI>Use a modified driver with a filter algorythm. Many of them are in development right now but none of them seem to be the cruncher.</LI>
<LI>If using an IDE drive, try hdparm -u1 /dev/hdx (replace x with your drive letter) </LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 NCurses programs only support cut and paste with my new gpm </A>
</H2>

<P>You probably mixed a new gpm with an old gpm library.
Or You use an old client which searches the socket gpmctl in /var/run
instead in /dev. In the later case you have two options: get new clients
and recompile them or change gpm.h so that it uses /var/run instead of /dev 
and recompile gpm and libgpm.</P>
