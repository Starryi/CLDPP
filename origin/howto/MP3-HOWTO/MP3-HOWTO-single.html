<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Hardware Requirements &amp; Performance Issues.</A></H2>

<P>Digital Audio processing is a resource intensive task that relies heavily on
the processing and I/O capabilities of a system.  I would strongly recommend
a Pentium class machine as a minimum.</P>
<P>If you are going to be encoding from an analogue audio source via the line or microphone input, a PCI soundcard will give the best results. The I/O performance difference between an ISA and PCI based card is significant, over 132 MBytes/sec for PCI (quote taken from the <EM>PCI-HOWTO</EM>).  Naturally, the better the quality of the soundcard in terms of its signal-to-noise ratio, the better the encoded MP3.  I've been using the Soundblaster PCI128 and just switched over to a Soundblaster Live Value; both cards give good audio performance, but the Live has significantly better S/N ratios, good enough for semi-pro audio work.  Remember the old data processing maxim:- garbage in - garbage out!</P>
<P>Creative have a Beta driver for the Soundblaster Live! which can be
downloaded from:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://developer.soundblaster.com/linux/">http://developer.soundblaster.com/linux/</A></P>
<P>When recording analogue audio to a hard disk, more commonly referred to as
direct to disk or d2d recording, the performance of the disk, and its
interface is critical.  If you are using an IDE based system, mode 4
or UDMA is preferable as the transfer rate is sufficiently high enough to provide reliable data transfer without problems.</P>
<P>The ideal solution would be to use a SCSI based system as the drives and
interface have far better throughput capabilities, a sustained 5MB/sec
for SCSI 1 through to 40-80MB/sec for ultra-ultra2/wide SCSI. IDE can peak at
anything from 8.3 MB/s to 66 MB/s for Ultra DMA mode 4 but these speeds are peak,
average transfer rates will be slower.  If you can find, or afford, an AV
SCSI drive, go for it.  AV drives have had the read/write head system optimised for continuous data transference; other SCSI and IDE drives normally cannot sustain continuous data transfer as the write head heats up!</P>
<P>Naturally a drive that has cache will give more consistent results than one that
doesn't, as the cache will act as a buffer if the heads do lift or it cannot
handle the throughput.</P>
<P>If your drive isn't up to spec, your recording will suffer from dropouts and
glitches, where the drive failed to record the signal.  If you are recording
one-off events, such as live performances invest in a good SCSI based disk
system.</P>
<P>Another cause of d2d dropouts is a heavily loaded system.  Background tasks
can cause the system to momentarily glitch.  Its recommended to run as few
background services as you can, especially networked based services. For
more information about setting network services, and startup scripts please
refer to the <EM>SAG</EM> and <EM>NAG</EM> guides.</P>
<P>Virtual memory paging will also cause glitches, so run with as much physical
RAM as you can, I'd recommend at least 32 Mb, but you may well need more.</P>
<P>For those wanting to extract the most out of their system, optimising the
kernel probably wouldn't do any harm either.</P>
<P>For streaming MP3's the better the network card the better the throughput, naturally a 100Mb interface will give better throughput than a 10Mb interface :)</P>
<P>While the hardware specifications above will give you a decent system to
encode audio data, don't discount using older, lower spec kit if that's all
you have access to.  </P>
<P>It'll be a good challenge for a sys-admin to tweak a low-spec system to
give good results, and the end result will probably be a happier Linux box.</P>
<P>Another important issue is the audio cabling.  Cheap, poor quality cables
and connectors will result in poor recording quality.  If your soundcard has
the option to use phono, sometimes referred to as RCA connectors, use them. 
Gold plated contacts will also help maintain audio quality, as will keeping
audio cables away from data cables as there will be a chance of interference
between them.</P>
<P>But don't forget, spending a fortune on the best audio cabling will be lost
if the rest of the system hasn't been optimised.</P>
<P>For encoding MP3's from CD-ROM, the speed or type of drive will determine the
time taken to read the raw information from it.  A single speed drive will
probably be too slow for all but the most patient.</P>
<P>Your CD-ROM must be connected to your soundcard if you want to hear what you
are recording, either using the internal connector or by connecting headphone's to the headphone output, although you will not be able to listen to MP3's through the CD-ROM headphone socket!</P>
<P>For detailed instructions on setting up soundcards, now would be an excellent
time to read the <EM>Sound-HOWTO</EM>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Software Requirements.</A></H2>

<P>Converting audio to MP3's is normally a 2 stage process, first the audio is
recorded into a WAV format, then the WAV is then converted into an MP3. Some
utilities will do both processes in one go for you.</P>
<P>The format you wish to encode audio from, CD or direct audio, will determine what software tools you need to produce the WAV file.</P>
<P>If you are wanting to encode from audio input, you will need a program that will record from your soundcard's input and save the results in a WAV format. Below are some useful utilities (most of the comments are taken from the respective website of the app.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Rippers &amp; WAV Recorders</A>
</H2>

<P>To grab from analog audio line-in.
<EM>Wavrec</EM></P>
<P>Wavrec is distributed as part of wavplay, which can be downloaded from:- </P>
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/</A></P>
<P>To convert CD audio data to WAV format, sometimes known as CD ripping:</P>
<P><EM>CDDA2WAV</EM></P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/cdrom/">http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/cdrom/</A></P>
<P><EM>Cdparanoia</EM></P>
<P>Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, commonly known on the net as a 'ripper'. The application is built on top of the
Paranoia library, which is doing the real work (the Paranoia source is included in the cdparanoia source distribution). Like the original cdda2wav,
cdparanoia package reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw 16 bit linear PCM. Compared to cdda2wav, it's much slower but really gets the best results you can get even from CDs that are difficult to rip for scratches or other read-errors.  </P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/index.html">http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/index.html</A></P>
<P><EM>RipEnc</EM></P>
<P>RipEnc is a bourne shell script frontend to Cdparanoia, cdda2wav, tosha and Bladeenc, 8hz-mp3, l3enc. It utilizes CDDB lookups to automate the naming of songs as they are ripped. A manual naming option is also available. The entire CD can be ripped or you can pick the songs to rip. ID3 tags are also supported.</P>

<P><EM>Cd2mp3</EM></P>
<P>cd2mp3 is a freeware software, designed to handle 2 other programs cdda2wav(that rips the tracks from cd) and lame (that encodes the mp3s)</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://sertaozinho.org/cd2mp3/index.html">http://sertaozinho.org/cd2mp3/index.html</A></P>
<P><EM>RipperX</EM></P>
<P>RipperX is a GTK program to rip CD audio and encode mp3s. It has plugins for
cdparanoia, BladeEnc, Lame Mp3 encoder, XingMp3enc, 8hz-mp3 and the
ISO v2 encoder. It also has support for CDDB and ID3 tags.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.digitallabyrinth.com/linux/ripperX/">http://www.digitallabyrinth.com/linux/ripperX/</A></P>
<P><EM>Grip</EM></P>
<P>Grip is a GTK-based CD-player and CD-ripper/MP3-encoder. It has the ripping capabilities of cdparanoia built in, but can also use external rippers (such as cdda2wav). It also provides an automated frontend for MP3 encoders, letting you take a disc and transform it easily straight into MP3s. The CDDB protocol is supported for retrieving track information from disc database servers.  Grip works with DigitalDJ to provide a unified "computerized" version of your music collection.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Encoders</A>
</H2>

<P>To convert the WAV file to MP3 format you will need an encoder:</P>
<P><EM>Blade's MP3 Encoder</EM></P>
<P>BladeEnc is a freeware MP3 encoder. It is based on the same ISO compression routines as mpegEnc, so you can expect roughly the same, or better, quality . The main difference is the appearance and speed. BladeEnc doesn't have a nice, user-friendly interface like mpegEnc, but it is more than three times faster, and it works with several popular front-end graphical user interfaces. </P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://bladeenc.cjb.net">http://bladeenc.cjb.net</A></P>
<P><EM>Lame</EM></P>
<P>In the great history of GNU naming, LAME stands for LAME Ain't an Mp3 Encoder.  LAME is not an mp3 encoder.  It is a GPL'd patch against the dist10 ISO demonstration source.  LAME is totally incapable of producing an mp3 stream. It is incapable of even being compiled by itself. You need the ISO source for this software to work.  The ISO demonstration source is also freely available, but any commercial use (including distributing free encoders) may require a license agreement from FhG (Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, Germany). </P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/">http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/</A></P>
<P><EM>Gogo</EM></P>
<P>This is a very fast MP3 encoder for x86-CPU, which is based on LAME ver 3.29beta and optimized by PEN@MarineCat, Keiichi SAKAI, URURI, kei and shigeo.

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Setting up your system.</A></H2>

<P>This section will describe the basics of setting up your Linux system to
record audio from either an analogue or CD-ROM source.</P>
<P>I'm basing this section around my Intel based Linux system which is running Redhat, but should be reasonably distribution neutral. If you have any success in using this HOWTO on other hardware, please get in touch.</P>
<P>Naturally a reasonable prerequisite is a working soundcard.  At this point in
the HOWTO, I invite you to read the excellent <EM>Linux Sound HOWTO</EM>, by Jeff
Tranter.  After which a good read of the <EM>Linux Sound Playing HOWTO</EM>, by
Yoo C. Chung.  Both of the above mentioned HOWTO's cover the details of
getting a sound system working under Linux far better than I could.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Setting up for Analogue Audio Capture</A>
</H2>

<P>Firstly, set up your audio.  There are a multitude of ways to route audio
before it gets to your Linux box, some common ones are:</P>
<P>Line out to Soundcard Line in.  Most audio devices have a Line output sockets.  Line level is a standard that specifies what voltage the audio device
will send out. If I remember correctly it is 500mV for domestic and Semi Pro
devices, and 750mV for Pro audio devices.  I would guess that the standard
set for most soundcards will be 500mV, but some of the newer Pro audio may
be to the higher standard  It shouldn't make too much difference unless you
are recording at very high levels. </P>
<P>The Line level output is normally used to connect HI-FI equipment to an
amplifier, so things such as Tape Decks, Radio Tuners, CD players, DAT
machines and Mini-Disc players should connect without problem.  Turntables
can be more of a problem, see below for more information. </P>
<P>You could capture audio from VCR's as well.  Most VCR's will either have
Line out for sound, or you can Get a Line out from a SCART socket if your
VCR has one.</P>
<P>Amplifier Tape out to Soundcard Line in,  Soundcard Line out to Amplifier Tape in.  This configuration is essentially replacing a traditional tape recorder connected to your HI-FI amplifier with your Linux system.  The Soundcard Line out to Tape in allows monitoring of the recording levels.</P>
<P>Mike to Soundcard Mike in.  The voltages generated by microphones is very much smaller than those used in Line level devices.  If you were to plug a Microphone
into the Soundcard Line in, chances are you would never record anything.  </P>
<P><EM>WARNING, doing the reverse, plugging a Line level device into the Soundcards Microphone input, can damage your soundcard!!</EM></P>
<P>Turntable to Mike in.  </P>
<P>Many thanks to Mark Tranchant for the following.</P>
<P><EM>The raw output from a record deck cartridge is very low level.
However, you cannot plug it directly into a microphone input and expect good
results. The output requires equalization, as records are mastered with less
bass and more treble to optimize the physics of the moving needle. This
equalization is carefully defined and referred to as RIAA equalization. You
*need* to run the output through a phono preamp first, and then into a line
input.</EM></P>
<P>Music keyboards &amp; synths should be connected to the Soundcards Line in, with guitars connecting to Line in via a DI (Direct Injection, used to convert the signal to Line level) box. </P>
<P>Before you plug in anything into your soundcard, make sure the volume levels are turned down to minimum, or if using microphones they are either turned off or away from speakers.   </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Setting up for CD-ROM Audio Capture</A>
</H2>

<P>Setting up your Linux system to extract audio data from CD-ROM is reasonably
straight forward. </P>
<P>If you can hear a track playing from your CD-ROM through your speakers or
amplifier, connected to your soundcard, then there's a reasonable chance you
should be able to record from it.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Additional Setting up</A>
</H2>

<P>Log in as per normal to your system, then using a mixer program set the
recording levels that are loud enough to give you a decent recording level,
but aren't too loud and distorting.  I normally just judge this by ear,
after a while you'll get to know what levels are best for your kit.</P>
<P>I recommend either turning off all unnecessary services or switching to the
single user runlevel, especially when encoding from an audio source. This is
to ensure that the bare minimum of services are running and thus minimising
system glitches when recording.</P>
<P>I've set up a separate SCSI drive, exclusively to record the audio to, which
I'll refer to as /mp3.  I've done this mainly for the performance gains
in using a SCSI drive.  Also, recording onto a dedicated drive, where you
are almost certain the head isn't going to suddenly skip to another part of
the drive as you are writing audio data to it, is a good thing :)</P>
<P>For details on setting up a Linux system with multiple disk drives, a good
read of the <EM>Multi-Disk-HOWTO</EM>, by Stein Gjoen may be useful.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Encoding from Audio.</A></H2>

<P>Firstly, make sure you have enough space on your drive.  At CD quality, 44.1
Khz 16 Bit stereo, 1 minute takes nearly 10 Mb (5 MB per channel). </P>
<P>I normally record at DAT quality, which is 48 Khz 16 Bit stereo.</P>
<P>Using wavrec I use the following syntax:
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ /usr/local/bin/wavrec -t 60 -s 48000 -S /mp3/temp.wav
</PRE>
<HR>

The first part is an explicit path to wavrec.  The '-t 60' specifies the
length of time to record for, in seconds.</P>
<P>The third option, -s 48000 refers to the sample rate in samples/sec. (48000 is the rate for DAT, 44100 is CD)</P>
<P>The last option is the path to the output file.</P>
<P>To see the full set of options, run waverec -help, or see it's man page.</P>
<P>This will produce your WAV file  Next you will need to encode it into MP3
format.</P>
<P>Use bladdenc with the following command line.
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ /usr/local/bin/bladeenc &lt;em/[source file] [destination file]/ -br 256000
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The -br option  sets the bit rate, in this case I've set the rate to the maximum
rate of 256k bits/s.  The path to bladeenc may also be different on your
system to the one I've used in my example.</P>
<P>To see the full set of options, run bladeenc -help, actually this is an
invalid option, but will display the list of options.</P>
<P>The same encoding using Lame (as well as Gogo as it is based on Lame) would need the command line
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ /usr/local/bin/lame &lt;em/[source file] [destination file]/ -b 256
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Encoding from CD-ROM.</A></H2>

<P>In a similar way to encoding from audio, encoding from CD is a 2 stage process.  Firstly the audio data is extracted from the cd and converted into a wav file.  Then the wav file is converted into MP3.</P>
<P>There are basically 2 types of encoders, console based and X based.  Both do the same job, but the X based are easier to use (and look nicer).</P>
<P>Again, before you start to encode, check you will have enough drive space on your system.           </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 Command Line encoding</A>
</H2>


<P>I've written a very simple Perl script that will rip and encode tracks
from a CD.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#!/usr/bin/perl

if ($ARGV[0] ne "") {

$count = 1;

do {
 
$cdcap = system("cdparanoia", $count, "/mp3/cdda.wav");
$track = "$ARGV[1]/track".$count.".mp3";
$enc = system("bladeenc  /mp3/cdda.wav $track -br 256000");
$count++;

}
until $count > $ARGV[0];
exit;
}

else {
print "Usage cdriper [no of tracks] [destination directory]\n\n";
}
</PRE>
<HR>

Please note: The above script is very basic and has nothing fancy, like
error checking or CDDB.  Improve at your leisure :)</P>
<P>The main lines of interest are: </P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
$cdcap = system("cdparanoia", $count, "/mp3/cdda.wav");
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>This line calls the CD ripper, cdparanoia.  Cdparanoia converts raw CD audio
data to WAV format.</P>
<P>I'm using Cdparanoia, but if you wish to use CDDA2WAV, the command line
would be:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
$cdcap = system("cdda2wav", $count, "/mp3/cdda.wav");
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The salient options are $count, which is the number of tracks to rip, and
then the path for the outputted WAV file.  In my example this will go to a
tmp directory on my MP3 SCSI drive.</P>
<P>The WAV file is then converted into a MP3 file using Bladeenc.</P>
<P>I've written this Perl script in order to rip a CD without having to rip and
encode each track, and without having to use the batch mode of Cdparanoia. 
This cuts down on free disk space needed as Cdparanoia's batch mode will
rip the whole disk, and take up anything upto 600 Meg.</P>
<P>If you wanted to use Lame or Gogo, replace the encoder line with:  
<HR>
<PRE>
$enc = system("lame  /mp3/cdda.wav $track -b 256");
</PRE>
<HR>

or
<HR>
<PRE>
$enc = system("gogo  /mp3/cdda.wav $track -b 256");

</PRE>
<HR>
 </P>
<P>The -d option sets the directory for log files and templates.</P>
<P>Below is the list of command-line options:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        -c [filename] 

Parse as a configuration file. Please note that any command line
parameters you supply after this override whatever is in file. Also note that
icecast.conf in the current directory is already parsed when you specify
this file, so anything in icecast.conf not overridden by the new configuration
file will be used by the server. 

        -P [port] 

This is the port used for all client, source, and admin connections. It's set
to 8000 by default. 

        -m [max clients] 

Allow this number of client connections. When this number is reached, all
client connections will be refused with 'HTTP/1.0 504 Server Full' 

        -p [encoder password] 

This sets the password that the encoder must use to be allowed to stream
to the server. Note that if you have compiled the server with crypt()
support, this argument must be an encrypted string. 

        -b 

This will send the icecast server into the background (i.e daemon process).
To use the admin commands now, you have to connect to the server as an
admin, using some sort of telnet client. 

        -d [directory] 

Make all log files created by icecast, and all templates that icecast looks
for be relative to this directory. 
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>So, thats the server started, but you now need to connect an MP3 source to the server. </P>
<P>You can choose from two applications which deliver MP3 data to the server, Shout and LiveIce.</P>

<H3>Shout</H3>

<P>Shout provides Icecast with a static playlist of MP3's to stream and is included with Icecast.</P>
<P>You create the playlist if the MP3 files you want to stream with the following:
<HR>
<PRE>
find [MP3 directory] -name '*.mp3' -print > playlist
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>At it's most basic level, to start the shout service, issue the following:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox bin]# ./shout megajukebox -P hackme -p playlist
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The -P option specifies the password needed to add a mount-point to Icecast, this is the aptly set as <EM>hackme</EM>..... I strongly suggest you change it otherwise someone may :)  The -p option specifies the location of the playlist file. 
Below is a list of all of the command line options:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox bin]# ./shout
Usage: shout &lt;host> [options] [[-b &lt;bitrate] file.mp3]...
Options:
        -B &lt;directory>       - Use directory for all shout's files.
        -C &lt;file>    - Use file as configuration file
        -D &lt;dj_file> - Run this before every song (system())
        -P &lt;password>        - Use specified password
        -S              - Display all settings and exit
        -V              - Use verbose output
        -X &lt;desc>    - Use specified description.
        -a              - Turn on automatic bitrate (transfer) correction
        -b &lt;bitrate> - Start using specified bitrate
        -d              - Activate the dj.
        -e &lt;port>    - Connect to port on server.
        -f              - Skip files that don't match the specified bitrate
        -g &lt;genre>   - Use specified genre
        -h              - Show this text
        -i              - Use old icy headers
        -k              - Don't truncate the internal playlist (continue)
        -l              - Go on forever (loop)
        -m &lt;mount>   - Use specified mount point
        -n &lt;name>    - Use specified name
        -o              - Turn of the bitrate autodetection.
        -p &lt;playlist>        - Use specified file as a playlist
        -r              - Shuffle playlist (random play)
        -s              - (Secret) Don't send meta data to the directory server
        -u &lt;url>     - Use specified url
        -v              - Show version
        -x              - Don't update the cue file (saves cpu)
        -z              - Go into the background (Daemon mode)
        -t              - Enable title streaming

<H3>LiveIce</H3>


<P>LiveIce can work in 2 modes, it can pass a playlist to Icecast or can pass live audio from the soundcard.</P>
<P>After untaring and reading the README concerning building the package, make sure you have mpg123 installed and available as LiveIce requires it.</P>
<P>There are two ways of configuring LiveIce editing the config file with vi/emacs/or whatever or by using the TK based configuration tool, which is a pretty way of editing it :)</P>
<P>The best place for describing the internals of liveice.cfg can be found at LiveIce's homepage where Scott covers all of the options. </P>
<P>This is a copy of my config file with LiveIce set to mixer mode (stream from a list of MP3's)</P>
<P>NOTE:  I've added comments to the file, so if you cut and paste make sure the comments haven't wrapped around to a new line otherwise LiveIce will not work :)

</PRE>
<HR>

If you get this far, it looks like things are working, but I'm sure you'll want to stream more than the demo files!</P>
<P>You'll need to compile a playlist of the MP3's you want to stream.  This will be a static list users will not be able to alter this list or make requests.  This playlist is named playlist.m3u and is located by default in the root directory.</P>
<P>To compile a playlist of all MP3's in a particular directory (or disk) use the following command:
<HR>
<PRE>
find [MP3 directory] -name "*.mp3" -print > playlist.m3u
</PRE>
<HR>

By default the server uses port 2711 which is where your listeners will connect to. If you need to change this it can be done in the config file.</P>
<P>The server can be remotely administered by telneting to it's admin port, by default port 2710 like so:
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox Fluid-Beta2J]$ telnet localhost 2710

<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Litestream</A>
</H2>


<P>Litestream is similar in it's operation to Icecast.  The system is composed of the streamer and the source.</P>
<P>To start the streamer you issue a command in the following format:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ litestream &lt;source port> &lt;stream host> &lt;stream port> &lt;max listeners> &lt;log ident> [&lt;yp host> &lt;yp port>]
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The options are as follows:</P>
<P><EM>source port</EM> Is the port you connect the 'audio' source to.</P>
<P><EM>stream host</EM> This is the IP or FQDN of your server (find this out with the hostname command for domain name or cat /etc/hosts for your IP address).</P>
<P><EM>stream port</EM> This is the port number clients connect to.</P>
<P><EM>max listeners</EM> This is the number of clients who can connect to your server.</P>
<P><EM>log ident</EM> Log messages are written to /var/log/messages.  &lt;log ident&gt; is a ident string used to identify the Litestream server, eg.</P>

<P>If you use the ident string 'Litestream' the server starting message in /var/log/messages would look similar to:</P>
<P>
<HR>

<HR>
 </P>
<P>Below is the list of options for source.</P>

<P><EM>ip or hostname</EM> is the hostname or IP address of the computer
running Litestream Server.</P>
<P><EM>port</EM> is the port on which Litestream Server is waiting for a
streaming source.</P>
<P><EM>name</EM> is the name of your stream.</P>
<P><EM>genre</EM> is the genre of your stream.</P>
<P><EM>url</EM> is the URL for your streams web page.</P>
<P><EM>irc</EM> is the IRC channel for your stream.</P>
<P><EM>icq</EM> is your ICQ ID.</P>
<P><EM>aim</EM> is your AIM ID.</P>
<P><EM>public</EM> is either 0 or 1.  0 for private, 1 for public.</P>
<P><EM>reported bitrate</EM> is the stream bitrate which will be reported
to the YP server.  This does not necessarily reflect the actual
bitrate of your stream.</P>
<P><EM>playlist.txt</EM> is the name of the file containing your playlist.</P>
<P><EM>log ident</EM> is the syslog identifier which will be prepended to

<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Apache::MP3 Module</A>
</H2>


<P>The Apache:MP3 module allows the Apache WebServer to stream MP3's.  It does not offer the same level of features as Fluid, Litestream &amp; Icecast.</P>
<P>The module is dependant on MP3::Info and mod_perl, both of which are
available on CPAN.</P>
<P>After downloading the files needed a read of the README will help things!</P>
<P>Firstly make the module, then make the config changes to Apache's config files (your changes may be made in either httpd.conf or srm.conf).</P>
<P>You will also have to create directories for icons and a directory hierarchy for MP3's.</P>
<P>Section 6 of the README details the editing (or creation) of a Perl config file.</P>
<P>This is to preload the MP3::Info module which without this may cause Apache to crash.</P>
<P>In httpd.conf create an entry like so:
<HR>
<PRE>
 Perlrequire /etc/httpd/conf/startup.perl
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Alter the /etc/httpd/conf reference to point to where your Apache config files are located on your system.</P>
<P>Now create the file startup.perl at the location specified above.  At the very minimum you should have the following (again adjust the path of perl to fit your system).</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox conf]$ cat /etc/httpd/conf/startup.perl

#!/usr/bin/perl

use MP3::Info();
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Then restart Apache and point a web browser at one of your new MP3 directories :)</P>
<P>There is more documentation available on Apache::MP3, from the command-line run the following:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox conf]$ perldoc Apache::MP3

<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Firewall Bypassing</A>
</H2>

<P>A large portion of companies and institutions now use firewalls to block users from connecting to certain ports on remote servers.</P>
<P>A way to bypass this is to run your MP3 server using port 80. You will not be able to run a webserver on the same URL or IP address.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>When running Icecast in 'firewall bypass' mode you will need to start shout with the option to set the port to port 80, like so:</P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>Consider this scenario.  A T1 link has a capacity of approx. 1.55 Mb/Sec.  If you stream your MP3's at 128K/Bps stereo, each connecting player will use 256K/Bps, so only 6 users could connect to your MP3 server at any time without problems. And at 256K/Bps, you will not get too many modem users connecting!</P>
<P>So you must make a decision at what to set your stream rates not only on what your server's internet connection is rated at, but what your users will be connecting at.  24K/Bps Stereo will give a reasonable quality signal that 56K modem users will be able to connect to, and for the same T1 line would allow approx. 32 simultaneous connections.</P>

<P>If your server is running on an Intranet, bandwidth issues will still have to be considered especially if your network is running 10M/Sec.</P>
<P>But please let either your ISP or sys admin know you are going to stream otherwise you may be in for a shock. Some ISP's will charge you for bandwidth over a certain limit and sys admins like to know why their network is now running slow :)</P>

<P>I think it's reasonable to assume that record companies will not like you streaming material without their permission or payment of some kind! So what can you stream?  </P>
<P>This is an area where you will need to be aware of the legal ramifications, because it will be you who will be liable.</P>

<P>Playing from file is reasonably straight-forward with all players. The only big difference is some are command-line based and some are X based.</P>
<P>Playing an MP3 file from file requires you to pass the mp3 file as a parameter, like so:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ mpg123 /mp3_files/SampleFile.mp3

or

[dj@megajukebox]$ xaudio /mp3_files/SampleFile.mp3

<P>If you want to play a series of files, pass them in as a list:</P>

[dj@megajukebox]$ alsaplayer /mp3_files/SampleFile1.mp3 /mp3_files/SampleFile2.mp3
</PRE>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="s14">14. MP3 to Minidisc.</A></H2>

<P><EM>By Afra &lt;afra@prongs.org&gt; </EM></P>
<P>To record MP3s from Linux to your minidisc, there are two methods: analog 
and digital. Each method is dependant on the type of soundcard your Linux 
box has. The main difference between analog and digital recordings is the 
sound quality you achieve during recording. 
With an analog recording you may hear some static noise/fuzz, although 
some analog soundcards try to minimize this. Don't think that just 
because you have an analog sound card that you are doomed, because you are 
not. This just means you will have to spend a little time trying to 
minimize the noise by fiddling with mixer settings. </P>
<P>No special software is required, just a regular MP3 player for your Linux 
box. Basically both methods will require a connection from your 
soundcard's output to your Minidic's input. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss14.1">14.1 Analog Recording </A>
</H2>

<P>If your soundcard does not have a "Digital Out" connection, you may will 
have to go via the analogue recording route. </P>
<P>To record an MP3 from your Linux box onto your Minidisc, connect an analog 
chord from your sound card's Line Out to your Minidisc's Line In input. 
Set your Minidisc in the recording mode as you usually would and play the 
MP3. You should see the recording levels on your Minidisc rise. Upon 
playback, you may notice a small or large amount of static noise, which is 
due to your soundcard. </P>
<P>To minimize the static noise during recording, keep your Minidisc's 
recording/volume levels within the -3dB and 0dB range. 
To help clear up the noise you may hear connect up your Minidisc as 
described above and turn on the Recording Mode but do not play an 
MP3. You should still hear the noise and this may help in fiddling with 
your mixer effects. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss14.2">14.2 Digital Recording </A>
</H2>

<P>You will experience better sound quality with digital recording. Connect 
your optical cable (if you have to buy one, the sizes of the MD and card 
port matter, usually 3.5mm but check your soundcard and Minidisc user 
manual) to your sound card's Digital Out. </P>
<P>                                       
The cable should now be glowing on the other end - good. Now, connect the 
glowing end to your minidisc Digital Input. Set your minidisc in record 
mode and play the mp3 from the computer. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss14.3">14.3 Playlists </A>
</H2>

<P>There is one problem when playing MP3 tracklistings: how will your 
Minidisc know when to set an automark when a track jumps onto another 
(ie. change track numbers automatically)? The solution is this MP3 file 
which you can download at 
<A HREF="http://www.prongs.org/minidisc/2sec.zip">http://www.prongs.org/minidisc/2sec.zip</A>. </P>
<P>You may use this file, which is an MP3 file containing 2 seconds of 
silence, to insert before each MP3 on your playlist, so the MD will know 
when to automark. </P>

newer versions of the hardware and / or software listed within this
