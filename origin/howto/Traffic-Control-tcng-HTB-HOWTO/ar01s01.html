      Traffic control is the term given to the entire packet queuing
      subsystem in a network or network device.  Traffic control consists of
      several distinct operations.  Classifying is a mechanism by which to
      identify packets and place them in individual flows or classes.
      Policing is a mechanism by which one limits the number of packets or
      bytes in a stream matching a particular classification.  Scheduling is
      the decision-making process by which packets are ordered and re-ordered
      for transmission.  Shaping is the process by which packets are delayed
      and transmitted to produce an even and predictable flow rate.
    </p><p>
      These many characteristics of a traffic control system can be combined
      in complex ways to reserve bandwidth for a particular flow (or
      application) or to limit the amount of bandwidth available to a
      particular flow or application.
    </p><p>
      One of the key concepts of traffic control is the concept of tokens.
      A policing or shaping implementation needs to calculate the number of
      bytes or packets which have passed at what rate.  Each packet or byte
      (depending on the implementation), corresponds to a token, and the
      policing or shaping implementation will only transmit or pass the packet
      if it has a token available.  A common metaphorical container in
      which an implementation keeps its token is the bucket.  In short, a
      bucket represents the both the number of tokens which can be used
      instantaneously (the size of the bucket), and the rate at which the
      tokens are replenished (how fast the bucket gets refilled).

      control system.
    </p><p>
      Under linux, traffic control has historically been a complex
      endeavor.  The <span class="command"><strong>tc</strong></span> command line tool provides an
      interface to the kernel structures which perform the shaping,
      scheduling, policing and classifying.  The syntax of this command is,
      however, arcane.  The <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span> project provides a much
      friendlier interface to the human by layering a language on top of the
      powerful <span class="command"><strong>tc</strong></span> command line tool.  By writing traffic
      control configurations in <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span> they become easily
      maintainable, less arcane, and importantly also more portable.

      <a class="ulink" href="http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/" target="_top">Hierarchichal Token
      Bucket</a> is a classful qdisc written by Martin Devera 
      with a simpler set of
      configuration parameters than CBQ.  There is a great deal of
      documentation on the author's site and also on 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.docum.org/" target="_top">Stef Coene's website</a> about
      HTB and its uses.  Below is a very brief sketch of the HTB system.
    </p><p>
      Conceptually, HTB is an arbitrary number of token buckets arranged in a
      hierarchy (yes, you probably could have figured that out without my
      sentence).  Let's consider the simplest scenario.
      The primary egress queuing discipline on any device is known as
      the <code class="constant">root</code> qdisc.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="constant">root</code> qdisc will contain one class (complex
      scenarios could have multiple classes attached to the
      <code class="constant">root</code> qdisc).  This single HTB class will be set
      with two parameters, a <code class="constant">rate</code> and a
      <code class="constant">ceil</code>.  These values should be the same for the
      top-level class, and will represent the total
      available bandwidth on the link.
    </p><p>
      In HTB, <code class="constant">rate</code> means the guaranteed bandwidth
      available for a given class and <code class="constant">ceil</code> is short for
      ceiling, which indicates the maximum bandwidth that class is allowed to
      consume.  Any bandwidth used between <code class="constant">rate</code> and
      <code class="constant">ceil</code> is borrowed from a parent class, hence the
      suggestion that <code class="constant">rate</code> and <code class="constant">ceil</code>
      be the same in the top-level class.
    </p><p>
      A number of children classes can be made under this class, each of which
      can be allocated some amount of the available bandwidth from the parent
      class.  In these children classes, the <code class="constant">rate</code> and
      <code class="constant">ceil</code> parameter values need not be the same as
      suggested for the parent class.  This allows you to reserve a specified
      amount of bandwidth to a particular class.  It also
      allows HTB to calculate the ratio of distribution of available bandwidth
      to the ratios of the classes themselves.  This should be more apparent
      in the examples below.
    </p><p>
      Hierarchical Token Bucket implements a classful queuing mechanism for
      the linux traffic control system, and provides <code class="constant">rate</code>
      and <code class="constant">ceil</code> to allow the user to control the absolute
      bandwidth to particular classes of traffic as well as indicate the ratio
      of distribution of bandwidth when extra bandwidth becomes available (up
      to <code class="constant">ceil</code>).
    </p><p>
      Keep in mind when choosing the bandwidth for your top-level class that
      traffic shaping only helps if you are the bottleneck between your LAN
      and the Internet.  Typically, this is the case in home and office
      network environments, where an entire LAN is serviced by a DSL or T1
      connection.
    </p><p>
      In practice, this means that you should probably set the bandwidth for
      your top-level class to your available bandwidth minus a fraction of
      that bandwidth.

      <a class="ulink" href="http://tcng.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Traffic Control Next
      Generation (tcng)</a> is a project by Werner Almesberger to provide
      a powerful, abstract, and uniform language in which to describe traffic
      control structures.  The <span class="command"><strong>tcc</strong></span> parser in the
      <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span> distribution transforms tcng the language into a
      number of output formats.  By default, <span class="command"><strong>tcc</strong></span> will read
      a file (specified as an argument or as STDIN) and print to STDOUT the
      series of <span class="command"><strong>tc</strong></span> commands (see
      <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> below) required to create the desired traffic
      control structure in the kernel.
    </p><p>
      Consult the 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://linux-ip.net/gl/tcng/node159.html" target="_top">parameter
      reference for <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span></a> to see the supported
      queuing disciplines.  Jacob Teplitsky, active on the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://lartc.org/#mailinglist" target="_top">LARTC mailing list</a>
      and a contributor to the tcng project,
      wrote the htb support for <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
      The <span class="command"><strong>tcc</strong></span> tool can produce a number of different types
      of output, but this document will only consider the conventional and
      default output.  Consult the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://linux-ip.net/gl/tcng/" target="_top">TCNG manual</a> for
      more detailed information about the use of <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
      The
      <span class="command"><strong>tcsim</strong></span> tool is a traffic control simulator which
      accepts tcng configuration files and reads a control language to
      simulate the behaviour of a kernel sending and receiving packets with
      the specified control structures.  Although <span class="command"><strong>tcsim</strong></span>
      is a significant portion of the <span class="command"><strong>tcng</strong></span> project,
      <span class="command"><strong>tcsim</strong></span> will not be covered here at all.
