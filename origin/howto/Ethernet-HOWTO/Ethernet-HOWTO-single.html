<H1>Linux Ethernet-Howto</H1>

<H2>by Paul Gortmaker</H2>v2.9, Aug 25, 2003
<HR>
<EM>    This is the Ethernet-Howto, which is a compilation of information
        about which ethernet devices can be used for Linux, and how to
        set them up.   Note that this Howto is focused
        on the hardware and low level driver aspect of the ethernet cards,
        and does not cover the software end of things like <CODE>ifconfig</CODE>
        and <CODE>route</CODE>.  That information is found in various other Linux       documentation.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="main-intro"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>


<P>The Ethernet-Howto contains detailed information on the current level
of support for most of the common ethernet cards available.
It covers common hardware configuration problems, and problems
associated with choosing the right driver, and then getting that
driver loaded and functional.  It does not cover the next
stages of setup (choosing an internet address, routing, etc).
That information can be found in various other Linux documentation.</P>
<P>In the early days of linux, the old ISA type ethernet cards
were the norm.  The ISA bus had no sane or safe way for linux
to determine what cards were installed, or what settings
each card was to use.  This meant that the end user was more
involved in supplying this information to linux, and they
turned to this guide for help on doing this.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the newer PCI bus can be found in nearly every
computer that is out there today, and the ISA bus is left
to collect dust with the 386 and 486 computers of yesteryear.
The designers of the PCI bus recognized the problem with 
card detection on the old ISA bus, and so added support for
each card to be able to communicate to the host computer their
manufacturer and model, and what settings are to be used.</P>
<P>This slow demise of the ISA bus has reduced the involvement of
the end user drastically.  As such, most of today's linux users
would not need to turn to this guide for help.  However there
are always some corner cases where things don't work as expected,
or some problems that need troubleshooting.  And of course
there are still some old ISA computers out there doing thankless
dedicated tasks in the bottom of dark closets too.</P>
<P>This present revision covers ethernet drivers found in 
kernels up to and including version 2.4.21.  Some features
pertaining to the upcoming 2.6 release are also mentioned.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What do I need to to get ethernet working?</A>
</H2>


<P>As a quick overview, you need to: 1) have a plug in ethernet
card or motherboard that has ethernet support built in,
2) determine the brand or make and model of the ethernet
card or on-board ethernet chip, 3) determine if a linux
driver for this model of card/chip does exist, 4) locate
and load this driver, 5) check driver output to verify
it found your card, 6) set or configure network parameters
for the newly detected network interface.</P>

<H2><A NAME="help"></A> <A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 HELP - It doesn't work!</A>
</H2>


<P>Okay, don't panic. This will lead you through the process of
getting things working, even if you have no prior background
in linux or ethernet hardware.</P>
<P>First thing you need to do is figure out what model your card is
so you can determine if Linux has a driver for that particular
card. Different cards typically have different ways of being
controlled by the host computer, and the linux driver (if there
is one) contains this control information in a format that
allows linux to use the card.</P>
<P>If you don't have any manuals or anything of the sort that
tell you anything about the card model, then you can try
using the <CODE>lspci</CODE> utility for obtaining information
on the PCI devices in your computer.  Doing a 
<CODE>cat /proc/pci</CODE> gives similar (but less) information.
For ISA cards, see the section on helping with mystery cards
(reference section:
<A HREF="#mystery">Identifying an Unknown Card</A>).</P>
<P>Now that you know what type of card you have, read through
the details of your particular card in the card specific section
(reference section: 
<A HREF="#card-intro">Vendor Specific...</A>)
which lists in alphabetical order, card manufacturers,
individual model numbers and whether it has a linux driver or
not. If it lists it as `Not Supported' you can pretty much
give up here. If you can't find your card in that list, then
check to see if your card manual lists it as being `compatible'
with another known card type. For example there are hundreds,
if not thousands of different cards made to be compatible
with the original Novell NE2000 design.</P>
<P>Assuming you have found out that a linux driver exists for your
card, you now have to find it and make use of it.
Just because linux has a
driver for your card does <EM>not</EM> mean that it is built
into every kernel.  (The kernel is the core operating
system that is first loaded at boot, and contains drivers
for various pieces of hardware, among other things.)
Depending on who made the particular linux distribution
you are using, there may be only a few pre-built kernels, and
a whole bunch of drivers as smaller separate modules, or there may
be a whole lot of kernels, covering a vast combination of
built-in driver combinations.</P>
<P>Most linux distributions now ship with a bunch of
small modules that are the various drivers.  The required
modules are typically loaded late in the boot process, or
on-demand as a driver is needed to access a particualr device.
You will need to attach this module to the kernel after it
has booted up. See the information that came with your
distribution on installing and using modules, along with
the module section in this document.
(
<A HREF="#modules">Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A>)</P>
<P>If you didn't find either a pre-built kernel with your driver,
or a module form of the driver, chances are you have a typically
uncommon card, and you will have to build your own kernel with
that driver included. Once you have linux installed, building a
custom kernel is not difficult at all. You essentially answer
yes or no to what you want the kernel to contain, and then tell
it to build it. There is a Kernel-HowTo that will help you along.</P>
<P>At this point you should have somehow managed to be booting a
kernel with your driver built in, or be loading it as a module.
About half of the problems people have are related to not having
driver loaded one way or another, so you may find things work now.</P>
<P>If it still doesn't work, then you need to verify that the
kernel is indeed detecting the card. To do this, you need
to type <CODE>dmesg | more</CODE> when  logged in after the
system has booted and all modules have been loaded.
This will allow you to review the boot messages that the
kernel scrolled up the screen during the boot process.
If the card has been detected, you should see somewhere in
that list a message from your card's driver that starts with
<CODE>eth0</CODE>, mentions the driver name and the hardware parameters
(interrupt setting, input/output port address, etc) that
the card is set for. (Note: At boot, linux lists
all the PCI cards installed in the system, regardless of
what drivers are available - do not mistake this for the
driver detection which comes later!)</P>
<P>If you don't see a driver indentification message like this,
then the driver didn't detect your card, and that is why things
aren't working. See the FAQ
(
<A HREF="#faq">The FAQ Section</A>) for what to do if
your card is not detected. If you have a NE2000 compatible,
there is also some NE2000 specific tips on getting a card
detected in the FAQ section as well.</P>
<P>If the card is detected, but the detection message reports
some sort of error, like a resource conflict, then the driver
probably won't have initialized properly and the card still
wont be useable. Most common error messages of this sort are
also listed in the FAQ section, along with a solution.</P>
<P>If the detection message seems okay, then double check the
card resources reported by the driver against those that
the card is physically set for (either by little black jumpers on the
card, or by a software utility supplied by the card manufacturer.)
These must match exactly. For example, if you have the card
jumpered or configured to IRQ 15 and the driver reports IRQ 10
in the boot messages, things will not work. The FAQ section
discusses the most common cases of drivers incorrectly detecting
the configuration information of various cards.</P>
<P>At this point, you have managed to get you card detected with
all the correct parameters, and hopefully everything is working.
If not, then you either have a software configuration error,
or a hardware configuration error. A software configuration
error is not setting up the right network addresses for the
<CODE>ifconfig</CODE> and <CODE>route</CODE> commands, and details of how
to do that are fully described in the Network HowTo and the
`Network Administrator's Guide' which both probably came on
the CD-ROM you installed from.</P>
<P>A hardware configuration error is when some sort of resource
conflict or mis-configuration (that the driver didn't detect
at boot) stops the card from working properly. This typically
can be observed in several different ways. (1) You get
an error message when <CODE>ifconfig</CODE> tries to open the device
for use, such as ``SIOCSFFLAGS: Try again''. (2) The driver
reports <CODE>eth0</CODE> error messages (viewed by <CODE>dmesg | more</CODE>)
or strange inconsistencies for each time it tries to send or
receive data. (3) Typing <CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE> shows
non-zero numbers in one of the errs, drop, fifo, frame or
carrier columns for <CODE>eth0</CODE>. (4) Typing 
<CODE>cat /proc/interrupts</CODE> shows a zero interrupt count
for the card.
Most of the typical hardware configuration errors are also
discussed in the FAQ section.</P>
<P>Well, if you have got to this point and things still
aren't working, read the FAQ section
of this document, read the vendor specific section detailing
your particular card, <EM>and if it still doesn't work</EM> then
you may have to resort to posting to an appropriate
newsgroup for help. If you do post, please detail all
relevant information in that post, such as the card brand,
the kernel version, the driver boot messages, the output
from <CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE>, a clear description of
the problem, and of course what you
have already tried to do in an effort to get things to work.</P>
<P>You would be surprised at how many people post useless things
like ``Can someone help me? My ethernet doesn't work.'' and
nothing else.
Readers of the newsgroups tend to ignore such silly posts,
whereas a detailed and informational problem description
may allow a `linux-guru' to spot your problem right away.
Of course the same holds true when e-mailing a problem
report - always provide as much information as possible.</P>


<H2><A NAME="cable-intro"></A> <A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Type of cable that your card should support</A>
</H2>


<P>The twisted pair cables, with the RJ-45 (giant phone jack)
connectors is technically called 10BaseT. You may also
hear it called UTP (Unsheilded Twisted Pair).</P>
<P>The thinnet, or thin ethernet cabling, (RG-58 coaxial cable)
with the BNC (metal push and turn-to-lock) connectors is
technically called 10Base2.</P>
<P>The older thick ethernet (10mm coaxial cable) which is only
found in older installations is called 10Base5. The 15 pin
D-shaped plug found on some ethernet cards (the AUI connector)
is used to connect to thick ethernet and external transcievers.</P>
<P>Most ethercards also come in a `Combo' version for only
$10-$20 more.
These have both twisted pair and thinnet transceiver built-in,
allowing you to change your mind later.</P>
<P>Most installations will use 10BaseT/100BaseT
10Base2 does not offer any upgrade path to 100Base-whatever.
10Base2 is fine for hobbyists setting up a home network
when purchasing a hub is not desireable for some reason
or another.</P>

<H2><A NAME="faq"></A> <A NAME="s2">2. Frequently Asked Questions</A></H2>


<P>Here are some of the more frequently asked questions about using
Linux with an Ethernet connection. Some of the more specific
questions are sorted on a `per manufacturer basis'.
Chances are the question you want an answer for has already
been asked (and answered!) by someone else, so even if you
don't find your answer here, you probably can find what you
want from a news archive such as
<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">Dejanews</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="what-driver"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How do I tell Linux what driver to use?</A>
</H2>


<P>With most Linux distributions, the drivers exist as loadable
modules, which are small binary files that are merged with
the operating system at run time. A module gives the
operating system (kernel) the information on how to control
that particular ethernet card.  The name of each module is
listed in the heading of the section for each card in this
document.  Once you know the name of the module, you have to
add it to the file <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> so Linux will
know what module to load for your card. The syntax is typically
as follows.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        alias eth0 module_name
        options module_name option1=value1 option2=value2 ...
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The options line is typically only needed for older ISA hardware.
For multiple card systems, additional lines with <CODE>eth1</CODE>,
<CODE>eth2</CODE> and so on are usually required.</P>
<P>The module files typically live in the directory 
<CODE>/lib/modules/</CODE> which is further subdivided by kernel
version (use <CODE>uname -r</CODE>) and subsystem (in this case
<CODE>net</CODE>).  These are put there by the distribution
builder, or by the individual user when they run
<CODE>make modules_install</CODE> after building their own
kernel and modules (see the kernel howto for more details
on building your own stuff).</P>
<P>If you build your own kernel, you have the option of having
all the drivers merged with the kernel right then and there,
rather than existing as separate files.  When this is done,
the drivers will detect the hardware at boot up.  Options
to the drivers are supplied by the kernel command line prior
to boot (see BootPrompt Howto for more details).  The user
chooses what drivers are used during the <CODE>make config</CODE>
step of building the kernel (again see the kernel howto).</P>


<H2><A NAME="what-card"></A> <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 What card should I buy for Linux?</A>
</H2>


<P>The answer to this question depends heavily on exactly what
you intend on doing with your net connection, and how much
traffic it will see.</P>
<P>If you only expect a single user to be doing the occasional
ftp session or WWW connection, then even an old ISA card
will probably keep you happy (assuming 10Mbps, not 100). </P>
<P>If you intend to set up a server, and you require the CPU
overhead of moving data over the network to be kept
to a minimum, you probably want to look at one of the
PCI cards that uses a chip with bus-mastering capapbility.
In addition, some cards now can actually do some of the
processing overhead of data checksums right on the card,
giving the CPU even more of a break.  For more details
please see:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/zerocopy.html">Hardware Checksum/Zerocopy Page</A></P>
<P>If you fall somewhere in the middle of the above, then any
one of the low cost PCI cards with a stable
driver will do the job for you.</P>

<H2><A NAME="alfa"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Alpha Drivers -- Getting and Using them</A>
</H2>


<P>I heard that there is an updated or preliminary/alpha driver
available for my card. Where can I get it?</P>
<P>The newest of the `new' drivers can be found on Donald's
WWW site: <CODE>www.scyld.com</CODE>  - things
change here quite frequently, so just look around for it.
Alternatively, it may be easier to use a WWW browser on:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.scyld.com/network/">Don's Linux Network Home Page</A></P>
<P>to locate the driver that you are looking for. (Watch out for
WWW browsers that silently munge the source by replacing
TABs with spaces and so on - use ftp, or at least an FTP URL
for downloading if unsure.)</P>
<P>Now, if it really is an alpha, or pre-alpha driver, then please
treat it as such. In other words, don't complain because you
can't figure out what to do with it. If you can't figure out
how to install it, then you probably shouldn't be testing it.
Also, if it brings your machine down, don't complain. Instead,
send us a well documented bug report, or even better, a patch!</P>
<P>Note that some of the `useable' experimental/alpha drivers have
been included in the standard kernel source tree. When running
<CODE>make config</CODE> one of the first things you will be asked
is whether to ``Prompt for development and/or incomplete
code/drivers''.  You will have to answer `Y' here to get
asked about including any alpha/experiemntal drivers.</P>

<H2><A NAME="two-card"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Using More than one Ethernet Card per Machine</A>
</H2>


<P>What needs to be done so that Linux can run two or more ethernet 
cards?</P>
<P>The answer to this question depends on whether the driver(s)
is/are being used as a loadable module or are compiled directly
into the kernel.  Most linux distributions use modular drivers now.
This saves distributing lots of kernels, each with a different driver
set built in. Instead a single basic kernel is used and the
individual drivers that are need for a particular user's system are
loaded once the system has booted far enough to access
the driver module files (usually stored in <CODE>/lib/modules/</CODE>).</P>
<P>In the case of PCI cards, the PCI drivers/modules should detect 
all of the installed cards that it supports automatically.  The
user should not supply any I/O base or IRQ information, unless
specifically instructed to do so by the individual driver
documentation in order to support some non-standard machine.</P>
<P>Some earlier kernels had a limit of 16 ethercards that could
be detected at boot, and some ISA modules have a limit of four
cards per loaded module. You can always load another copy of the
same module under a different name to support another four cards
if this is a limitation, or recompile the module with support
for as many as you require.</P>

<H3>With the Driver as a Module</H3>

<P>For ISA cards, probing for a card is not a safe operation, and
hence you typically need to supply the I/O base address of the
card so the module knows where to look. This information is
stored in the file <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>.</P>
<P>As an example, consider a user that has two ISA NE2000 cards,
one at <CODE>0x300</CODE> and one at <CODE>0x240</CODE> and what lines they
would have in their <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> file:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        alias eth0 ne
        alias eth1 ne
        options ne io=0x240,0x300
</PRE>
</P>
<P>What this does: This says that if the administrator (or the
kernel) does a <CODE>modprobe eth0</CODE> or a <CODE>modprobe eth1</CODE> then
the <CODE>ne.o</CODE> driver should be loaded for either <CODE>eth0</CODE> or
<CODE>eth1</CODE>.  Furthermore, when the <CODE>ne.o</CODE> module is loaded, it
should be loaded with the options <CODE>io=0x240,0x300</CODE> so that the
driver knows where to look for the cards. Note that the <CODE>0x</CODE>
is important - things like <CODE>300h</CODE> as commonly used in the DOS
world won't work.  Switching the order of the <CODE>0x240</CODE> and
the <CODE>0x300</CODE> will switch which physical card ends up as
<CODE>eth0</CODE> and <CODE>eth1</CODE>.</P>
<P>Most of the ISA module drivers can take multiple comma separated
I/O values like this example to handle multiple cards.  However,
some (older?) drivers, such as the 3c501.o module are currently
only able to handle
one card per module load. In this case you can load the module
twice to get both cards detected. The <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>
file in this case would look like:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        alias eth0 3c501
        alias eth1 3c501
        options eth0 -o 3c501-0 io=0x280 irq=5
        options eth1 -o 3c501-1 io=0x300 irq=7
</PRE>
</P>
<P>In this example the <CODE>-o</CODE> option has been used to give each
instance of the module a unique name, since you can't have two
modules loaded with the same name.  The <CODE>irq=</CODE> option has
also been used to to specify the hardware IRQ setting of the card.
(This method can also be used with modules that accept comma
separated I/O values, but it is less efficient since the module
ends up being loaded twice when it doesn't really need to be.)</P>
<P>As a final example, consider a user with one 3c503 card
at <CODE>0x350</CODE> and one SMC Elite16 (wd8013) card at <CODE>0x280</CODE>.
They would have:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        alias eth0 wd
        alias eth1 3c503
        options wd io=0x280
        options 3c503 io=0x350
</PRE>
</P>
<P>For PCI cards, you typically only need the <CODE>alias</CODE> lines to
correlate the <CODE>ethN</CODE> interfaces with the appropriate driver
name, since the I/O base of a PCI card can be safely detected.</P>
<P>The available modules are typically stored in
<CODE>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/net</CODE> where the
<CODE>uname -r</CODE> command gives the kernel version (e.g. 2.0.34).
You can look in there to see which one matches your card.
Once you have the correct settings in your <CODE>modules.conf</CODE>
file, you can test things out with:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        modprobe eth0
        modprobe eth1
           ...
        modprobe ethN-1
</PRE>
</P>
<P>where `N' is the number of ethernet interfaces you have.
Note that the interface name (<CODE>ethX</CODE>) assigned to the driver
by the kernel is independent of the name used on the alias line.
For further details on this, see:
<A HREF="#modules">Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A></P>


<H3>With the Driver Compiled into the Kernel</H3>

<P>Since some ISA card probes can hang the machine, kernels
up to and including 2.4 only autoprobe for 
<EM>one</EM> ISA ethercard by default. As there aren't
any distribution kernels with lots of ISA drivers built
in anymore, this restriction is no longer in 2.6 and newer.</P>
<P>As of 2.2 and newer kernels, the boot probes have been
sorted into safe and unsafe, so that all safe (e.g. PCI and
EISA) probes will find all related cards automatically. Systems
with more than one ethernet card with at least one of them
being an ISA card will still need to do one of the following.)</P>
<P>There are two ways that you can enable auto-probing for
the second (and third, and...) card. The easiest
method is to pass boot-time arguments to the kernel,
which is usually done by LILO. Probing for the
second card can be achieved by using a boot-time argument
as simple as <CODE>ether=0,0,eth1</CODE>. In this
case <CODE>eth0</CODE> and <CODE>eth1</CODE> will be assigned in the order
that the cards are found at boot.  Say if you want
the card at <CODE>0x300</CODE> to be <CODE>eth0</CODE> and
the card at <CODE>0x280</CODE> to be <CODE>eth1</CODE> then you could use</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
LILO: linux ether=5,0x300,eth0 ether=15,0x280,eth1
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>ether=</CODE> command accepts more than the IRQ + I/O
+ name shown above. Please have a look at

<P>The second way (not recommended) is to edit the file
<CODE>Space.c</CODE> and replace the <CODE>0xffe0</CODE> entry for the
I/O address with a zero. The <CODE>0xffe0</CODE> entry tells it
not to probe for that device -- replacing it with a zero

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 The <CODE>ether=</CODE> thing didn't do anything for me. Why?</A>
</H2>


<P>As described above, the <CODE>ether=</CODE> command <EM>only</EM> works
for drivers that are compiled into the kernel. Now most
distributions use the drivers in a modular form, and so
the <CODE>ether=</CODE> command is rarely used anymore. (Some older
documentation has yet to be updated to reflect this change.)
If you want to apply options for a modular ethernet driver
you <EM>must</EM> make changes to the <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>
file.</P>
<P>If you <EM>are</EM> using a compiled in driver, and have added
an <CODE>ether=</CODE> to your LILO configuration file, note
that it won't take effect until you re-run <CODE>lilo</CODE>
to process the updated configuration file.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ne2k-probs"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Problems with NE1000 / NE2000 cards (and clones)</A>
</H2>


<P><B>Problem:</B>
PCI NE2000 clone card is not detected at boot with v2.0.x.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
The <CODE>ne.c</CODE> driver up to v2.0.30 only knows about the PCI
ID number of RealTek 8029 based clone cards. Since then,
several others have also released PCI NE2000 clone
cards, with different PCI ID numbers, and hence the
driver doesn't detect them.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
The easiest solution is to upgrade to a v2.0.31 (or newer)
version of the
linux kernel. It knows the ID numbers of about five different
NE2000-PCI chips, and will detect them automatically at boot or
at module loading time. If you upgrade to 2.0.34 (or newer)
there is a PCI-only specific NE2000 driver that is slightly
smaller and more efficient than the original ISA/PCI driver.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
PCI NE2000 clone card is reported as an ne1000 (8 bit card!)
at boot or when I load the ne.o module for v2.0.x, and hence
doesn't work.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
Some PCI clones don't implement byte wide access (and hence are
not truly 100% NE2000 compatible). This causes the probe
to think they are NE1000 cards.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
You need to upgrade to v2.0.31 (or newer) as described above.
The driver(s) now check for this hardware bug.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
PCI NE2000 card gets terrible performance, even when reducing the
window size as described in the Performance Tips section.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
The spec sheets for the original 8390 chip,  desgined and sold  
over ten years ago, noted that a dummy read from the chip was
required before each write operation for maximum reliablity.
The driver has the facility to do this but it has been disabled
by default since the v1.2 kernel days.  One user has reported that
re-enabling this `mis-feature' helped their performance with a
cheap PCI NE2000 clone card.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Since it has only been reported as a solution by one person, don't
get your hopes up. Re-enabling the read before write fix is done
by simply editing the driver file in <CODE>linux/drivers/net/</CODE>,
uncommenting the line containing <CODE>NE_RW_BUGFIX</CODE> and then
rebuilding the kernel or module as appropriate. Please send an
e-mail describing the performance difference and type of card/chip
you have if this helps you. (The same can be done for the
<CODE>ne2k-pci.c</CODE> driver as well).</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
The <CODE>ne2k-pci.c</CODE> driver reports error messages like
<CODE>timeout waiting for Tx RDC</CODE> with a PCI NE2000 card and doesn't
work right.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
Your card and/or the card to PCI bus link can't handle the long
word I/O optimization used in this driver.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Firstly, check the settings available in the BIOS/CMOS setup
to see if any related to PCI bus timing are too aggressive for
reliable operation. Otherwise using the ISA/PCI <CODE>ne.c</CODE>
driver (or removing the <CODE>#define USE_LONGIO</CODE> from
<CODE>ne2k-pci.c</CODE>) should let you use the card.</P>
<P><B>Probem:</B>
ISA Plug and Play NE2000 (such as RealTek 8019) is not detected.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
The original NE2000 specification (and hence the linux NE2000 driver
in older kernels) did not have support for Plug and Play.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Either use a 2.4 or newer kernel that has a NE2000 driver with PnP,
or use the DOS configuration disk that came with the card to disable
PnP, and to set the card to a specified I/O address and IRQ. Add
a line to <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>  like <CODE>options ne io=0xNNN</CODE>
where <CODE>0xNNN</CODE> is the hex I/O address you set the card to. (This
assumes you are using a modular driver; if not then use an
<CODE>ether=0,0xNNN,eth0</CODE> argument at boot).  You may also have to 
enter the BIOS/CMOS setup and mark the IRQ as Legacy-ISA instead of
PnP. </P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
NE*000 driver reports `not found (no reset ack)' during boot
probe.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
This is related to the above change. After the initial
verification that an 8390 is at the probed I/O address, the
reset is performed. When the card has completed the reset,
it is supposed to acknowedge that the reset has completed.
Your card doesn't, and so the driver assumes that no NE card
is present.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
You can tell the driver that you have a bad card by using
an otherwise unused <CODE>mem_end</CODE> hexidecimal value of <CODE>0xbad</CODE> at
boot time. You <EM>have</EM> to also supply a non-zero I/O base
for the card when using the <CODE>0xbad</CODE> override. For example,
a card that is at <CODE>0x340</CODE> that doesn't ack the reset
would use something like:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
LILO: linux ether=0,0x340,0,0xbad,eth0
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>This will allow the card detection to continue, even if your
card doesn't ACK the reset. If you are using the driver as
a module, then you can supply the option <CODE>bad=0xbad</CODE> just
like you supply the I/O address. </P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
NE*000 card hangs machine at first network access.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
This problem has been reported for kernels as old as 1.1.57
to the present. It appears confined to a few software configurable
clone cards. It appears that they expect to be initialized in
some special way.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Several people have reported that running the supplied DOS
software config program and/or the supplied DOS driver prior
to warm booting (i.e. loadlin or the `three-finger-salute')
into linux allowed the card to work. This would indicate
that these cards need to be initialized in a particular
fashion, slightly different than what the present Linux
driver does.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
NE*000 ethercard at <CODE>0x360</CODE> doesn't get detected.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
Your NE2000 card is <CODE>0x20</CODE> wide in
I/O space, which makes it hit the parallel port at <CODE>0x378</CODE>.
Other devices that could be there are the second floppy
controller (if equipped) at <CODE>0x370</CODE> and the secondary
IDE controller at <CODE>0x376--0x377</CODE>.
If the port(s) are already registered by another driver, the
kernel will not let the probe happen.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Either move your card to an address like <CODE>0x280, 0x340, 0x320</CODE>
or compile without parallel printer support.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
Network `goes away' every time I print something (NE2000)</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
Same problem as above, but you have an older kernel that
doesn't check for overlapping I/O regions. Use the
same fix as above, and get a new kernel while you are at it.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
NE*000 ethercard probe at 0xNNN: 00 00 C5 ... not found.
(invalid signature yy zz)</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
First off, do you have a NE1000 or NE2000 card at the addr. 0xNNN?
And if so, does the hardware address reported look like a valid
one? If so, then you have a poor NE*000 clone. All NE*000 clones
are supposed to have the value <CODE>0x57</CODE> in bytes 14 and 15 of the
SA PROM on the card. Yours doesn't -- it has `yy zz' instead.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
There are two ways to get around this. The easiest is to
use an <CODE>0xbad</CODE> mem_end value as described above for the
`no reset ack' problem. This will bypass the signature check,
as long as a non-zero I/O base is also given. This way no
recompilation of the kernel is required.</P>
<P>The second method (for hackers) involves changing the driver
itself, and then recompiling your kernel (or module).
The driver (/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ne.c) has a "Hall of Shame"
list at about line 42. This list is used to detect poor clones.
For example, the DFI cards use `DFI' in the first 3 bytes of the
PROM, instead of using <CODE>0x57</CODE> in bytes 14 and 15, like they are
supposed to.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
The machine hangs during boot right after the `8390...'  or
`WD....' message. Removing the NE2000 fixes the problem.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Change your NE2000 base address to something like <CODE>0x340</CODE>.
Alternatively, you
can use the ``reserve='' boot argument in conjunction with
the ``ether='' argument to protect the card from other
device driver probes.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
Your NE2000 clone isn't a good enough clone. An active
NE2000 is a bottomless pit that will trap any driver
autoprobing in its space.
Changing the NE2000 to a less-popular
address will move it out of the way of other autoprobes,
allowing your machine to boot.</P>

<P><B>Problem:</B>
The machine hangs during the SCSI probe at boot.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
It's the same problem as above, change the
ethercard's address, or use the reserve/ether boot arguments.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
The machine hangs during the soundcard probe at boot.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
No, that's really during the silent SCSI probe, and it's
the same problem as above.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
NE2000 not detected at boot - no boot messages at all</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
There is no `magic solution' as there can be a number of
reasons why it wasn't detected. The following list should
help you walk through the possible problems.</P>
<P>1) Build a new kernel with only the device drivers that you need.
Verify that you are indeed booting the fresh kernel. Forgetting to
run lilo, etc. can result in booting the old one. (Look closely at
the build time/date reported at boot.) Sounds obvious, but we have
all done it before. Make sure the driver is in fact included in
the new kernel, by checking the <CODE>System.map</CODE> file for names
like <CODE>ne_probe</CODE>.</P>
<P>2) Look at the boot messages carefully. Does it ever even mention
doing a ne2k probe such
as `NE*000 probe at 0xNNN: not found (blah blah)'
or does it just fail silently. There is a big difference.
Use <CODE>dmesg|more</CODE>
to review the boot messages after logging in, or hit Shift-PgUp
to scroll the screen up after the boot has completed and the login
prompt appears.</P>
<P>3) After booting, do a <CODE>cat /proc/ioports</CODE> and verify
that the full iospace that the card will require is vacant. If
you are at <CODE>0x300</CODE> then the ne2k driver will ask
for <CODE>0x300-0x31f</CODE>. If any other device driver has registered
even one port anywhere in that range, the probe will not
take place at that address and will silently continue to the next
of the probed addresses. A common case is having the lp driver
reserve <CODE>0x378</CODE> or the second IDE channel reserve <CODE>0x376</CODE>
which stops the ne driver from probing <CODE>0x360-0x380</CODE>.</P>
<P>4) Same as above for <CODE>cat /proc/interrupts</CODE>. Make sure no
other device has registered the interrupt that you set
the ethercard for. In this case, the probe will happen, and the
ether driver will complain loudly at boot about not being able to
get the desired IRQ line.</P>
<P>5) If you are still stumped by the silent failure of the driver, then
edit it and add some printk() to the probe. For example, with the ne2k
you could add/remove lines (marked with a `+' or `-') in
<CODE>linux/drivers/net/ne.c</CODE> like:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
    int reg0 = inb_p(ioaddr);

+    printk("NE2k probe - now checking %x\n",ioaddr);
-    if (reg0 == 0xFF)
+    if (reg0 == 0xFF) {
+       printk("NE2k probe - got 0xFF (vacant I/O port)\n");
        return ENODEV;
+    }
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Then it will output messages for each port address that it checks,
and you will see if your card's address is being probed or not.</P>
<P>6) You can also get the ne2k diagnostic from Don's ftp site (mentioned
in the howto as well) and see if it is able to detect your card after
you have booted into linux. Use the `<CODE>-p 0xNNN</CODE>' option to tell it
where to look for the card. (The default is <CODE>0x300</CODE> and it doesn't
go looking elsewhere, unlike the boot-time probe.)
The output from when it finds a card will look something like:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
Checking the ethercard at 0x300.
  Register 0x0d (0x30d) is 00

<HR>
</P>
<P>Your register values and PROM values will probably be different.
Note that all the PROM values are doubled for a 16 bit card, and
that the ethernet address (00:00:c0:b0:05:65) appears in the
first row, and the double <CODE>0x57</CODE> signature appears at the
end of the PROM.</P>
<P>The output from when there is no card installed at <CODE>0x300</CODE>
will look something like this:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
Checking the ethercard at 0x300.
  Register 0x0d (0x30d) is ff
  Failed initial NE2000 probe, value ff.

SA PROM 0x10: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

 Invalid signature found, wordlength 2.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>0xff</CODE> values  arise because that is the value that
is returned when one reads a vacant I/O port. If you happen
to have some other hardware in the region that is probed, you
may see some non <CODE>0xff</CODE> values as well.</P>
<P>7) Try warm booting into linux from a DOS boot floppy (via loadlin)
after running the supplied DOS driver or config program. It may be doing
some extra (i.e. non-standard) "magic" to initialize the card.</P>
<P>8) Try Russ Nelson's ne2000.com packet driver to see if even it can
see your card -- if not, then things do not look good. Example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
A:> ne2000 0x60 10 0x300
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The arguments are software interrupt vector, hardware IRQ,
and  I/O base.  You can get it from any msdos archive in
pktdrv11.zip -- The current version may be newer than 11.</P>



<H2><A NAME="8013-probs"></A> <A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Problems with SMC Ultra/EtherEZ and WD80*3 cards</A>
</H2>


<P><B>Problem:</B>
You get messages such as the following:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        eth0: bogus packet size: 65531, status=0xff, nxpg=0xff
</PRE>
</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
There is a shared memory problem.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
The most common reason for this is PCI machines that are
not configured to map in ISA memory devices. Hence you
end up reading the PC's RAM (all <CODE>0xff</CODE> values) instead of
the RAM on the card that contains the data from the
received packet.</P>
<P>Other typical problems that are easy to fix are board conflicts,
having cache or `shadow ROM' enabled for that region, or
running your ISA bus faster than 8Mhz. There are also a
surprising number of memory failures on ethernet cards,
so run a diagnostic program if you have one for your
ethercard.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
SMC EtherEZ doesn't work in non-shared memory (PIO) mode.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
Older versions of the Ultra driver only supported the card
in the shared memory mode of operation.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
The driver in kernel version 2.0 and above also supports the
programmed I/O mode of operation. Upgrade to v2.0 or newer.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
Old wd8003 and/or jumper-settable wd8013 always get the IRQ wrong.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
The old wd8003 cards and jumper-settable wd8013 clones don't
have the EEPROM that the driver can read the IRQ setting from.
If the driver can't read the IRQ, then it tries to auto-IRQ
to find out what it is. And if auto-IRQ returns zero, then
the driver just assigns IRQ 5 for an 8 bit card or IRQ 10 for
a 16 bit card.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Avoid the auto-IRQ code, and tell the kernel what the IRQ
that you have jumpered the card to in your module configuration
file (or via a boot time argument for in-kernel drivers).</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
SMC Ultra card is detected as wd8013, but the IRQ and shared
memory base is wrong.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
The Ultra card looks a lot like a wd8013, and if the Ultra
driver is not present in the kernel, the wd driver may
mistake the ultra as a wd8013. The ultra probe comes before the
wd probe, so this usually shouldn't happen. The ultra stores
the IRQ and mem base in the EEPROM differently than a wd8013,
hence the bogus values reported.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Recompile with only the drivers you need in the kernel. If you
have a mix of wd and ultra cards in one machine, and are using
modules, then load the ultra module first.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3com-probs"></A> <A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 Problems with 3Com cards</A>
</H2>

<P><B>Problem:</B>
The 3c503 picks IRQ N, but this is needed for some
other device which needs IRQ N. (eg. CD ROM driver, modem, etc.)
Can this be fixed without compiling this into the kernel?</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
The 3c503 driver probes for a free IRQ line in the order
{5, 9/2, 3, 4}, and it should pick a line which isn't being
used. The driver chooses when
the card is <CODE>ifconfig</CODE>'ed into operation.</P>
<P>If you are using a modular driver, you can use module
parameters to set various things, including the IRQ value.</P>
<P>The following selects IRQ9, base
location <CODE>0x300</CODE>, &lt;ignored value&gt;, and if_port #1 (the

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>Alternately, if the driver is compiled into the kernel,
you can set the same values at boot by passing

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
3c503: configured interrupt X invalid, will use autoIRQ.</P>
<P><B>Reason:</B>
The 3c503 card can only use one of IRQ{5, 2/9, 3, 4}
(These are the only lines that are connected to the card.)
If you pass in an IRQ value that is not in the above
set, you will get the above message.
Usually, specifying an interrupt value for the 3c503 is
not necessary. The 3c503 will autoIRQ when it gets
ifconfig'ed, and pick one of IRQ{5, 2/9, 3, 4}.</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
Use one of the valid IRQs listed above, or enable
autoIRQ by not specifying the IRQ line at all.</P>
<P><B>Problem:</B>
The supplied 3c503 drivers don't use the AUI (thicknet) port.
How does one choose it over the default thinnet port?</P>
<P><B>Solution:</B>
The 3c503 AUI port can be selected at boot-time for in-kernel
drivers, and at module insertion for modular drivers.
The selection is overloaded onto the low bit of
the currently-unused dev-&gt;rmem_start variable, so a boot-time
parameter of:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.9">2.9 FAQs Not Specific to Any Card.</A>
</H2>



<H3>Linux and ISA Plug and Play Ethernet Cards</H3>


<P>For best results (and minimum aggravation) it is recommended
that you use the (usually DOS) program that came with your
card to disable the ISA-PnP mechanism and set it to a fixed
I/O address and IRQ.  Make sure the I/O address you use is
probed by the driver at boot, or if using modules then supply
the address as an <CODE>io=</CODE> option in <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>.
You may also have to enter the BIOS/CMOS setup and mark the IRQ 
as Legacy-ISA instead of ISA-PnP (if your computer has this option). </P>
<P>Note that you typically don't need DOS installed to run a
DOS based configuration program. You can usually just boot
a DOS floppy disk and run them from the supplied floppy disk.
You can also download OpenDOS and FreeDOS for free.</P>
<P>If you require ISA-PnP enabled for compatibility with some other
operating system then what you will have to do depends
on what kernel version you are using. For 2.2.x and older
kernels, you will have to use the isapnptools
package with linux to configure the card(s) each time at boot.
You will still have to make sure the I/O address chosen for the
card is probed by the driver or supplied as an <CODE>io=</CODE> option.
For 2.4.x and newer kernels, there is ISA-PnP support available
built right into the kernel (if selected at build time) and
if your particular driver makes use of this support, then your
card will be configured to an available I/O address and IRQ
all without any user supplied option values.  You do <EM>not</EM>
want to be trying to use the user-space isapnptools and the
in kernel ISA-PnP support at the same time.</P>
<P>Some systems have an `enable PnP OS' (or similar named) 
option in the BIOS/CMOS  setup menu which does not really
have anything to do with ISA-PnP hardware.
See below for more details on this option.</P>

<H3>PCI machine detects card but driver fails probe (PnP OS).</H3>


<P>Some PCI BIOSes may not enable all PCI cards at power-up,
especially if the BIOS option `PnP OS' is enabled. This
mis-feature is to support the current release of Windows which
still uses some real-mode drivers. Either disable this option,
or try and upgrade to a newer driver which has the code to
enable a disabled card.</P>
<P>Note that kernel version 2.4.x has better support to deal
with this option - in particular you should be able to 
enable this option, and the kernel/drivers should be able
to set up and/or enable the cards on its own.</P>

<H3>All cards detected but two fail to work in PCI machine</H3>


<P>Version 1 of the PCI spec allowed for some slots to be
bus master and some slots to be slave (non-bus master) slots.
To avoid the problems associated with people putting BM
cards into slave slots, the v2 of the PCI spec said that all
slots should be BM capable.  Hovever most PCI chipsets only
have four BM pins, and so if you have a five slot board,
chances are that two slots share one of the BM pins! This allows
the board to meet the requirements of the v2 spec (but not
the intent).  So if you have a bunch of cards, and two of
them fail to work, they may be in slots that share a BM pin.</P>

<H3>I have <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE> and not <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>.</H3>


<P>Older distributions will have <CODE>conf.modules</CODE> and not
<CODE>modules.conf</CODE> which is the more sensible name of
the two.  Newer module utility programs expect the new name,
so keep that in mind if you upgrade an older system.</P>

<H3>Ethercard is Not Detected at Boot.</H3>


<P>The usual reason for this is that people are using a kernel
that does not have support for their particular card built
in. For a modular kernel, it usually means that the required
module has not been requested for loading.</P>
<P>If you are using a modular based kernel, such as those installed
by most of the linux distributions, then try and use the
configuration utility for the distribution to select the module
for your card. For ISA cards, it is a good idea to determine
the I/O address of the card and add it as an
option (e.g. <CODE>io=0x340</CODE>) if the configuration utility asks
for any options. If there is no configuration utility, then
you will have to add the correct module name (and options)
to <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> -- see <CODE>man modprobe</CODE> for
more details.</P>
<P>The next main cause is having another device using part
of the I/O space that your card needs. Most cards are
16 or 32 bytes wide in I/O space. If your card is set
at <CODE>0x300</CODE> and 32 bytes wide, then the driver will ask
for <CODE>0x300-0x31f</CODE>. If any other device driver has registered
even one port anywhere in that range, the probe will not
take place at that address and  the driver will silently
continue to the next of the probed addresses. So, after
booting, do a <CODE>cat /proc/ioports</CODE> and verify that the
full I/O space that the card will require is vacant.</P>
<P>Another problem is having your card jumpered to an I/O
address that isn't probed by default.  The list of 
probed addresses for each driver is easily found just
after the text comments in the driver source.
Even if the I/O setting of your card is
not in the list of probed addresses, you can supply
it at boot (for in-kernel drivers) with
the <CODE>ether=</CODE> command as described in
<A HREF="#lilo">Passing Ethernet Arguments...</A>
Modular drivers can make use of the <CODE>io=</CODE> option 
in <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> to
specify an address that isn't probed by default.</P>


<H3>Driver reports <CODE>unresolved symbol ei_open</CODE> and won't load.</H3>


<P>You are using one of the many ethernet cards that have
an 8390 chip (or clone) on board.  For such cards, the
driver comes in two parts - the part which you unsuccessfully
tried to load (e.g. <CODE>ne2k-pci.o, ne.o, wd.o, smc-ultra.o</CODE>
etc.) and the 8390 part.  These drivers have <EM>(+8390)</EM>
listed right beside their module name in the vendor
specific information listing.
(
<A HREF="#card-intro">Vendor Specific...</A>)</P>
<P>You have to make sure that the
<CODE>8390.o</CODE> module gets loaded <EM>before</EM> loading the
second half of the driver so that the second half of the
driver can find the functions in <CODE>8390.o</CODE> that it needs.</P>
<P>Possible causes: (1)Forgetting to run depmod after installing
a new kernel and modules, so that module dependencies like
this are handled automatically. (2)Using <CODE>insmod</CODE> instead
of <CODE>modprobe</CODE>, as insmod doesn't check for any module
ordering constraints. (3)The module <CODE>8390.o</CODE> is not
in the directory beside the other half of the driver where
it should be.</P>

<H3><CODE>ifconfig</CODE> reports the wrong I/O address for the card.</H3>


<P>No it doesn't. You are just interpreting it incorrectly.
This is <EM>not</EM> a bug, and the numbers reported are correct. It just
happens that some 8390 based cards (wd80x3, smc-ultra, etc) have the
actual 8390 chip living at an offset from the first assigned I/O port.
This is the value stored in
<CODE>dev->base_addr</CODE>, and is what <CODE>ifconfig</CODE> reports. If you
want to see the full range of ports that your card uses, then try
<CODE>cat /proc/ioports</CODE> which will give the numbers you expect.</P>

<H3>Shared Memory ISA cards in PCI Machine do not work (<CODE>0xffff</CODE>)</H3>


<P>This will usually show up as reads of lots of <CODE>0xffff</CODE> values.
No shared memory cards of any type will work in a PCI machine
unless you have the PCI ROM BIOS/CMOS SETUP configuration set
properly. You have to set it to allow shared memory access
from the ISA bus for the memory region that your card is trying
to use. If you can't figure out which settings are applicable
then ask your supplier or local computer guru. For AMI BIOS,
there is usually a "Plug and Play" section where there will
be an ``ISA Shared Memory Size'' and ``ISA Shared Memory Base''
settings. For cards like the wd8013 and SMC Ultra, change the
size from the default of `Disabled' to 16kB, and change the base
to the shared memory address of your card.</P>


<H3>Card seems to send data but never receives anything.</H3>


<P>Do a <CODE>cat /proc/interrupts</CODE>.
A running total of the number of interrupt events your
card generates will be in the list given from the above.
If it is zero and/or doesn't increase when you try to use
the card then there is probably a physical interrupt 
conflict with another device installed in the computer
(regardless of whether or not the other device has a 
driver installed/available).
Change the IRQ of one of the two devices to a free IRQ.</P>


<H3>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Support</H3>


<P>Werner Almesberger has been working on ATM support

and the Zeitnet ZN1221 board
(
<A HREF="http://www.zeitnet.com/">Zeitnet</A>).</P>

stable, while the driver for the ZN1221 is presently
unfinished.</P>

<H3>Gigabit Ethernet Support</H3>


<P>Is there any gigabit ethernet support for Linux?</P>
<P>Yes, there are currently several. One of the prominent
Linux network developers rated the performance of the
cards with linux drivers as follows: 1) Intel E1000,
2) Tigon2/Acenic, 3) SysKonnect sk-98xx, 4) Tigon3/bcm57xx.
This was as of March 2002 and subject to change of course.</P>

<H3>FDDI Support</H3>

<P>Is there FDDI support for Linux?</P>
<P>Yes. Larry Stefani has written
a driver for v2.0 with Digital's DEFEA (FDDI EISA)
and DEFPA (FDDI PCI) cards.
This was included into the v2.0.24 kernel.  Currently
no other cards are supported though.</P>

<H3>Full Duplex Support</H3>


<P>Will Full Duplex give me 20MBps? Does Linux support it?</P>
<P>Cameron Spitzer writes the following about full duplex 10Base-T
cards: ``If you connect it to a full duplex switched hub,
and your system is fast enough and not doing much else, it can
keep the link busy in both directions.
There is no such thing as full duplex 10BASE-2 or 10BASE-5
(thin and thick coax).
Full Duplex works by disabling collision detection in the adapter.
That's why you can't do it with coax; the LAN won't run that way.
10BASE-T (RJ45 interface) uses separate wires for send and receive,
so it's possible to run both ways at the same time.  The switching
hub takes care of the collision problem.  The signalling rate
is 10 Mbps.''</P>
<P>So as you can see, you still will only be able to receive or
transmit at 10Mbps, and hence don't expect a 2x performance
increase. As to whether it is supported or not, that depends
on the card and possibly the driver. Some cards may do
auto-negotiation, some may need driver support, and some may
need the user to select an option in a card's EEPROM configuration.
Only the serious/heavy user would notice the difference between
the two modes anyway.</P>

<H3>Ethernet Cards for Linux on SMP Machines</H3>


<P>If you spent the extra money on a multi processor (MP) computer then
buy a good ethernet card as well. For v2.0 kernels it wasn't really
an issue, but it definitely is for v2.2. Most of the older
non-intelligent (e.g. ISA bus PIO and shared memory design) cards
were never designed with any consideration for use on a MP machine.
The executive summary is to buy an intelligent modern design
card and make sure the driver has been written (or updated) to
handle MP operation.  (The key words here are `modern design'  - the
PCI-NE2000's are just a 10+ year old design on a modern bus.)
Looking for the text <CODE>spin_lock</CODE> in the driver source is a good
indication that the driver has been written to deal with MP operation.
The full details of why you should buy a good card for MP use (and
what happens if you dont) follow.</P>
<P>In v2.0 kernels, only one processor was allowed `in kernel'  
(i.e. changing kernel data and/or running device drivers) at any
given time. So from the point of view of the card (and the associated
driver) nothing was different from uni processor (UP) operation and
things just continued to work. (This was the easiest way to get a
working MP version of Linux - one big lock around the whole kernel
only allows one processor in at a time. This way you know that you
won't have two processors trying to change the same thing at the
same time!)</P>
<P>The downside to only allowing one processor in
the kernel at a time was that you only got MP performance
if the running programs were self contained and calculation intensive.
If the programs did a lot of input/output (I/O) such as reading or
writing data to disk or over a network, then all but one of the
processors would be stalled waiting on their I/O requests to be
completed while the one processor running in kernel frantically
tries to run all the device drivers to fill the I/O requests. The
kernel becomes the bottleneck and since there is only one processor
running in the kernel, the performance of a MP machine in the heavy
I/O, single-lock case quickly degrades close to that of a single 
processor machine.</P>
<P>Since this is clearly less than ideal (esp. for file/WWW servers,
routers, etc.) the v2.2 kernels have finer grained locking - meaning
that more than one processor can be in the kernel at a time. Instead
of one big lock around the whole kernel, there are a lot of smaller
locks protecting critical data from being manipulated by more than
one processor at a time - e.g. one processor can be running the
driver for the network card, while another processor
is running the driver for the disk drive at the same time.</P>
<P>Okay, with that all in mind here are the snags:  The finer locking
means that you can have one processor trying to send data
out through an ethernet driver while another processor tries to
access the same driver/card to do something else (such as get the
card statistics for <CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE>). Oops - your card
stats just got sent out over the wire, while you got data for
your stats instead. Yes, the card got confused by being asked
to do two (or more!) things at once, and chances are it crashed
your machine in the process.</P>
<P>So, the driver that worked for UP is
no longer good enough - it needs to be updated with locks  that
control access to the underlying card so that the three tasks of
receive, transmit and manipulation
of configuration data are serialized to
the degree required by the card for stable operation. The scary
part here is that a driver not yet updated with locks for stable
MP operation will probably appear to be working in a MP machine
under light network load, but will crash the machine or at least
exhibit strange behaviour when two (or more!) processors try to
do more than one of these three tasks at the same time.</P>
<P>The updated MP aware ethernet driver will (at a
minimum) require a lock
around the driver that limits access at the entry points
from the kernel into the driver to `one at a time please'.
With this in place, things will be serialized so that the
underlying hardware should be treated just as if it was being
used in a UP machine, and so it should be stable. The downside
is that the one lock around the whole ethernet driver has
the same negative performance implications that having one big
lock around the whole kernel had (but on a smaller scale) - i.e.
you can only have one processor dealing with the card
at a time.
[Technical Note: The performance impact may also include
increased interrupt latencies if the locks that need to be
added are of the <CODE>irqsave</CODE> type and they are held
for a long time.]</P>
<P>Possible improvements on this situation can be made in two
ways. You can try to minimize the time between when the lock is
taken and when it is released, and/or you can implement finer
grained locking within the driver (e.g. a lock around the whole
driver would be overkill if a lock or two protecting against
simultaneous access to a couple of sensitive registers/settings
on the card would suffice).</P>
<P>However, for older non-intelligent
cards that were never designed with MP use in mind, neither of
these improvements may be feasible. Worse yet is that the
non-intelligent cards typically require the processor to move
the data between the card and the computer memory, so in a
worst case scenario the lock will be held the whole time that
it takes to move each 1.5kB data packet over an ISA bus.</P>
<P>The more modern intelligent cards typically move network data
directly to and from the computer memory without any help from
a processor.  This is a big win, since the lock is then only
held for the short time it takes the processor to tell the card
where in memory to get/store the next network data packet. More
modern card designs are less apt to require a single big
lock around the whole driver as well.</P>



<H3>Ethernet Cards for Linux on Alpha/AXP PCI Boards</H3>


<P>As of v2.0, only the 3c509, depca, de4x5, pcnet32, and all the
8390 drivers (wd, smc-ultra, ne, 3c503, etc.) have
been made `architecture independent' so as to work on the
DEC Alpha CPU based systems.  Other updated PCI drivers from
Donald's WWW page may also work as these have been written
with architecture independence in mind.</P>
<P>Note that the changes that are required to make a driver
architecture independent aren't that complicated.
You only need to do the following:</P>
<P>-multiply all <CODE>jiffies</CODE> related values by HZ/100 to account
for the different HZ value that the Alpha uses.
(i.e <CODE>timeout=2;</CODE> becomes <CODE>timeout=2*HZ/100;</CODE>)</P>
<P>-replace any I/O memory (640k to 1MB) pointer dereferences with
the appropriate readb() writeb() readl() writel() calls, as
shown in this example.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
-       int *mem_base = (int *)dev->mem_start;
-       mem_base[0] = 0xba5eba5e;
+       unsigned long mem_base = dev->mem_start;
+       writel(0xba5eba5e, mem_base);
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>-replace all memcpy() calls that have I/O memory as source or
target destinations with the appropriate one of
<CODE>memcpy_fromio()</CODE> or <CODE>memcpy_toio()</CODE>.</P>
<P>Details on handling memory accesses in an architecture
independent fashion are documented in the file
<CODE>linux/Documentation/IO-mapping.txt</CODE> that comes
with recent kernels.</P>

<H3>Ethernet for Linux on SUN/Sparc Hardware.</H3>

<P>For the most up to date information on Sparc stuff, try the
following URL:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.geog.ubc.ca/sparc">Linux Sparc</A></P>
<P>Note that some Sparc ethernet hardware gets its MAC address
from the host computer, and hence you can end up with multiple
interfaces all with the same MAC address.  If you need to
put more than one interface on the same net then use the
<CODE>hw</CODE> option to <CODE>ifconfig</CODE> to assign unique MAC address.</P>
<P>Issues regarding porting PCI drivers to the Sparc platform
are similar to those mentioned above for the AXP platform.
In addition there may be some endian issues, as the Sparc
is big endian, and the AXP and ix86 are little endian.</P>

<H3>Ethernet for Linux on Other Hardware.</H3>

<P>There are several other hardware platforms that Linux can
run on, such as Atari/Amiga (m68k). As in the Sparc case
it is best to check with the home site of each Linux
port to that platform to see what is currently supported.
(Links to such sites are welcome here - send them in!)</P>

<H3>Linking 10 or 100 BaseT without a Hub</H3>

<P>Can I link 10/100BaseT (RJ45) based systems together without a hub?</P>
<P>You can link 2 machines, but no more than that, without
extra devices/gizmos, by using a crossover cable.  Some newer
fancy autonegotiaton cards may not work on a crossover cable though.
And no, you can't hack together a hub just by
crossing a few wires and stuff. It's pretty much impossible
to do the collision signal right without duplicating a hub.</P>

<H3>SIOCSIFxxx: No such device</H3>

<P>I get a bunch of `SIOCSIFxxx: No such device' messages at
boot, followed by a `SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable'
What is wrong?</P>
<P>Your ethernet device was not detected at boot/module insertion
time, and when
<CODE>ifconfig</CODE> and <CODE>route</CODE> are run, they have no device
to work with. Use <CODE>dmesg | more</CODE> to review the
boot messages and see if there are any messages about
detecting an ethernet card.</P>

<H3>SIOCSFFLAGS: Try again</H3>

<P>I get `SIOCSFFLAGS: Try again' when I run `ifconfig' -- Huh?</P>
<P>Some other device has taken the IRQ that your ethercard
is trying to use, and so the ethercard can't use the IRQ.
You don't necessairly need to reboot to resolve this, as
some devices only grab the IRQs when they need them and
then release them when they are done. Examples are some
sound cards, serial ports, floppy disk driver, etc. You
can type <CODE>cat /proc/interrupts</CODE> to see which interrupts
are presently <EM>in use</EM>. Most of the
Linux ethercard drivers only grab the IRQ when they are
opened for use via `ifconfig'. If you can get the other
device to `let go' of the required IRQ line, then you
should be able to `Try again' with ifconfig.</P>

<H3>Using `ifconfig' and Link UNSPEC with HW-addr of 00:00:00:00:00:00</H3>

<P>When I run ifconfig with no arguments, it reports that
LINK is UNSPEC (instead of 10Mbs Ethernet) and it
also says that my hardware address is all zeros.</P>
<P>This is because people are running a newer version of
the `ifconfig' program than their kernel version. This
new version of ifconfig is not able to report these properties
when used in conjunction with an older kernel. You can either
upgrade your kernel, `downgrade' ifconfig, or simply ignore
it. The kernel knows your hardware address, so it really
doesn't matter if ifconfig can't read it.</P>
<P>You may also get strange information if the <CODE>ifconfig</CODE>
program you are using is a lot older than the kernel you are
using.</P>

<H3>Huge Number of RX and TX Errors</H3>

<P>When I run ifconfig with no arguments, it reports that I
have a huge error count in both rec'd and transmitted
packets. It all seems to work ok -- What is wrong?</P>
<P>Look again. It says <CODE>RX packets</CODE> <EM>big number</EM> <B>PAUSE</B>
<CODE>errors 0</CODE> <B>PAUSE</B> <CODE>dropped 0</CODE> <B>PAUSE</B> <CODE>overrun 0</CODE>.
And the same for the <CODE>TX</CODE> column.
Hence the big numbers you are seeing are the total number of
packets that your machine has rec'd and transmitted.
If you still find it confusing, try typing
<CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE> instead.</P>

<H3>Entries in <CODE>/dev/</CODE> for Ethercards</H3>

<P>I have /dev/eth0 as a link to /dev/xxx. Is this right?</P>
<P>Contrary to what you have heard, the files in /dev/* are not used.
You can delete any <CODE>/dev/wd0, /dev/ne0</CODE> and similar entries.</P>

<H3>Access to the raw Ethernet Device</H3>

<P>How do I get access to the raw ethernet device in linux,
without going through TCP/IP and friends?</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        int s=socket(AF_INET,SOCK_PACKET,htons(ETH_P_ALL));
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>This gives you a socket receiving every protocol type.
Do <CODE>recvfrom()</CODE> calls to it and it will fill the sockaddr
with device type in sa_family and the device name in the
sa_data array. I don't know who originally invented
SOCK_PACKET for Linux (its been in for ages) but its superb stuff.
You can use it to send stuff raw too via <CODE>sendto()</CODE> calls.
You have to have root access to do either of course.</P>

<H2><A NAME="perf"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. Performance Tips</A></H2>

<P>Here are some tips that you can use if you are suffering
from low ethernet throughput, or to gain a bit more
speed on those ftp transfers.</P>
<P>The <CODE>ttcp.c</CODE> program is a good test for measuring
raw throughput speed. Another common trick is to do
a <CODE>ftp> get large_file /dev/null</CODE> where
<CODE>large_file</CODE> is &gt; 1MB and residing in the buffer
cache on the Tx'ing machine. (Do the `get' at least
twice, as the first time will be priming the buffer
cache on the Tx'ing machine.) You want the file in
the buffer cache because you are not interested in
combining the file access speed from the disk into
your measurement. Which is also why you send the
incoming data to <CODE>/dev/null</CODE> instead of onto
the disk.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 General Concepts</A>
</H2>

<P>Even an 8 bit card is able to receive back-to-back packets
without any problems. The difficulty arises when the computer
doesn't get the Rx'd packets off the card quick enough to
make room for more incoming packets. If the computer does not
quickly clear the card's memory of the packets already received,
the card will have no place to put the new packet.</P>
<P>In this case
the card either drops the new packet, or writes over top of
a previously received packet. Either one seriously interrupts
the smooth flow of traffic by causing/requesting re-transmissions
and can seriously degrade performance by up to a factor of 5!</P>
<P>Cards with more onboard memory are able to ``buffer'' more
packets, and thus can handle larger bursts of
back-to-back packets without dropping packets.
This in turn means that the card does not require as low
a latency from the host computer with respect to pulling
the packets out of the buffer to avoid dropping packets.</P>
<P>Most 8 bit cards have an 8kB buffer, and most 16 bit cards have
a 16kB buffer. Most Linux drivers will reserve 3kB of that
buffer (for two Tx buffers), leaving only 5kB of
receive space for an 8 bit card. This is room enough for
only three full sized (1500 bytes) ethernet packets.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 ISA Cards and ISA Bus Speed</A>
</H2>

<P>As mentioned above, if the packets are removed from the card
fast enough, then a drop/overrun condition won't occur even
when the amount of Rx packet buffer memory is small. The
factor that sets the rate at which packets are removed from
the card to the computer's memory is the speed of the data path
that joins the two -- that being the ISA bus speed. (If the
CPU is a dog-slow 386sx-16, then this will also play a role.)</P>
<P>The recommended ISA bus clock is about 8MHz, but many
motherboards and peripheral devices can be run at higher
frequencies. The clock frequency for the ISA bus can usually
be set in the CMOS setup, by selecting a divisor of the
mainboard/CPU clock frequency. Some ISA and PCI/ISA
mainboards may not have this option, and so you are stuck
with the factory default.</P>
<P>For example, here are some receive speeds as measured by
the TTCP program on a 40MHz 486, with an  8 bit WD8003EP
card, for different ISA bus speeds.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        ISA Bus Speed (MHz)     Rx TTCP (kB/s)

        26.7                    1075
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>You would be hard pressed to do better than 1075kB/s with
<EM>any</EM> 10Mb/s ethernet card, using TCP/IP. However, don't expect
every system to work at fast ISA bus speeds. Most systems will
not function properly at speeds above 13MHz. (Also, some
PCI systems have the ISA bus speed fixed at 8MHz, so that
the end user does not have the option of increasing it.)</P>
<P>In addition to faster transfer speeds, one will usually also
benefit from a reduction in CPU usage due to the shorter
duration memory and I/O cycles. (Note that hard disks and
video cards located on the ISA bus will also usually experience
a performance increase from an increased ISA bus speed.)</P>
<P>Be sure to back up your data prior to experimenting with
ISA bus speeds in excess of 8MHz, and thouroughly test
that all ISA peripherals are operating properly after
making any speed increases.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Setting the TCP Rx Window</A>
</H2>


<P>Once again, cards with small amounts of onboard RAM and
relatively slow data paths between the card and the computer's
memory run into trouble. The default TCP Rx
window setting is 32kB, which means that a fast computer on
the same subnet as you can dump 32k of data on you without
stopping to see if you received any of it okay.</P>
<P>Recent versions of the <CODE>route</CODE> command have the ability
to set the size of this window on the fly. Usually it is only
for the local net that this window must be reduced, as computers
that are behind a couple of routers or gateways are `buffered'
enough to not pose a problem. An example usage would be:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        route add &lt;whatever> ... window &lt;win_size>
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>where <CODE>win_size</CODE> is the size of the window you wish to
use (in bytes). An 8 bit 3c503 card on an ISA bus operating
at a speed of 8MHz or less would work well with a window
size of about 4kB. Too large a window will cause overruns
and dropped packets, and a drastic reduction in ethernet
throughput. You can check the operating status by doing
a <CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE> which will display any
dropped or overrun conditions that occurred.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Increasing NFS performance</A>
</H2>

<P>Some people have found that using 8 bit
cards in NFS clients causes poorer than expected performance,
when using 8kB (native Sun) NFS packet size.</P>
<P>The possible reason for this could be due to the difference
in on board buffer size between the 8 bit and the 16 bit cards.
The maximum ethernet packet size is about 1500 bytes. Now that
8kB NFS packet will arrive as about 6 back to back maximum size
ethernet packets. Both the 8 and 16 bit cards have no problem
Rx'ing back to back packets. The problem arises when the machine
doesn't remove the packets from the cards buffer in time, and the
buffer overflows. The fact that 8 bit cards take an extra ISA
bus cycle per transfer doesn't help either. What you <EM>can</EM> do
if you have an 8 bit card is either set the NFS transfer
size to 2kB (or even 1kB), or try increasing the ISA bus speed
in order to get the card's buffer cleared out faster.
I have found that an old WD8003E card at 8MHz (with no other
system load) can keep up with a large receive at 2kB NFS size,
but not at 4kB, where performance was degraded by a factor of three.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the default mount option is to use 1kB
size and you have at least a 16 bit ISA card, you may find
a significant increase in going to 4kB (or even 8kB).</P>

<H2><A NAME="card-intro"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Vendor/Manufacturer/Model Specific Information</A></H2>


<P>The following lists many cards in alphabetical order by vendor
name and then product identifier. Beside each product ID, you
will see either `Supported', `Semi-Supported', `Obsolete',
`Dropped' or `Not Supported'.</P>
<P>Supported means that a driver for that card exists, and many
people are happily using it and it seems quite reliable.</P>
<P>Semi-Supported means that a driver exists, but at least one
of the following descriptions is true:
(1) The driver and/or hardware are buggy, which may cause poor
performance, failing connections or even crashes.
(2) The driver is new or the card is fairly uncommon,
and hence the driver has
seen very little use/testing and the driver author has had
very little feedback. Obviously (2) is preferable to (1), and
the individual description of the card/driver should make it
clear which one holds true. In either case, you will probably have
to answer `Y' when asked ``Prompt for development and/or
incomplete code/drivers?'' when running <CODE>make config</CODE>.</P>
<P>Obsolete means that a driver exists, and was probably at
one time considered Semi-Supported. However, due to lack of
interest, users, and support, it is known to not work anymore.
The driver is still in the kernel, but disabled in the 
configuration option menu.  The general plan is that if it
does not get updated by the next kernel development cycle,
it will be dropped entirely.  Usually a driver marked obsolete
simply needs an update to match changes in the kernel to 
driver interface, or other similar kernel API changes.</P>
<P>Dropped means that the driver was once obsolete (see above)
and since there was not enough interest in fixing it, it
has been removed from the current kernel tree.  There is
nothing stopping anyone from copying the driver from an
older kernel, making the required updates and using it.</P>
<P>Not Supported means there is not a driver currently available
for that card. This could be due to a lack of interest in
hardware that is rare/uncommon, or because the vendors won't
release the hardware documentation required to write a driver.</P>
<P>Note that the difference between `Supported' and `Semi-Supported'
is rather subjective, and is based on user feedback.
So be warned that you may find
a card listed as semi-supported works perfectly for you (which
is great), or that a card listed as supported gives you no end
of troubles and problems (which is not so great).</P>
<P>After the status, the name of the driver given in the linux kernel
is listed. This will also be the name of the driver module that
would be used in the <CODE>alias eth0 driver_name</CODE> line that is
found in the <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> module configuration file.</P>


<H2><A NAME="3com"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 3Com</A>
</H2>


<P>If you are not sure what your card is, but you think it is a
3Com card, you can probably figure it out from the assembly
number. 3Com has a document `Identifying 3Com Adapters By
Assembly Number' (ref 24500002) that would most likely clear
things up.  Also check out their WWW/FTP site with various goodies:
<CODE>www.3Com.com</CODE> that you may find useful (including PDFs
with technical info for their cards).</P>


<H3><A NAME="3c501"></A> 3c501</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c501</P>
<P>This obsolete stone-age 8 bit card is really
too brain-damaged to use. Avoid it like the plague. Do not
purchase this card, even as a joke. It's performance
is horrible, and it breaks in many ways.</P>
<P>For those not yet convinced, the 3c501 can only do one
thing at a time -- while you are removing one packet
from the single-packet buffer it cannot receive
another packet, nor can it receive a packet while
loading a transmit packet. This was fine for a
network between two 8088-based computers where
processing each packet and replying took 10's of
msecs, but modern networks send back-to-back
packets for almost every transaction.</P>
<P>AutoIRQ works, DMA isn't used, the autoprobe only
looks at <CODE>0x280</CODE> and <CODE>0x300</CODE>, and the debug level is set
with the third boot-time argument.</P>
<P>Once again, the use of a 3c501 is <EM>strongly discouraged</EM>!
Even more so with a IP multicast kernel, as you will
grind to a halt while listening to <EM>all</EM> multicast
packets. See the comments at the top of the source code
for more details.</P>

<H3><A NAME="3c503"></A> EtherLink II, 3c503, 3c503/16</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c503 (+8390)</P>
<P>The 3c503 does not have ``EEPROM setup'',
so a diagnostic/setup program
isn't needed before running the card with Linux. The
shared memory address of the 3c503 is set using jumpers
that are shared with the boot PROM address. This is
confusing to people familiar with other ISA cards,
where you always leave the jumper set to ``disable''
unless you have a boot PROM.</P>
<P>These cards should be about the same speed as the same bus
width WD80x3, but turn out to be actually a bit slower.
These shared-memory ethercards also have a
programmed I/O mode that doesn't use the 8390
facilities (their engineers found too many bugs!)
The Linux 3c503 driver can also work with the 3c503
in programmed-I/O mode, but this is slower and less
reliable than shared memory mode. Also, programmed-I/O
mode is not as well tested when updating the drivers.
You shouldn't use the programmed-I/O mode
unless you need it for compatibility with another
operating system that is used on the same computer.</P>
<P>The 3c503's IRQ line is set in software, with no hints
from an EEPROM. Unlike the MS-DOS drivers, the
Linux driver has capability to autoIRQ: it uses the
first available IRQ line in {5,2/9,3,4}, selected each
time the card is ifconfig'ed.  Note that `ifconfig' will 
return EAGAIN if no IRQ line is available at that time.</P>
<P>Some common problems that people have with the 503
are discussed in 
<A HREF="#3com-probs">Problems with...</A>.</P>
<P>If you intend on using this driver as a loadable module
you should probably see
<A HREF="#modules">Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A>
for module specific information.</P>

<H3><A NAME="3c505"></A> Etherlink Plus 3c505</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c505</P>
<P>These cards use the i82586 chip but are not that many of them about.
It is included in the standard kernel, but it is classed as
an alpha driver. See 
<A HREF="#alfa">Alpha Drivers</A>
for important information on using alpha-test ethernet drivers
with Linux.</P>
<P>There is also the file
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/README.3c505</CODE>
that you should read if you are going to use one of these cards.
It contains various options that you can enable/disable.</P>

<H3><A NAME="3c507"></A> Etherlink-16 3c507</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c507</P>
<P>This card uses one of the Intel chips, and the
development of the driver is closely related to
the development of the Intel Ether Express driver.
The driver is included in the standard kernel
release, but as an alpha driver.
See 
<A HREF="#alfa">Alpha Drivers</A> for important
information on using alpha-test ethernet drivers
with Linux. </P>

<H3><A NAME="3c509"></A> Etherlink III, 3c509 / 3c509B</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c509</P>
<P>This card was fairly inexpensive and had
good performance for an ISA non-bus-master design.
The drawbacks were that the original 3c509
required very low interrupt latency. The 3c509B
shouldn't suffer from the same problem, due to
having a larger buffer. (See below.) These cards
use PIO transfers, similar to a ne2000 card, and so
a shared memory card such as a wd8013 will be more
efficient in comparison.</P>
<P>The original 3c509 had a small packet buffer
(4kB total, 2kB Rx, 2kB Tx), causing the driver to
occasionally drop a packet if interrupts were masked for
too long. To minimize this problem, you can try unmasking
interrupts during IDE disk transfers (see <CODE>man hdparm</CODE>) and/or
increasing your ISA bus speed so IDE transfers finish sooner.</P>
<P>The newer model 3c509B has 8kB on board, and the buffer
can be split 4/4, 5/3 or 6/2 for Rx/Tx. This setting
is changed with the DOS configuration utility, and is stored
on the EEPROM. This should alleviate the
above problem with the original 3c509.</P>
<P>3c509B users should use either the supplied DOS
utility to disable the <EM>plug and play</EM> support, <EM>and</EM>
to set the output media to what they require. The linux
driver currently does <EM>not</EM> support the Autodetect
media setting, so you <EM>have</EM> to select 10Base-T or
10Base-2 or AUI.
Note that if you turn off PnP entirely, you should exit the
utility and then follow that with a hard
reset to ensure that the new settings take effect.</P>
<P>Some people ask about the ``Server or Workstation'' and ``Highest
Modem Speed'' settings presented in the DOS configuration utility.
These settings don't actually change any hardware settings, rather
they are only tuning hints to the DOS driver.  The linux driver
does not need or use these hints.   Also, DON'T enable EISA mode
on this ISA card unless you really have an EISA machine, or 
you may end up needing to find an EISA machine just to get
your ISA card back into ISA mode!</P>
<P>The card with the lowest hardware ethernet address
will <EM>always</EM> end up being <CODE>eth0</CODE> in a multiple ISA 
3c509 configuration.  This shouldn't matter
to anyone, except for those people who want to assign
a 6 byte hardware address to a particular interface.
If this really bothers you, have a look at Donald's latest driver,
as you may be able to use a <CODE>0x3c509</CODE> value in the unused mem
address fields to order the detection to suit your needs.</P>

Also knownas a `laptop tornado'.</P>

<H3>3c562</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c589_cs</P>
<P>This PCMCIA card is the combination of a 3c589B ethernet card
with a modem. The modem appears as a standard modem to the
end user. The only difficulty is getting the two separate
linux drivers to share one interrupt. There are a couple of new
registers and some hardware interrupt sharing support.
Thanks again to Cameron for getting a sample unit and
documentation sent off to David Hinds.</P>

<H3>3c575</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x</P>
<P>Note that to support this Cardbus device in old 2.2 kernels,
you had to use 3c575_cb.c from the pcmcia_cs package.</P>


<H3><A NAME="3c579"></A> 3c579</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c509</P>
<P>The EISA version of the 509. The current EISA version
uses the same 16 bit wide chip rather than a 32 bit
interface, so the performance increase isn't stunning.
Make sure the card is configured for EISA addressing mode.
Read the above 3c509 section for info on the driver.</P>


<H3><A NAME="3c589"></A> 3c589 / 3c589B</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c589_cs</P>
<P>Many people have been using this PCMCIA card for quite some time     
now.  The "B" in the name means the same here as it does for
the 3c509 case.</P>


<H3><A NAME="vortex"></A> 3c590 / 3c595</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x</P>
<P>These ``Vortex'' cards are for PCI bus machines, with the '590
being 10Mbps and the '595 being 3Com's 100Mbs offering.
Also note that you can run the '595 as a '590 (i.e. in a 10Mbps mode).
The 3c59x line was replaced by the 3c9xx line quite some time ago,
and so these cards are considered rather old.</P>
<P>Note that there are two different 3c590 cards out there, early
models that had 32kB of on-board memory, and later models that
only have 8kB of memory.  The 3c595 cards have 64kB,
as you can't get away with only 8kB RAM at 100Mbps!</P>

<H3>3c592 / 3c597</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x</P>
<P>These are  the EISA versions of the 3c59x
series of cards. The 3c592/3c597 (aka Demon) should work with
the vortex driver discussed above.</P>

<H3>3c900 / 3c905 / 3c905B / 3c905C / 3c905CX</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x</P>
<P>These cards (aka `Boomerang', aka EtherLink III XL) have been
released to take over the place of the 3c590/3c595 cards,
with some additional support added to the vortex/3c59x driver.
The driver found in older kernels may not support the latest
revision(s) of these cards, so you may need a driver update.</P>
<P>Note that the 3c905C has support for TCP/UDP/IP checksumming
in hardware support - meaning less work for the computer
CPU to do!</P>

<H3>3c985 (Gigabit acenic, aka Tigon2)</H3>

<P>These are a series of low-cost ethercards using the 79C960 version

<H3><A NAME="at1700"></A> AT1700</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: at1700</P>
<P>Note that to access this driver during <CODE>make config</CODE>
you still have to answer `Y' when asked ``Prompt for
development and/or incomplete code/drivers?'' at
the first. This is simply due to lack of feedback on the
driver stability due to it being a relatively rare card.
If you have problems with the driver that ships with
the kernel then you may be interested in the alternative 
driver available at:
<CODE>http://www.cc.hit-u.ac.jp/nagoya/at1700/</CODE></P>
<P>The Allied Telesis AT1700 series ethercards are based
on the Fujitsu MB86965. This chip uses a programmed
I/O interface, and a pair of fixed-size transmit
buffers. This allows small groups of packets to
be sent back-to-back, with a short pause while
switching buffers.</P>
<P>The Fujitsu chip used on the AT1700 has a design flaw:
it can only be fully reset by doing a power cycle of the machine.
Pressing the reset button doesn't reset the bus interface. This
wouldn't be so bad, except that it can only be reliably detected
when it has been freshly reset. The solution/work-around is to
power-cycle the machine if the kernel has a problem detecting
the AT1700.</P>

<P>Carl Ching of AMD was kind enough to provide a very
detailed description of all the relevant AMD ethernet
products which helped clear up this section.</P>

<H3><A NAME="lance"></A> AMD LANCE (7990, 79C960/961/961A, PCnet-ISA)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: lance</P>
<P>There really is no AMD ethernet card. You are probably reading this
because the only markings you could find on your card said AMD
and the above number. The 7990 is the original `LANCE' chip,
but most stuff (including this document) refer to all these
similar chips as `LANCE' chips. (...incorrectly, I might add.)</P>
<P>These above numbers refer to chips from AMD
that are the heart of many ethernet cards.
For example, the Allied Telesis AT1500 (see
<A HREF="#at-1500">AT1500</A>) and the NE1500/2100 (see
<A HREF="#ne1500">NE1500</A>)  use these chips.</P>
<P>The 7990/79c90 have long been replaced by newer versions.
The 79C960 (a.k.a. PCnet-ISA) essentially contains the 79c90
core, along with all the other hardware support required, which
allows a single-chip ethernet solution. The 79c961 (PCnet-ISA+)
is a jumperless Plug and Play version of the '960. The final
chip in the ISA series is the 79c961A (PCnet-ISA II), which
adds full duplex capabilities.
All cards with one of these chips should work with
the lance.c driver, with the exception of very old cards that
used the original 7990 in a shared memory configuration. These
old cards can be spotted by the lack of jumpers for a DMA channel.</P>
<P>One common problem people have is the `busmaster arbitration
failure' message. This is printed out when the LANCE driver
can't get access to the bus after a reasonable amount of time
has elapsed (50us). This usually indicates that the motherboard
implementation of bus-mastering DMA is broken, or some other device
is hogging the bus, or there is a DMA channel conflict. If your BIOS
setup has the `GAT option' (for Guaranteed Access Time) then try
toggling/altering that setting to see if it helps.</P>
<P>Also note that the driver only looks at the addresses:
<CODE>0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360</CODE> for a valid card, and any
address supplied by an <CODE>ether=</CODE> boot argument is silently
ignored (this will be fixed) so make sure your card is configured
for one of the above I/O addresses for now.</P>
<P>The driver will still work fine, even
if more than 16MB of memory is installed, since low-memory
`bounce-buffers' are used when needed (i.e. any data from
above 16MB is copied into a buffer below 16MB before being
given to the card to transmit.)</P>
<P>The DMA channel can be set with the low bits
of the otherwise-unused dev->mem_start value (a.k.a. PARAM_1).
(see 
<A HREF="#ether">PARAM_1</A>)
If unset it is probed for by enabling each free DMA channel
in turn and checking if initialization succeeds.</P>
<P>The HP-J2405A board is an exception: with this board it's easy
to read the EEPROM-set values for the IRQ, and DMA.</P>

<H3>AMD 79C901 (Home PNA PHY)</H3>

<H3><A NAME="pcnet-pci"></A> AMD 79C970/970A (PCnet-PCI)</H3>

<P>This is the PCnet-PCI -- similar to the PCnet-32, but designed
for PCI bus based systems. Please see the
above PCnet-32 information.
This means that you need to build a kernel with
PCI BIOS support enabled. The '970A adds full duplex support
along with some other features to the original '970 design.</P>
<P>Note that the Boca implementation of the 79C970 fails on
fast Pentium machines. This is a hardware problem, as it
affects DOS users as well. See the Boca section for more
details.</P>

driver stability due to it being a relatively rare card.
Feedback has been low even though the driver has

<H3>Apricot Xen-II On Board Ethernet</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: apricot</P>
<P>This on board ethernet uses an i82596 bus-master chip.
It can only be at I/O address <CODE>0x300</CODE>.
By looking at the driver source,
it appears that the IRQ is also hardwired to 10.</P>
<P>Earlier versions of the driver had a tendency to think
that anything living at <CODE>0x300</CODE> was an apricot NIC.
Since then the hardware address is checked to avoid these
false detections.</P>

<H2><A NAME="arcnet"></A> <A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Arcnet</A>
</H2>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: arcnet (arc-rimi, com90xx, com20020)</P>
<P>With the very low cost and better performance of ethernet,
chances are that most places will be giving away their Arcnet
hardware for free, resulting in a lot of home systems with Arcnet.</P>
<P>An advantage of Arcnet is that all of the cards have identical
interfaces, so one driver will work for everyone. It also has
built in error handling so that it supposedly never loses a packet.
(Great for UDP traffic!) Note that the arcnet driver
uses `arc0' as its name instead of the usual `eth0' for
ethernet devices.</P>
<P>There are information files contained in the standard kernel for
setting jumpers, general hints and where to mail bug reports.</P>
<P>Supposedly the driver also works with the 100Mbs ARCnet cards
as well!</P>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: lance, pcnet32</P>
<P>These cards are based on AMD's PCnet chips.
Many people reported endless problems with these VLB/PCI cards. 
The problem was supposedly due to Boca not installing 
some capacitors that AMD recommended.
(The older ISA cards don't appear to suffer the same problems.)
Boca was offering a `warranty repair' for
affected owners, which involved adding one of the missing
capacitors, but it appears that this fix didn't work 100
percent for most people, although it helped some.  The
cards are so old now that it wouldn't be worth pursuing.</P>

<P>Lack of programming information from Cabletron at the time

the drivers were not supported as well as they could have been.</P>

However, at this point in time, there is little demand for
modified/updated drivers for the old E20xx and E21xx cards.</P>

<H3><A NAME="e2100"></A> E2100</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: e2100 (+8390)</P>
<P>The E2100 is a poor design. Whenever it maps its
shared memory in during a packet transfer, it
maps it into the <EM>whole 128K region!</EM> That means you
<B>can't</B> safely use another interrupt-driven shared
memory device in that region, including another E2100.
It will work most of the time, but every once in
a while it will bite you. (Yes, this problem can
be avoided by turning off interrupts while
transferring packets, but that will almost certainly
lose clock ticks.) Also, if you mis-program the board,
or halt the machine at just the wrong moment, even
the reset button won't bring it back. You will <EM>have</EM>
to turn it off and <EM>leave</EM> it off for about 30 seconds.</P>
<P>Media selection is automatic, but you can override this
with the low bits of the dev-&gt;mem_end parameter.
See 
<A HREF="#ether">PARAM_2</A>. Module users
can specify an <CODE>xcvr=N</CODE> value as an <CODE>option</CODE> in
the <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> file.</P>
<P>Also, don't confuse the E2100 for a NE2100 clone.
The E2100 is a shared memory NatSemi DP8390 design,
roughly similar to a brain-damaged WD8013, whereas
the NE2100 (and NE1500) use a bus-mastering AMD
LANCE design.</P>

<H3>Compaq Deskpro / Compaq XL (Embedded AMD Chip)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: pcnet32</P>
<P>Machines such as the XL series have an AMD 79c97x PCI chip
on the mainboard that can be used with the standard LANCE
driver. But before you can use it, you have to do some
trickery to get the PCI BIOS to a place where Linux can
see it. Frank Maas was kind enough to provide the
details:</P>
<P>`` The problem with this Compaq machine however is that the PCI
directory is loaded in high memory, at a spot where the Linux
kernel can't (won't) reach. Result: the card is never detected nor
is it usable (sideline: the mouse won't work either)
The workaround (as described thoroughly in
http://www-c724.uibk.ac.at/XL/)
is to load MS-DOS, launch a little driver Compaq wrote and then
load the Linux kernel using LOADLIN. Ok, I'll give you time to
say `yuck, yuck', but for now this is the only working solution
I know of. The little driver simply moves the PCI directory to
a place where it is normally stored (and where Linux can find it).''</P>
<P>The DOS utility <CODE>movepci.exe</CODE> is apparently in Compaq's

A maximum of two of the ISA cards can be used, because they

If you are intending to do this, please read the notes in

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: ewrk3</P>
<P>These cards use a proprietary
chip from DEC, as opposed to the LANCE chip used in the
earlier cards like the DE200. These cards support both shared
memory or programmed I/O, although you take about a 50%performance hit if you use PIO mode. The shared memory size can
be set to 2kB, 32kB or 64kB, but only 2 and 32 have been tested
with this driver. David says that the performance is virtually
identical between the 2kB and 32kB mode. There is more information
(including using the driver as a loadable module) at the top
of the driver file <CODE>ewrk3.c</CODE> and also in <CODE>README.ewrk3</CODE>.
Both of these files come with the standard kernel distribution.
This driver has Alpha CPU support like depca.c does.</P>
<P>The standard driver has a number
of interesting ioctl() calls that can be used to get or clear
packet statistics, read/write the EEPROM, change the
hardware address, and the like. Hackers can see the source
code for more info on that one.</P>
<P>David has also written a configuration utility for this
card (along the lines of the DOS program <CODE>NICSETUP.EXE</CODE>)

<H3><A NAME="dec-21040"></A> DEC 21040, 21041, 2114x, Tulip </H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: de4x5, tulip</P>
<P>The DEC 21040 is a bus-mastering single chip ethernet solution
from Digital, similar to AMD's PCnet chip. The 21040 is
specifically designed for the PCI bus architecture.
Apparently these chips are no longer being produced, as Intel
has bought the semiconductor portion of DEC and is favouring
their own ethernet chip(s).</P>
<P>You have a choice of <EM>two</EM> drivers for cards based on this
chip. There is the DE425 driver discussed above, and the
generic 21040  `tulip' driver.</P>
<P><B>Warning:</B> Even though your card may be based upon this chip,
<EM>the drivers may not work for you</EM>. David C. Davies writes:</P>
<P>``There are no guarantees that either `tulip.c' OR `de4x5.c'
will run any DC2114x based card other than those they've been
written to support.  WHY?? You ask.  Because there is a register,
the General Purpose Register (CSR12) that (1) in the DC21140A is
programmable by each vendor and they all do it differently
(2) in the DC21142/3 this is now an SIA control register
(a la DC21041). The only small ray of hope is that we can decode the
SROM to help set up the driver. However, this is not a guaranteed
solution since some vendors (e.g. SMC 9332 card) don't follow the
Digital Semiconductor recommended SROM programming format."</P>
<P>In non-technical terms, this means that if you aren't sure that an
unknown card with a DC2114x chip will work with the linux driver(s),
then make sure you can return the card to the place of
purchase <EM>before</EM> you pay for it.</P>
<P>The 21041 chip is also found in place of the 21040
on most of the later SMC EtherPower cards.
The 21140 is for supporting 100Base-T and
works with the Linux drivers for the 21040 chip.
To use David's <CODE>de4x5</CODE> driver with non-DEC cards, have a

of the card.  It uses the Fujitsu MB86965 chip that is also 
used on the at1700 cards.</P>

<H2><A NAME="intel"></A> <A NAME="ss4.24">4.24 Intel Ethernet Cards</A>
</H2>


<P>Note that the naming of the various Intel cards is ambiguous
and confusing at best.  If in doubt, then check the <CODE>i8xxxx</CODE>
number on the main chip on the card or for PCI cards, use the
PCI information in the <CODE>/proc</CODE> directory and then
compare that to the numbers listed here.  Finally, there was
a page at http://support.intel.com in the network area that
may also be some help if you don't know what card you have.</P>


<H3>Ether Express</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: eexpress</P>
<P>This card uses the intel i82586.
Earlier versions of this driver (in v1.2 kernels) were
classed as alpha-test, as it didn't work well for most people.
The driver in the v2.0 kernel seems to work much better
for those who have tried it, although the driver source still
lists it as experimental and more problematic on faster
machines.</P>
<P>The comments at the top of the
driver source list some of the problems (and fixes!) associated
with these cards. The slowdown hack of replacing all the <CODE>outb</CODE>
with <CODE>outb_p</CODE> in the driver has been reported to avoid lockups
for at least one user.  Also check that the size of the RAM
buffer reported by the driver matches what the Intel configuration
utility reports.</P>

<H3>Ether Express PRO/10 (PRO/10+)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: eepro</P>
<P>Bao Chau Ha has written a driver for these cards that has been
included into early 1.3.x kernels. It may also work with some of
the Compaq built-in ethernet systems that are based on the
i82595 chip.  You may have to use the configuration utility
that came with the card to disable PnP support where applicable.</P>

<H3>Ether Express PRO/10 PCI (EISA)</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: ? (distributed separately)</P>
<P>There is a driver for the PCI version that is distributed 
separately from the default kernel. 
These cards use the PLX9036 PCI interface chip
with the Intel i82596 LAN controller chip. If your card has
the i82557 chip, then you <EM>don't</EM> have this card, but
rather the version discussed next, and hence want the
EEPro100 driver instead.</P>
<P>You can get the alpha driver for the PRO/10 PCI card,
along with instructions on how to use it at:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ultranet.com/~stalba/eep10pci.html">EEPro10 Driver</A></P>
<P>If you have the EISA card, you will probably have to hack the
driver a bit to account for the different (PCI vs. EISA)
detection mechanisms that are used in each case.</P>

<P>The 83820 is a 10/100/1000 Mbps 64 bit PCI ethernet NIC, and
the 83821 is a 32 bit PCI part (but it appears that the

<H2><A NAME="novell"></A> <A NAME="ss4.31">4.31 Novell Ethernet, NExxxx and associated clones.</A>

<P>The prefix `NE' came from Novell Ethernet. Novell followed the

(spun off?) Eagle, just to get reasonably-priced ethercards into
the market. (The now ubiquitous NE2000 card.)</P>

<H3><A NAME="ne2k"></A> NE1000, NE2000</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: ne (+8390)</P>
<P>The ne2000 is now a generic name for a bare-bones design around
the NatSemi 8390 chip. They use programmed I/O rather than
shared memory, leading to easier installation but
slightly lower performance and a few problems. 
Some of the more common problems that arise
with NE2000 cards are listed in 
<A HREF="#ne2k-probs">Problems with...</A></P>
<P>Some NE2000 clones use the National
Semiconductor `AT/LANTic' 83905 chip, which offers
a shared memory mode similar to the wd8013 and EEPROM
software configuration. The shared memory mode will offer
less CPU usage (i.e. more efficient) than the programmed
I/O mode.</P>
<P>In general it is not a good idea to put a NE2000
clone at I/O address <CODE>0x300</CODE> because nearly
<EM>every</EM> device driver probes there at boot. Some
poor NE2000 clones don't take kindly to being prodded
in the wrong areas, and will respond by locking your
machine. Also <CODE>0x320</CODE> is bad because SCSI drivers
probe into <CODE>0x330</CODE>.</P>
<P>Donald has written a NE2000 diagnostic program (ne2k.c)
for all ne2000 cards.
See 
<A HREF="#diag">Diagnostic Programs</A> for more
information.</P>
<P>If you intend on using this driver as a loadable module
you should probably see
<A HREF="#modules">Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A>

<H3><A NAME="ne2k-pci"></A> NE2000-PCI (RealTek/Winbond/Compex)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: ne, ne2k-pci (+8390)</P>
<P>Yes, believe it or not, people are making PCI cards based on
the more than ten year old interface 
design of the ne2000. At the moment
nearly all of these cards are based on the RealTek 8029 chip,
or the Winbond 89c940 chip. The Compex, KTI, VIA and Netvin cards
apparently also use these chips, but have a different PCI ID.</P>
<P>The latest v2.0 kernel has support to automatically detect all
these cards and use them. (If you are using a kernel v2.0.34 or
older, you should upgrade to ensure your card will be detected.)
There are now two drivers to choose from; the original ISA/PCI
<CODE>ne.c</CODE> driver, and a relatively new PCI-only <CODE>ne2k-pci.c</CODE>
driver.</P>
<P>To use the original ISA/PCI driver you have to say `Y'  to
the `Other ISA cards' option when running <CODE>make config</CODE> as
you are actually using the same NE2000 driver as the ISA cards
use. (That should also give you a hint that these cards aren't
anywhere as intelligent as say a PCNet-PCI or DEC 21040 card...)</P>
<P>The newer PCI-only driver differs from the ISA/PCI driver in
that all the support for old NE1000 8 bit cards has been removed
and that data is moved to/from the card in bigger blocks, without
any intervening pauses that the older ISA-NE2000's required for
reliable operation.  The result is a driver that is slightly
smaller and slightly more efficient, but don't get too excited
as the difference will not be obvious under normal use.  (If you
really wanted maximum efficiency/low CPU use, then a PCI-NE2000
is simply a very poor choice.) Driver updates and more
information can be found at:</P>
<P><CODE>http://www.scyld.com/network</CODE></P>
<P>If you have a NE2000 PCI card that is <EM>not</EM>  detected by
the most current version of the driver, please contact the
maintainer of the NE2000 driver as listed
in <CODE>/usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS</CODE> along with the output
from a <CODE>cat /proc/pci</CODE> and <CODE>dmesg</CODE> so that
support for your card can also be added to the driver.</P>
<P>Also note that various card makers have been known to put
`NE2000 Compatible' stickers on their product boxes even when
it is completely different (e.g. PCNet-PCI or RealTek 8139).
If in doubt check the main chip number against this document.</P>

<H3>NE-10/100</H3>

<P>This is an EISA 8390 based shared memory card. An experimetal

work fine, but the EISA IRQ and shared memory address detection
appears not to work with (at least) the early revision cards.
(This problem is not unique to the Linux world either...)
In that case, you have to supply them to the driver.
For example, card at IRQ 5 and shared memory <CODE>0xd0000</CODE>,
with a modular driver, add
<CODE>options es3210 irq=5 mem=0xd0000</CODE> to <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>.
Or with the driver compiled into the kernel, supply at
boot <CODE>ether=5,0,0xd0000,eth0</CODE>
The I/O base is automatically detected

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: lance</P>
<P>As of kernel 1.3.23, the generic LANCE driver had a check
added to it for the <CODE>0x52, 0x44</CODE> NI6510EB specific signature.
Others have reported that this signature is not the same
for all NI6510EB cards however, which will cause the lance
driver to not detect your card. If this happens to you, you
can change the probe (at about line 322 in lance.c) to printk()
out what the values are for your card and then use them instead
of the <CODE>0x52, 0x44</CODE> defaults.</P>
<P>The cards should probably be run in `high-performance' mode

<H3>WD8003, SMC Elite</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: wd (+8390)</P>
<P>These are the 8-bit versions of the card. The
8 bit 8003 is slightly less expensive, but only
worth the savings for light use. Note that some
of the non-EEPROM cards (clones with jumpers, or
old <EM>old</EM> old wd8003 cards) have no way of reporting
the IRQ line used. In this case, auto-irq is used, and if
that fails, the driver silently assings IRQ 5.
You can get the SMC setup/driver disks from SMC's ftp site.
Note that some of the
newer SMC `SuperDisk' programs will fail to detect
the real old EEPROM-less cards. The file <CODE>SMCDSK46.EXE</CODE>
seems to be a good all-round choice. Also the jumper
settings for all their cards are in an ASCII text file in the
aforementioned archive. The latest (greatest?) version
can be obtained from <CODE>ftp.smc.com</CODE>.</P>
<P>As these are basically the
same as their 16 bit counterparts (WD8013 / SMC Elite16),
you should see the next section for more information.</P>


<H3><A NAME="8013"></A> WD8013, SMC Elite16</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: wd (+8390)</P>
<P>Over the
years the design has added more registers and an
EEPROM. (The first wd8003 cards appeared about ten years ago!)
Clones usually go by the `8013' name, and
usually use a non-EEPROM (jumpered) design.
Late model SMC cards will have the SMC 83c690 chip instead
of the original Nat Semi DP8390 found on earlier cards.
The shared memory design makes the cards a bit faster
than PIO cards, especially with larger packets.
More importantly, from the
driver's point of view, it avoids a few bugs in the
programmed-I/O mode of the 8390, allows safe
multi-threaded access to the packet buffer, and
it doesn't have a programmed-I/O data register that
hangs your machine during warm-boot probes.</P>
<P>Non-EEPROM cards that can't just read the selected
IRQ will attempt auto-irq, and if that fails, they will
silently assign IRQ 10. (8 bit versions will assign IRQ 5)</P>
<P>Cards with a non standard amount of memory on board can
have the memory size specified at boot (or as an option
in <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> if using modules).
The standard memory size is
8kB for an 8bit card and 16kB for a 16bit card.
For example, the older WD8003EBT cards could be jumpered
for 32kB memory. To make full use of that RAM, you would
use something like (for I/O=0x280 and IRQ 9):

<H3><A NAME="ultra"></A> SMC Elite Ultra</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: smc-ultra (+8390)</P>
<P>This ethercard is based on the
83c790 chip from SMC, which has
a few new features over the 83c690. While it has a mode that is
similar to the older SMC ethercards, it's not entirely
compatible with the old WD80*3 drivers. However, in
this mode it shares most of its code with the other
8390 drivers, while operating slightly faster than a
WD8013 clone.</P>
<P>Since part of the Ultra <EM>looks like</EM>
an 8013, the Ultra probe is supposed to find an
Ultra before the wd8013 probe has a chance to
mistakenly identify it.</P>
<P>Donald mentioned that it is possible to write a separate
driver for the Ultra's `Altego' mode which allows
chaining transmits at the cost of inefficient use of receive
buffers, but that will probably not happen.</P>
<P>Bus-Master SCSI host adaptor users take note: In the
manual that ships with Interactive UNIX, it mentions
that a bug in the SMC Ultra will cause data corruption
with SCSI disks being run from an aha-154X host adaptor.
This will probably bite aha-154X compatible cards, such
as the BusLogic boards, and the AMI-FastDisk SCSI host
adaptors as well.</P>
<P>SMC has acknowledged the problem occurs with
Interactive, and older Windows NT drivers. It is
a hardware conflict with early revisions of the card
that can be worked around in the driver design. The current
Ultra driver protects against this by only enabling the
shared memory during data transfers with the card. Make sure
your kernel version is at least 1.1.84, or that the driver
version reported at boot is at least <CODE>smc-ultra.c:v1.12</CODE>
otherwise you are vulnerable.</P>

<P>This EISA card shares a lot in common with its ISA counterpart.
A working (and stable) driver is included in both v2.0 
and v2.2 kernels.  Thanks go to Leonard
Zubkoff for purchasing some of these cards so that linux support
could be added for them.</P>

<H3>SMC EtherEZ (8416)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: smc-ultra (+8390)</P>
<P>This card uses SMC's 83c795 chip and supports the Plug 'n Play
specification. It also has an <EM>SMC Ultra</EM> compatible mode,
which allows it to be used with the Linux Ultra driver.
For best results, use the SMC supplied program (avail. from
their www/ftp site) to disable PnP and configure it for
shared memory mode.  See the above information for notes on
the Ultra driver.</P>
<P>For v1.2 kernels, the card had to be configured for
shared memory operation. However v2.0 kernels can use the
card in shared memory or programmed I/O mode. Shared
memory mode will be slightly faster, and use
less CPU resources as well.</P>

<H3><A NAME="smc-pci"></A> SMC EtherPower PCI (8432)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: de4x5, tulip</P>
<P>NB: The EtherPower II is an entirely different card. See
below!
These cards are
a basic DEC 21040 implementation, i.e. one big chip
and a couple of transceivers. Donald has used one
of these cards for his development of the generic
21040 driver (aka <CODE>tulip.c</CODE>). Thanks to Duke Kamstra,
once again, for supplying a card to do development on.</P>
<P>Some of the later revisons of this card use the newer
DEC 21041 chip, which may cause problems with
older versions of the tulip driver. If you have problems,
make sure you are using the latest driver release, which
may not yet be included in the current kernel source tree.</P>
<P>See 
<A HREF="#dec-21040">DEC 21040</A> for more

<P>Apparently, the latest revision of the card, the EtherPower-II
uses the 9432 chip. It is unclear at the moment if this one will
work with the present driver. As always, if unsure, check
that you can return the card if it doesn't work with the linux
driver <EM>before</EM> paying for the card.</P>

<P>Status: Not Supported.</P>
<P>These 8 bit cards are based on the Fujitsu MB86950, which is an
ancient version of the MB86965 used in the Linux at1700

for the Tiara card (tiara.asm). They are not very common.</P>

<H3>SMC 3016</H3>

<P>Status: Not Supported.</P>
<P>These are 16bit I/O mapped 8390 cards, much similar to a generic

<H2><A NAME="mystery"></A> <A NAME="ss4.52">4.52 Identifying an Unknown Card</A>
</H2>


<P>Okay, so your uncle's cousin's neighbour's friend had a brother
who found an old ISA ethernet card in the AT case he was using as
a cage for his son's pet hampster. Somehow you ended up with
the card and want to try and use it with linux, but nobody
has a clue what the card is and there isn't any documentation.</P>
<P>First of all, look for any obvious model numbers that might
give a clue. Any model number that contains 2000 will most
likely be a NE2000 clone. Any cards with 8003 or 8013
on them somewhere will be Western/Digital WD80x3 cards
or SMC Elite cards or clones of them.</P>

<H3>Identifying the Network Interface Controller</H3>

<P>Look for the biggest chip on the card. This will be the
network controller (NIC) itself, and most can be identified by
the part number. If you know which NIC is on the card, the
following might be able to help you figure out what card it is.</P>
<P>Probably the most common ISA NIC is the National Semiconductor
DP8390 aka NS32490 aka DP83901 aka DP83902 aka DP83905 aka DP83907.
And those are just the ones made by National! Other companies
such as Winbond and UMC make DP8390 and DP83905 clone parts,
such as the Winbond 89c904 (DP83905 clone) and the UMC 9090.
If the card has some form of 8390 on it, then chances are it
is a ne1000 or ne2000 clone card. The second most common 8390
based card are wd80x3 cards and clones. Cards with a DP83905
can be configured to be an ne2000 <EM>or</EM> a wd8013. Never versions
of the genuine wd80x3 and SMC Elite cards have an 83c690 in place
of the original DP8390. The SMC Ultra cards have an 83c790,
and use a slightly different driver than the wd80x3 cards.
The SMC EtherEZ cards have an 83c795, and use the same driver
as the SMC Ultra. All BNC cards based on some sort of 8390 or
8390 clone will usually have an 8392 (or 83c692, or ???392)
16 pin DIP chip very close to the BNC connector.</P>
<P>Another common NIC found on older cards is the Intel i82586.
Cards having this NIC include the 3c505, 3c507, 3c523, Intel
EtherExpress-ISA, Microdyne Exos-205T, and the Racal-Interlan NI5210.</P>
<P>The original AMD LANCE NIC was numbered AM7990, and newer
revisions include the 79c960, 79c961, 79c965, 79c970, and 79c974.
Most cards with one of the above will work with the Linux LANCE
driver, with the exception of the old Racal-Interlan NI6510
cards that have their own driver.</P>
<P>Newer PCI cards having a DEC 21040, 21041, 21140, or similar
number on the NIC should be able to use the linux tulip or
de4x5 driver.</P>
<P>Other PCI cards having a big chip marked RTL8029 or
89C940 or 86C926 are ne2000 clone cards, and the ne2k-pci driver 
should automatically detect these cards.</P>

<H3>Identifying the Ethernet Address</H3>


<P>Each ethernet card has its own six byte address that is
unique to that card. The first three bytes of that address
are the same for each card made by that particular manufacturer.
For example all SMC cards start with <CODE>00:00:c0</CODE>.
The last three are assigned by the manufacturer uniquely to each
individual card as they are produced.</P>
<P>If your card has a sticker on it giving all six bits of its
address, you can look up the vendor from the first three.
However it is more common to see only the last three bytes
printed onto a sticker attached to a socketed PROM,
which tells you nothing.</P>
<P>You can determine which vendors have which assigned addresses
from RFC-1340. Apparently there is a more up to date listing
available in various places as well. Try a WWW or FTP search
for <CODE>EtherNet-codes</CODE> or <CODE>Ethernet-codes</CODE> and you will
find something.</P>

<H3>Identifying the Card by the FCC ID Number</H3>


<P>As part of the certification process a card typically
has to pass before being sold to the user, it gets tested
by the FCC, and from this gets a FCC ID which is supposed
to be printed on the card somewhere. For example, a
card has on it <CODE>FCC ID: J158013EWC</CODE> - and this
card happens to be a SMC/WD8013-EWC. Some web sites
like <CODE>www.driverguide.com</CODE> and <CODE>drdriver.com</CODE>
make use of listings of FCC IDs that may help with less
obvious ID numbers.  The FCC itself has a search tool
that may also help, and it is at:</P>
<P>
<A HREF=" http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid">FCC IDs</A></P>

<H3>Tips on Trying to Use an Unknown Card</H3>


<P>If you are still not sure what the card is, but have at least
narrowed it down some, then you can build a kernel with a
whole bunch of drivers included, and see if any of them
autodetect the card at boot.</P>
<P>If the kernel doesn't detect the card, it may be that the
card is not configured to one of the addresses that the
driver probes when looking for a card. In this case, you
might want to try getting <CODE>scanport.tar.gz</CODE> from your
local linux ftp site, and see if that can locate where your
card is jumpered for. It scans ISA I/O space from <CODE>0x100</CODE>
to <CODE>0x3ff</CODE> looking for devices that aren't registered in
<CODE>/proc/ioports</CODE>. If it finds an unknown device starting
at some particular address, you can then explicity point the
ethernet probes at that address with an <CODE>ether=</CODE> boot
argument.</P>
<P>If you manage to get the card detected, you can then
usually figure out the unknown jumpers by changing them
one at a time and seeing at what I/O base and IRQ that the
card is detected at. The IRQ settings can also usually be
determined by
following the traces on the back of the card to where the
jumpers are soldered through. Counting the `gold fingers'
on the backside, from the end of the card with the metal bracket,
you have IRQ 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 10, 11, 12, 15, 14 at fingers
4, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 respectively.
Eight bit cards only have up to finger 31.</P>
<P>Jumpers that appear to do nothing usually are for selecting
the memory address of an optional boot ROM. Other jumpers that
are located near the BNC or RJ-45 or AUI connectors are usually
to select the output media. These are also typically near
the `black box' voltage converters marked YCL, Valor, or Fil-Mag.</P>

</H2>


<P>There are a few other drivers that are in the linux source
that present an <EM>ethernet-like</EM> device to network
programs, while not really being ethernet. These are briefly
listed here for completeness.</P>
<P><CODE>dummy.c</CODE> - The purpose of this driver is to provide a device
to point a route through, but not to actually transmit packets.</P>
<P><CODE>eql.c</CODE> - Load Equalizer, enslaves multiple devices (usually
modems) and balances the Tx load across them while presenting
a single device to the network programs.</P>
<P><CODE>ibmtr.c</CODE> - IBM Token Ring, which is not really ethernet.
Broken-Ring requires source routing and other uglies.</P>
<P><CODE>loopback.c</CODE> - Loopback device, for which all packets
from your machine and destined for your own machine go.
It essentially just moves the packet off the Tx queue and
onto the Rx queue.</P>
<P><CODE>pi2.c</CODE> - Ottawa Amateur Radio Club PI and PI2 interface.</P>

<H2><A NAME="cable"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Cables, Coax, Twisted Pair</A></H2>

<P>If you are starting a network from scratch, you will probably
be using Cat5 wire for 10/100baseT (twisted pair telco-style cables
with RJ-45 eight wire `phone' connectors).  If you stumble across
some old surplus 10Base2 thin ethernet (RG58 co-ax cable with BNC 
connectors) it might be suitable for linking a few machines
together in a home ethernet.
The old-fashioned thick ethernet, RG5 or RG8 cable with N connectors 
is really obsolete and rarely seen anymore.</P>
<P>See 
<A HREF="#cable-intro">Type of cable...</A> for
an introductory look at cables.
Also note that the FAQ from <EM>comp.dcom.lans.ethernet</EM> has a lot
of useful information on cables and such. FTP to
rtfm.mit.edu and look in <CODE>/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/</CODE>
for the FAQ for that newsgroup.</P>

<H2><A NAME="bnc"></A> <A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Thin Ethernet (thinnet)</A>
</H2>



<P>Thinnet (10Base-2) is pretty much obsolete now.  It is fine for
somebody playing around with a home network and old ISA cards.
There are two main drawbacks to using thinnet. The first is that it
is limited to 10Mb/sec - 100Mb/sec requires twisted pair. The second
drawback is that if you have
a big loop of machines connected together, and some bonehead breaks
the loop by taking one cable off the side of his tee, the whole
network goes down because it sees an infinite impedance (open
circuit) instead of the required 50 ohm termination. Note that
you can remove the tee piece from the card itself without killing
the whole subnet, as long as you don't remove the cables from the
tee itself.  And if you are doing a small
network of two machines, you <EM>still</EM> need the tees and the 50 ohm
terminators -- you <EM>can't</EM> just cable them together!
It is also vital that your cable have no `stubs' -- the `T' 
connectors must be attached directly to the ethercards.</P>


<H2><A NAME="utp"></A> <A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Twisted Pair</A>
</H2>


<P>Twisted pair networks require active hubs,
which start around $50.  You can pretty much ignore
claims that you can use your existing telephone
wiring as it is a rare installation where that turns out to be the
case.</P>
<P>On the other hand, all 100Mb/sec
ethernet proposals use twisted pair, and most new business
installations use twisted pair.  The wiring should be listed
as Category 5.  Anything less than Cat 5 is useless.</P>
<P>If you are only connecting two machines, it is possible to avoid
using a hub by purchasing or making a special cross-over or null 
cable.  But note that some cards that try to sense autonegotiation
and so on expect to be talking to a hub and not another card, and
thus may not work in this configuration.</P>

<H2><A NAME="utils"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Software Configuration and Card Diagnostics</A></H2>


<P>For the oldest (or the cheapest) ISA cards, the card settings 
(I/O, IRQ, output media, etc.) were set by little black
jumper blocks over rows of pins.  As cards got more fancy,
these settings were switched electronically, and the end
user could store the preferred settings in non volatile
memory built into the card.  A vendor supplied program
was used by the end user to alter these settings, removing
the need to open the computer up just to reconfigure a card.</P>
<P>In most cases, if the configuration is done by software,
and stored in an EEPROM, you will usually have to boot
DOS, and use the vendor supplied DOS program to set the cards
IRQ, I/O, mem_addr and whatnot. Besides, hopefully it is
something you will only be setting once. If you don't have
the DOS software for your card, try looking on the WWW site
of your card manufacturer. If you don't know the site name,
take a guess at it, i.e. `www.my_vendor.com' where `my_vendor'
is the name of your card manufacturer. This works for SMC,
3Com, and many <EM>many</EM> other manufacturers.</P>
<P>There are some cards for which Linux versions of
the config utils exist, and they are listed here.
Donald has written a few small card diagnostic
programs that run under Linux. Most of these are a result
of debugging tools that he has created while writing the
various drivers. Don't expect
fancy menu-driven interfaces. You will have to read the
source code to use most of these. Even if your particular
card doesn't have a corresponding diagnostic, you can
still get some information just by typing
<CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE> -- assuming that your card
was at least detected at boot.</P>
<P>In either case, you will have to run most of these programs
as root (to allow I/O to the ports) and you probably want
to shut down the ethercard before doing so by typing
<CODE>ifconfig eth0 down</CODE> first.</P>

<H2><A NAME="config"></A> <A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Configuration Programs for Ethernet Cards</A>
</H2>



<H3>WD80x3 Cards</H3>


<P>For people with wd80x3 cards, there is the program <CODE>wdsetup</CODE>
which can be found in <CODE>wdsetup-0.6a.tar.gz</CODE> on Linux ftp sites.
It is not being actively maintained, and has
not been updated for quite a while. If it works fine for you
then great, if not, use the DOS version that you should have got
with your card. If you don't have the DOS version, you will be
glad to know that the SMC setup/driver disks are available
at SMC's ftp site.
Of course, you <EM>have</EM> to have an EEPROM card to use this utility.
Old, <EM>old</EM> wd8003 cards, and some wd8013 clones use jumpers
to set up the card instead.</P>

<H3>Digital / DEC Cards</H3>


<P>The Digital EtherWorks 3 card can be configured in a similar
fashion to the DOS program <CODE>NICSETUP.EXE</CODE>. David C. Davies
wrote this and other tools for the EtherWorks 3 in conjunction
with the driver. Look on you local linux FTP site in the directory
<CODE>/pub/linux/system/Network/management</CODE> for the file
that is named <CODE>ewrk3tools-X.XX.tar.gz</CODE>.</P>

<H3>NE2000+ or AT/LANTIC Cards</H3>


<P>Some Nat Semi DP83905 implementations (such as the AT/LANTIC
and the NE2000+) are software configurable. (Note that these
cards can also emulate a wd8013 card!) You can get the setup
file <CODE>atlantic.c</CODE> from Donald's ftp
server, <CODE>www.scyld.com</CODE> to configure this card.
In addition, the configuration programs for the Kingston
DP83905 cards seem to work with all cards, as they don't
check for a vendor specific address before allowing you to
use them. Start at the following URL:
<A HREF="http://www.kingston.com/">Kingston</A>
and search for the programs <CODE>20XX12.EXE</CODE> and <CODE>INFOSET.EXE</CODE></P>
<P>Be careful when configuring NE2000+ cards, as you can give
them bad setting values which can cause problems. A typical
example is accidentally enabling the boot ROM in the EEPROM
(even if no ROM is installed) to a setting that conflicts
with the VGA card. The result is a computer that just beeps
at you when you turn it on and nothing appears on the screen.</P>
<P>You can typically
recover from this by doing the following: Remove the card
from the machine, and then boot and enter the CMOS setup.
Change the `Display Adapter' to `Not Installed' and change
the default boot drive to `A:' (your floppy drive).
Also change the `Wait for F1 if any Error' to `Disabled'.
This way, the computer should boot without user intervention.
Now create a bootable DOS floppy (`format a: /s /u') and copy
the program <CODE>default.exe</CODE> from the <CODE>20XX12.EXE</CODE> archive
above onto that floppy. Then
type <CODE>echo default > a:autoexec.bat</CODE>
so that the program to set the card back to sane defaults will
be run automatically when you boot from this floppy.
Shut the machine off, re-install the ne2000+ card, insert your
new boot floppy, and power it back up. It will still probably beep
at you, but eventually you should see the floppy light come on
as it boots from the floppy. Wait a minute or two for the floppy
to stop, indicating that it has finished running the <CODE>default.exe</CODE>
program, and then power down your computer. When you then turn it
on again, you should hopefully have a working display again,
allowing you to change your CMOS settings back, and to change
the card's EEPROM settings back to the values you want.</P>
<P>Note that if you don't have DOS handy, you can do the whole
method above with a linux boot disk that automatically runs
Donald's <CODE>atlantic</CODE> program (with the right command line
switches) instead of a DOS boot disk that automatically runs
the <CODE>default.exe</CODE> program.</P>

<H3>3Com Cards</H3>


<P>The 3Com Etherlink III family of cards (i.e. 3c5x9) can
be configured by using another config utility from Donald.
You can get the file <CODE>3c5x9setup.c</CODE>
from Donald's ftp server, <CODE>www.scyld.com</CODE> to
configure these cards. (Note that the DOS 3c5x9B config
utility may have more options pertaining to the new ``B''
series of the Etherlink III family.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="tech-intro"></A> <A NAME="s7">7. Technical Information</A></H2>


<P>For those who want to understand a bit more about how the card
works, or play with the present drivers, this
information should be useful. If you do not fall into this category,
then perhaps you will want to skip this section.</P>

<H2><A NAME="data-xfer"></A> <A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Programmed I/O vs. Shared Memory vs. DMA</A>
</H2>


<P>If you can already send and receive back-to-back packets, you just
can't put more bits over the wire. Every modern ethercard can receive
back-to-back packets. The Linux DP8390 drivers (wd80x3, SMC-Ultra,
3c503, ne2000, etc) come pretty close to
sending back-to-back packets (depending on the current interrupt
latency) and the 3c509 and AT1500 hardware have no problem at all
automatically sending back-to-back packets.</P>


<H3>Programmed I/O (e.g. NE2000, 3c509)</H3>


<P>Pro: Doesn't use any constrained system resources,
just a few I/O registers, and has no 16M limit.</P>
<P>Con: Usually the slowest transfer rate, the CPU is waiting
the whole time, and interleaved packet access is usually
difficult to impossible.</P>

<H3>Shared memory (e.g. WD80x3, SMC-Ultra, 3c503)</H3>


<P>Pro: Simple, faster than programmed I/O, and allows random
access to packets. Where possible,
the linux drivers compute the checksum of
incoming IP packets as they are copied off the card, resulting in
a further reduction of CPU usage vs. an equivalent PIO card.</P>
<P>Con: Uses up memory space (a big one for DOS users, essentially
a non-issue under Linux), and it still ties up the CPU.</P>

<H3>Bus Master Direct Memory Access (e.g. LANCE, DEC 21040) </H3>


<P>Pro: Frees up the CPU during the data transfer, can string
together buffers, can require little or no CPU time lost on
the ISA bus.  Most of the bus-mastering linux drivers now use
a `copybreak' scheme where large packets are put directly into
a kernel networking buffer by the card, and small packets are
copied by the CPU which primes the cache for subsequent
processing.</P>
<P>Con: (Only applicable to ISA bus cards)
Requires low-memory buffers and a DMA channel for
cards. Any bus-master will have problems with other bus-masters
that are bus-hogs, such as some primitive SCSI adaptors. A few
badly-designed motherboard chipsets have problems with
ISA bus-masters. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Performance Implications of Bus Width</A>
</H2>


<P>The ISA bus can do 5.3MB/sec (42Mb/sec), which sounds like more than
enough for 10Mbps ethernet. In the case of the 100Mbps cards, you
clearly need a faster bus to take advantage of the network bandwidth.
a 33MHz 32 bit PCI bus can do 133MB/sec which isn't enough for GigE.</P>

<H3>ISA Eight bit and ISA 16 bit Cards</H3>


<P>You probably will have a hard time buying a new ISA ethercard
anymore, but you can probably still find some surplus or
obsolete cards suitable for ``home-ethernet'' systems.
If you want to really go retro, you can even use an old
half slot 8 bit ISA card, but note most of them are 10Base-2.</P>
<P>Some 8 bit cards that will provide adequate performance for
light to average use are the wd8003, the 3c503 and the ne1000.
The 3c501 provides poor performance, and these poor 15 year
old relics of the XT days should be avoided. (Send them to
Alan, he collects them...)</P>
<P>The 8 bit data path doesn't hurt performance that much, as you
can still expect to get about 500 to 800kB/s ftp download speed
to an 8 bit wd8003 card (on a fast ISA bus) from a fast host.
And if most of your net-traffic is going to remote sites, then
the bottleneck in the path will be elsewhere, and the only speed
difference you will notice is during net activity on your local
subnet.</P>

<H3>32 Bit PCI (VLB/EISA) Ethernet Cards</H3>


<P>Obviously a 32 bit interface to the computer is a must for
100Mbps and higher networks.  If you get into GigE, then
the 133 megabyte/sec PCI bus (for 33MHz 32 bit PCI) will still
be your limiting factor.</P>
<P>But an older 10Mbs network 
doesn't really  require a 32 bit interface.
See 
<A HREF="#data-xfer">Programmed I/O vs. ...</A> as to why
having a 10Mbps ethercard on an 8MHz ISA bus is really not a
bottleneck. Even though having a slow ethercard on a fast bus won't
necessarily mean faster transfers, it will usually mean reduced
CPU overhead, which is good for multi-user systems.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Performance Implications of Zero Copy</A>
</H2>


<P>As network data is sent or received, you can easily imagine
it being copied to/from the application into kernel memory
and from there being copied to/from the card memory.  All
this data movement takes time and CPU resources.  As hinted
above in the Bus Master DMA section, a properly designed card
can cut down on all this copying, and the most ideal case
would be zero copy of course.  With some of the modern PCI
cards, zero copy is possible by simply pointing the card at
the data and essentially saying "get it yourself."  If maximum
performance with minimum server load is important to you then
check to see if your hardware and driver will support zero copy.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Performance Implications of Hardware Checksums</A>
</H2>


<P>There is no guarantee that your data will travel from 
computer A to computer B without being corrupted.  To
make sure the data is OK, the sender adds up all the
numbers that make up your data, and sends this checksum
along as well. The receiver recomputes this checksum
and compares it to the one the sender computed. If the
two don't match, the receiver knows that the data has
been corrupted and it will reject the bad data.</P>
<P>Computing these sums takes time and extra load on the 
main computer.  Some of the more fancy cards have the
ability to do these Rx and/or Tx sums in hardware, which 
allows the main CPU to offload this task to the card.  </P>
<P>Cards that require a data copy don't benefit as much from 
hardware checksums, since the sum operation can be combined 
into the copy for only a minimal additional overhead.
Hence hardware Tx checksums are only used in zero copy 
(i.e. applications using <CODE>sendfile()</CODE>) situations,
and so hardware Rx checksums are currently more useful.</P>
<P>Note that a reasonable computer can saturate a 100BaseT
link even when doing the copy and checksum itself, so
zerocopy/hw-checksum will only show up as decreased CPU use.
You would have to go to GigE to see a speed increase.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Performance Implications of NAPI (Rx interrupt mitigation)</A>
</H2>


<P>When a card receives a packet from the network, what
usually happens is that the card asks the CPU for attention
by raising an interrupt. Then the CPU determines who caused
the interrupt, and runs the card's driver interrupt handler 
which will in turn read the card's interrupt status to determine 
what the card wanted, and then in this case, run the receive
portion of the card's driver, and finally exits.</P>
<P>Now imagine you are getting lots of Rx data, say 10 thousand
packets per second all the time on some server.  You can
imagine that the above IRQ run-around into and out of the Rx
portion of the driver adds up to a lot of overhead.
A lot of CPU time could be saved by essentially turning off
the Rx interrupt and just hanging around in the Rx portion
of the driver, since it knows there is pretty much a steady
flow of Rx work to do.  This is the basic idea of NAPI.</P>
<P>As of 2.6 kernels, some drivers have a config option to
enable NAPI. There is also some documentation in the 
<CODE>Documentation/networking</CODE> directory that comes with
the kernel.</P>


<H2><A NAME="misc"></A> <A NAME="s8">8. Miscellaneous.</A></H2>


<P>Any other associated stuff that didn't fit in anywhere else gets
dumped here. It may not be relevant, and it may not be of general
interest but it is here anyway.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Transmit FIFO Buffers and Underrun Errors</A>
</H2>

<P>Donald wrote a nice description of what the Tx FIFO does
and when an error occurs. Here it is:</P>
<P>Where the hardware supports it, my drivers have dynamic Tx FIFO
tuning code.  A typical Ethernet chip has a Tx FIFO that holds data 
from the bus before it is transmitted on the wire.  The way this 
FIFO is controlled is important for performance.</P>
<P>Ideally you would like to start transmitting as soon as the first Tx
packet data arrives at the chip.  The "Tx FIFO threshold" is a 
parameter that specifies "start transmitting when N bytes have 
arrived at the NIC chip".  This parameter is initially set for a 
typical configuration.  But if a video card or SCSI controller is 
doing long PCI bursts, the NIC chip will run out of buffered data 
before it can get access to the bus again.  This causes a FIFO 
underrun.</P>
<P>The driver responds to the FIFO underrun by changing the Tx FIFO
threshold to a higher value.  If this happens enough eventually the
chip will end up in store-and-forward mode, where it doesn't start
transmitting until the whole packet has been transferred.</P>
<P>Some designs, such as the Adaptec Starfire, go one step further and
provide an indication that the FIFO almost ran out of data.  This 
allows the driver to tune the setting without risking a Tx error.</P>
<P>It should be rare to see more than one or two Tx FIFO underruns.  
Either the chip has very coarse Tx threshold settings, or the 
driver increases the setting in large chunks to keep the PCI 
bursts on natural boundaries.</P>

<H2><A NAME="lilo"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Passing Ethernet Arguments to the Kernel</A>
</H2>


<P>Here are two generic kernel commands that can be passed to
the kernel at boot time (<CODE>ether</CODE> and <CODE>reserve</CODE>). 
This can be done with LILO, loadlin,
or any other booting utility that accepts optional arguments.</P>
<P>For example, if the command was `blah' and it expected 3 arguments
(say 123, 456, and 789) then, with LILO, you would use:</P>
<P><CODE>LILO: linux blah=123,456,789</CODE></P>
<P>These boot time arguments can be made permanent so that you
don't have to re-enter them every time. Usually this is
as simple as adding <CODE>append="blah=123,456,789"</CODE>
to the top of your <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file. See the LILO
documentation for more details.</P>
<P>For more information on (and a complete list of) boot time
arguments, please see the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html">BootPrompt-HOWTO</A></P>

<H3><A NAME="ether"></A> The <CODE>ether</CODE> command</H3>


<P>The <CODE>ether=</CODE> argument is used in conjunction with
drivers that are directly built into the kernel. The
<CODE>ether=</CODE> argument will have <EM>absolutely no effect</EM>
on a modular driver.  In its most generic form, it 
looks something like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ether=IRQ,BASE_ADDR,PARAM_1,PARAM_2,NAME
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All arguments are optional.  The first non-numeric argument
is taken as the NAME.</P>
<P><B>IRQ:</B>
Obvious.  An IRQ value of `0' (usually the default) means to autoIRQ.
It's a historical accident that the IRQ setting is first rather than
the base_addr -- this will be fixed whenever something else changes.</P>
<P><B>BASE_ADDR:</B>
Also obvious.  A value of `0' (usually the default) means to
probe a card-type-specific address list for an ethercard.</P>
<P><B>PARAM_1:</B>
It was orginally used as an override value for the memory start
for a shared-memory ethercard, like the WD80*3.
Some drivers use the low four bits of this value to set the debug
message level.  0 -- default, 1-7 -- level 1..7, (7 is maximum
verbosity)  8 -- level 0 (no messages). Also, the LANCE driver
uses the low four bits of this value to select the DMA channel.
Otherwise it uses auto-DMA.</P>
<P><B>PARAM_2:</B>
The 3c503 driver uses this to select between the internal and external
transceivers.  0 -- default/internal, 1 -- AUI external.
The Cabletron E21XX card also uses the low 4 bits of PARAM_2 to 
select the output media. Otherwise it detects automatically.</P>
<P><B>NAME:</B>
Selects the network device the values refer to.  The standard kernel
uses the names `eth0', `eth1', `eth2' and `eth3' for bus-attached
ethercards, and `atp0' for the parallel port `pocket' ethernet
adaptor. The arcnet driver uses `arc0' as its name.
The default setting is for a single ethercard to be probed for as
`eth0'.  Multiple cards can only be enabled by explicitly setting up
their base address using these LILO parameters.
The 1.0 kernel has LANCE-based ethercards as a special case.  LILO
arguments are ignored, and LANCE cards are always assigned
`eth&lt;n&gt;' names starting at `eth0'.  Additional non-LANCE ethercards
must be explicitly assigned to `eth&lt;n+1&gt;', and the usual `eth0'
probe disabled with something like  `ether=0,-1,eth0'.
( Yes, this is bug. )</P>

<H3><A NAME="reserve"></A> The <CODE>reserve</CODE> command</H3>


<P>This next lilo command is used just like `ether=' above, ie. it is
appended to the name of the boot select specified in lilo.conf</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
reserve=IO-base,extent{,IO-base,extent...}
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In some machines it may be necessary to prevent device drivers from
checking for devices (auto-probing) in a specific region. This may be
because of poorly designed hardware that causes the boot to <EM>freeze</EM>
(such as some ethercards), hardware that is mistakenly identified,
hardware whose state is changed by an earlier probe, or merely
hardware you don't want the kernel to initialize.</P>
<P>The <CODE>reserve</CODE> boot-time argument addresses this problem by specifying
an I/O port region that shouldn't be probed. That region is reserved
in the kernel's port registration table as if a device has already
been found in that region. Note that this mechanism shouldn't be
necessary on most machines. Only when there is a problem or special
case would it be necessary to use this.</P>
<P>The I/O ports in the specified region are protected against
device probes. This was put in to be used when some driver was
hanging on a NE2000, or misidentifying some other device
as its own.  A correct device driver shouldn't probe a reserved
region, unless another boot argument explicitly specifies that
it do so.  This implies that <CODE>reserve</CODE> will most often be used
with some other boot argument. Hence if you specify a <CODE>reserve</CODE>
region to protect a specific device, you must generally specify
an explicit probe for that device. Most drivers ignore the port
registration table if they are given an explicit address.</P>
<P>For example, the boot line</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
LILO: linux  reserve=0x300,32  ether=0,0x300,eth0
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>keeps all device drivers except the ethercard drivers from
probing 0x300-0x31f.</P>
<P>As usual with boot-time specifiers there is an 11 parameter limit,
thus you can only specify 5 reserved regions per <CODE>reserve</CODE> keyword.
Multiple <CODE>reserve</CODE> specifiers will work if you have an unusually
complicated request.</P>

<H2><A NAME="modules"></A> <A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A>
</H2>


<P>Most of the linux distributions now ship kernels that have
very few drivers built-in.  The drivers are instead supplied as
a bunch of independent dynamically loadable modules.  These
modular drivers are typically loaded by the administrator
with the <CODE>modprobe(8)</CODE> command, or in some cases they are
automatically loaded by the kernel through `kerneld' (in
2.0) or `kmod' (in 2.1) which then calls <CODE>modprobe</CODE>.</P>
<P>Your particular distribution may offer nice graphical
configuration tools for setting up ethernet modules. If possible
you should try and use them first. The description that follows
here gives information on what underlies any fancy configuration
program, and what these programs change.</P>
<P>The information that controls what modules are to be used and
what options are supplied to each module is usually stored in
the file <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>.  The two main options of
interest (for ethernet cards) that will be used in this file
are <CODE>alias</CODE> and <CODE>options</CODE>.  The <CODE>modprobe</CODE> command
consults this file for module information.</P>
<P>The actual modules themselves are typically stored in a directory
named <CODE>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/net</CODE> where the
<CODE>uname -r</CODE> command gives the kernel version (e.g. 2.0.34).
You can look in there to see which module matches your card.</P>
<P>The first thing you need in your <CODE>modules.conf</CODE> file is
something to tell <CODE>modprobe</CODE> what driver to use for the
<CODE>eth0</CODE> (and <CODE>eth1</CODE> and...) network interface.  You
use the <CODE>alias</CODE> command for this.  For example, if you
have an ISA SMC EtherEZ card which uses the <CODE>smc-ultra.o</CODE>
driver module, you need to <CODE>alias</CODE> this driver to <CODE>eth0</CODE>
by adding the line:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        alias eth0 smc-ultra
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Important Note:  The alias above is only used by the module 
utilities to translate a generic device name (e.g.<CODE>eth0</CODE>)
into a hardware specific driver module name.  When the driver
loads, it never even sees this alias; instead it will simply 
choose the first free <CODE>ethN</CODE> (N=0,1,2,...)
device name available. Thus, if more than one ethernet module is
being loaded, the <CODE>ethN</CODE> assigned to the driver by the kernel
may or may not be the same as the one given on the alias line, 
depending on the order in which the modules have been loaded.
If you need to ensure that a particular card is given a particular
IP address, then read the station address and assign your
IP address based upon that.  If you are writing your own shell 
scripts for this, you can just parse the ifconfig output; if
using C, then you would
use <CODE>ioctl(ethfd, SIOCGIFHWADDR, &amp;ifreq)</CODE>.</P>
<P>The other thing you may need is an <CODE>options</CODE> line indicating
what options are to be used with a particular module (or module
alias). Continuing with the above example, if you only used the
single <CODE>alias</CODE> line with no <CODE>options</CODE> line, the kernel would
warn you (see <CODE>dmesg</CODE>) that autoprobing for ISA cards is not
a good idea.  To get rid of this warning, you would add another
line telling the module what I/O base the card is configured to,
in this case say the hexidecimal address <CODE>0x280</CODE> for example.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        options smc-ultra io=0x280
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Most ISA modules accept parameters like <CODE>io=0x340</CODE> and
<CODE>irq=12</CODE> on the <CODE>insmod</CODE> command line. It is <EM>REQUIRED</EM>
or at least <EM>STRONGLY ADVISED</EM> that you supply these parameters
to avoid probing for the card. Unlike PCI and EISA devices,
there is no real safe way to do auto-probing for most ISA devices,
and so it should be avoided when using drivers as modules.</P>
<P>A list of all the options that each module accepts can be
found in the file:</P>
<P><CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt</CODE></P>
<P>It is recommended that you read that to find out what options
you can use for your particular card.
Note that some modules support comma separated value lists for modules
that have the capability to handle multiple devices from a single
module, such as all the 8390 based drivers, and the PLIP driver.
For exmple:</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        options 3c503 io=0x280,0x300,0x330,0x350 xcvr=0,1,0,1
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>The above would have the one module controlling four
3c503 cards, with card 2 and 4 using external
transcievers. Don't put spaces around the `=' or commas.</P>
<P>Also note that a <EM>busy</EM> module can't be removed. That means
that you will have to <CODE>ifconfig eth0 down</CODE>  (shut down the
ethernet card) before you can remove the module(s).</P>
<P>The command <CODE>lsmod</CODE> will show you what modules are
loaded, whether they are in use, and <CODE>rmmod</CODE> will remove them.</P>

</H2>


<P>Much of this info came from saved postings from the comp.os.linux
groups, which shows that it is a valuable resource of information.
Other useful information came from a bunch of small files by Donald
himself. Of course, if you are setting up an Ethernet card,
then you will want to read the NET-2 Howto so that you can actually
configure the software you will use.  Also, if you fancy yourself as
a bit of a hacker, you can always scrounge some additional info
from the driver source files as well. There is usually a paragraph
or two in there describing any important points before any actual
code starts..</P>
<P>For those looking for information that is not specific in any way
to Linux (i.e. what is 10BaseT, what is AUI, what does a hub do, etc.)
I strongly recommend making use of the newsgroup <EM>comp.dcom.lans.ethernet</EM>
and/or <EM>comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.networking</EM>.  Newsgroup archives
such as those at <CODE>dejanews.com</CODE> can also be an invaluable source
of information.
You can grab the newsgroup FAQ from RTFM (which holds all the newsgroup
FAQs) at the following URL:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Closing</A>
</H2>


<P>In the early days of linux, some ten(!) years ago, there
were not a lot of drivers and not a lot of users.  I had
the time to follow individual driver developments, read
about common problems in newsgroups, and answer posted
and e-mailed questions.   Things are a lot different now.
There are a huge number of drivers, and a huge number of
users too, and there is no way I can keep up with each
new development!   This is where I need your help. 
If you have found a new driver that isn't mentioned here,
or any glaring typos, or outdated info in this
document, please send an e-mail. It is big, and it
is easy to overlook stuff. If you have e-mailed about a change,
and it hasn't been included in the next version, please don't
hesitate to send it again, as it might have got lost amongst
the usual sea of SPAM and junk mail I get.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>
