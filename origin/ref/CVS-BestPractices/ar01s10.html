putting together an example of a real world project scenario and show how
exactly will these best practices fit into the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bigger
picture</span>&#8221;</span>.  Also, a lot of readers have told me that the sections on

and <a class="xref" href="ar01s07.html" title="7. Change Propagation">Change Propagation</a> will require examples for better
explanation. Listening to the readers is a Good Thing so I have 
put together a particular project scenario and then create a series of
events to show how the best practices, if followed, would help is making
operations smoother.  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-inception"></a>10.1. Inception</h3></div></div></div><p>Consider a software project where version 1.0 has just been put into
production and everyone is done celebrating.  The next step is to start
working on the new features of the subsequent release.  Also, the users of
the system have started to use it full-time and bug reports of various
levels have started to come in.  </p><p> Before jumping into new enhancements or bug fixes, the best practices
	for <a class="xref" href="ar01s06.html" title="6. Branching and Merging">Branching and Merging</a> should be followed.  Few of
	the important practices are <a class="xref" href="ar01s06.html#section2-tagrelease" title="6.2. Tag each release">Tag each release</a> and
	<a class="xref" href="ar01s06.html#section2-branchatrelease" title="6.3. Create a branch after each release">Create a branch after each release</a>. These practices will
	effectively established two <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">development environments</span>&#8221;</span>,
	one for regular enhancements and the other for bug fixes and minor
	enhancements on the last release.</p><p>Let us assume that the release was tagged as 
</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
<code class="literal">release_1_0</code><br>

</p><p>Then the branch was created with the branch name

enhancements track.  Assume that there are three bugs of which two are of a
high priority that should be fixed right away (possibly within a week) and the
third can be delivered after some time (say after 4 weeks).  In the
middle of this schedule there is a regular release scheduled in three weeks.
Considering that we have a busy month ahead, let us see how exactly we can
use the Best practices to ease the days ahead.</p><p>The timeline for the various release in the next month looks like this.
