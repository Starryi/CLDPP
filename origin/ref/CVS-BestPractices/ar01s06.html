parallel histories.  Changes made on one branch do not affect the other
branches.  Branching can be used extensively to maintain multiple versions
of a product for providing support and new features.  </p><p> Merging converges the branches back to the main trunk.  In a merge,
CVS calculates the changes made on the branch between the point where it
diverged from the trunk and the branch's tip (its most recent state), then
applies those differences to the project at the tip of the trunk.  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-branchowner"></a>6.1. Assign ownership to Trunk and Branches</h3></div></div></div><p>The main trunk of the source tree and the various branches should have a
owner assigned who will be responsible for.  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Keep the list of configurable items for the branch or trunk.
</p><p>The owner will be the maintainer of the contents list for the branch or
trunk.  This list should contain the item name and a brief description about
the item. This list is essential since new artifacts are always added to or
removed from the repository on an ongoing basis.  This list will be able to
track the new additions/deletions to the repository for the respective branch.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Establish a working policy for the branch or trunk.
</p><p>The owner will establish policies for check-in and check-out.  The
policy will define when the code can be checked in (after coding or after
review etc.,).  Who is responsible to merge changes on the same file and
resolve conflicts (the author or the person who recently changed the file).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Identify and document policy deviations
</p><p>Policies once established tend to have exceptions.  The owner will be
responsible for identifying the workaround and tracking/documenting the same
for future use.  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Responsible for merge with the trunk
</p><p>The branch owner will be responsible for ensuring that the changes in
the branch can be successfully merged with the main trunk at a reasonable point
in time. </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-tagrelease"></a>6.2. Tag each release</h3></div></div></div><p>As part of the release process,  the entire code base must be tagged with an
identifier that can help in uniquely identifying the release.  A tag gives a
label to the collection of revisions represented by one developer's working
copy (usually, that working copy is completely up to date so the tag name is
attached to the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">latest and greatest</span>&#8221;</span> revisions in the
repository).  </p><p>The identifier for the tag should provide enough information to
identify the release at any point in time in the future.  One suggested tag
identifier is of the form.  </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
	<code class="literal">release_</code>{major version #}_{minor version #}<br>
</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>As one reader pointed out to me, a good practice here is to tag
the release first. Checkout the entire codebase using the tag, and then
proceed to go through a build / deploy / test process before making the
actual release.  This will absolutely ensure that what <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">leaves the
door </span>&#8221;</span> is a verified and tested codebase.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-branchatrelease"></a>6.3. Create a branch after each release</h3></div></div></div><p>After each software release, once the CVS repository is tagged, a
branch has to be immediately created.  This branch will serve as the bug fix
baseline for that release.  This branch is created only if the release is
not a bug fix or patch release in the first place.  Patches that have to be
made for this release at any point in time in the future will be developed
on this branch.  The main trunk will be used for ongoing product
development.  </p><p>With this arrangement, the changes in the code for the ongoing
development will be on the main trunk and the branch will provide a separate
partition for hot fixes and bug fix releases.  </p><p>The identifier for the branch name can be of the form.  </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
<code class="literal">release_</code>{major version #}_{minor version #}<code class="literal">_patches</code><br>
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-bugfixbranches"></a>6.4. Make bug fixes to branches only</h3></div></div></div><p>This practice extends from the previous practice of creating a
separate branch after a major release.  The branch will serve as the code
base for all bug fixes and patch release that have to be made.  Thus, there
is a separate repository <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sandbox</span>&#8221;</span> where the hot fixes and
patches can be developed apart from the mainstream development. </p><p>This practice also ensures that bug fixes done to previous releases do
not mysteriously affect the mainstream version.   In addition, new features
added to the mainstream version do not creep into the patch release
accidentally.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-patchesfrombranches"></a>6.5. Make patch releases from branches only</h3></div></div></div><p>Since all the bug fixes for a given release are done on its
corresponding branch, the patch releases are made from the branch.  This
ensures that there is no confusion on the feature set that is released as
part of the patch release.  </p><p>After the patch release is made, the branch has to be tagged using the
	release tagging practice (see <a class="xref" href="ar01s06.html#section2-tagrelease" title="6.2. Tag each release">Tag each release</a>).  </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5. CVS Server Configuration </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7. Change Propagation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
