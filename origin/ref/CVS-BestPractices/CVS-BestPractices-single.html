tool that is now being looked at seriously by many commercial organizations as
a viable alternative to other commercial Software configuration management tools.  </p><p>This spotlight on CVS has led to the inevitable question of best
practices for deploying CVS as the backbone SCM tool for large
software development projects.  Having answered this question many times
verbally as a bunch of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">gotchas</span>&#8221;</span> on CVS, it was time to put
down on paper some of the best practices that will work well for  
CVS based projects.  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the

There has also been a slew of GUI client applications that can
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">talk</span>&#8221;</span> to a CVS server.  These GUI clients provide a
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">point and click</span>&#8221;</span> interface to the CVS repository. 
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-useguiclient"></a>3.1. Use GUI CVS client</h3></div></div></div><p> This paper recommends using such GUI clients during the initial
deployment of CVS in an organization.</p><p>Developers typically use integrated development environments that have
the CM tools integrated into them.  These tools minimize the learning for the
developers about the intricacies of CVS usage and instead allow them to be
productive from day one.  Developers who are accustomed to other CM tools will
find the CVS command-line interface daunting.  The adoption and usage of
CVS can be improved by using GUI tools for CVS clients.  </p><p> GUI tools for CVS are available at <a class="ulink" href="http://cvsgui.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://cvsgui.sourceforge.net/</a>.
GUI interfaces are available for most of the popular platforms (Windows, Mac
and Linux).  In addition, on the Windows platform there is an
<acronym class="acronym">SCC</acronym> extension that allows integration of CVS as the
configuration control tool with popular IDE.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-devsandbox"></a>4. Developer Sandbox</h2></div></div></div><p>The developer <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sandbox</span>&#8221;</span> is where each developer keeps his
or her working copy of the code base.  In CVS this is referred to as the
working directory.  This is where they build, test and debug the modules that
they are working on.  A sandbox can also be the area where the staging build
or the production build is done.  Changes made in the work area are checked
into the CVS repository.  In addition, changes made in the repository by
others have to be updated in the sandbox on a regular basis.  </p><p>The best practices related to developers sandbox are:
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-clockinsync"></a>4.1. Keep System clocks in Sync</h3></div></div></div><p>CVS tracks change to source files by using the timestamp on the
file.  If each client system  date and time is not in sync, there is a
definite possibility of CVS getting confused.  Thus system clocks must be
kept in sync by use of a central time server or similar mechanism.  
</p><p>CVS is designed from ground up to handle multiple timezones.  As
long as the host operating system has been setup and configured correctly,
CVS will be able to track changes correctly.  
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-dontshare"></a>4.2. Do not share the sandbox</h3></div></div></div><p>Sandboxes have to be unique for each developer or purpose.  They
should not be used for multiple things at the same time.  A sandbox can be a
working area for a developer or the build area for the final release.  If
such sandboxes are shared, then the owner of the sandbox will not be aware
of the changes made to the files resulting in confusion.  </p><p>In CVS, the sandbox is created automatically when a working copy is
checked out for a CVS project using the <span class="command"><strong>cvs checkout
{project-name}</strong></span> command.  </p><p>In very large projects, it does not make sense for the developers to
check-out the entire source into the local sandbox.  In such cases, they can
take the binaries generated by the build team on a regular basis for all those
components of the application that is not changed by them and only check-out
the parts that are built by the developer.  </p><p>For example, in a Java project, the build team can keep the results of
their last successful build in a standard location in the form of JAR files on
the network file servers.  Individual developers will use a standard classpath
setup that has the network drives mounted on standard paths.  Thus, the
developers will automatically get the latest version of the files as required
by them.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-syncup"></a>4.3. Stay in sync with the repository</h3></div></div></div><p>To gain the benefits of working within a sandbox as mentioned above,
the developer must keep his or her sandbox in sync with the main repository.
A regular <span class="command"><strong>cvs update</strong></span> with the appropriate tag or branch
name will ensure that the sandboxes are kept up to date.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-workinside"></a>4.4. Do not work outside the sandbox</h3></div></div></div><p>The sandbox can be thought of as a controlled area within which CVS
   can track for changes made to the various source files.  Files belonging to
   other developers will be automatically updated by CVS in the developer's
   sandbox.  Thus the developer who lives within the sandbox will stand to gain
   a lot of benefits of concurrent development. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-cleanupatcompletion"></a>4.5. Cleanup after Completion</h3></div></div></div><p>Make sure that the sandbox is cleaned up after completion of work on
the files.  Cleanup can be done in CVS by using the <span class="command"><strong>cvs
release</strong></span> command.  This ensures that no old version of the files
exists in the development sandbox.  As explained previously, pre-built
binaries from the build team can be used to ensure that all the parts of the
application are available to the developer without the need for a complete
compilation in the sandbox.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-checkin"></a>4.6. Check-in Often</h3></div></div></div><p>To help other developers keep their code in sync with your code, you
must check-in your code often into the CVS repository.  The best
practice would be to check-in soon as a piece of code is completed, reviewed
and tested, check-in the changes with <span class="command"><strong>cvs commit</strong></span> to
ensure that your changes are committed to the CVS repository.  </p><p> CVS promotes concurrent development.  Concurrent development is
possible only if all the other developers are aware of the ongoing changes
on a regular basis.  This awareness can be termed as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">situation
awareness</span>&#8221;</span> </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>One of the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bad</span>&#8221;</span> practices that commonly occur
is the sharing of files between developers by email.  This works against
most of the best practices mentioned above.  To share updates between two
developers, CVS must be used as the communication medium.  This will
ensure that CVS is <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">aware</span>&#8221;</span> of the changes and can track
them.  Thus, audit trail can be established if necessary.  </p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-serverconfig"></a>5. CVS Server Configuration</h2></div></div></div><p>This section deals with best practices for CVS server side setup and

      ability to have access control for files/folders/branches etc., within
      the CVS repository for various users.  Unfortunately CVS does not
      come with a built in Access control capability but it does support a
      rudimentary form of access control through the readers/writers files in
      the CVSROOT repository.  I have put together a set of scripts that use
      the readers/writers files to provide a slightly useable version of access
      control.  This is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://cvspermissions.sarovar.org" target="_top">http://cvspermissions.sarovar.org</a>
      as an Open Source project.  Feel free to use it and let me know how it
      works for you.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-scripting"></a>5.2. Server side scripting</h3></div></div></div><p>Server side scripting refers  to the ability to make CVS server
	execute certain scripts when an event occurs.  A common script that
	helps is to verify that all cvs commits contain acomment entered by the
	developer.  The process involves setting up the
	<code class="filename">CVSROOT/verifymsg</code> file to run a script when a file is
	checked-in.  </p><pre class="programlisting">

of a commit happening.  This can be used to verify whether commits are
occurring during the course of a daily/release build.  If such commits
occur, based on the project policy, the commits can be ignored or the entire
build automatically restarted.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-branchmerge"></a>6. Branching and Merging</h2></div></div></div><p> Branching in CVS splits a project's development into separate,
parallel histories.  Changes made on one branch do not affect the other
branches.  Branching can be used extensively to maintain multiple versions
of a product for providing support and new features.  </p><p> Merging converges the branches back to the main trunk.  In a merge,
CVS calculates the changes made on the branch between the point where it
diverged from the trunk and the branch's tip (its most recent state), then
applies those differences to the project at the tip of the trunk.  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-branchowner"></a>6.1. Assign ownership to Trunk and Branches</h3></div></div></div><p>The main trunk of the source tree and the various branches should have a
owner assigned who will be responsible for.  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Keep the list of configurable items for the branch or trunk.
</p><p>The owner will be the maintainer of the contents list for the branch or
trunk.  This list should contain the item name and a brief description about
the item. This list is essential since new artifacts are always added to or
removed from the repository on an ongoing basis.  This list will be able to
track the new additions/deletions to the repository for the respective branch.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Establish a working policy for the branch or trunk.
</p><p>The owner will establish policies for check-in and check-out.  The
policy will define when the code can be checked in (after coding or after
review etc.,).  Who is responsible to merge changes on the same file and
resolve conflicts (the author or the person who recently changed the file).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Identify and document policy deviations
</p><p>Policies once established tend to have exceptions.  The owner will be
responsible for identifying the workaround and tracking/documenting the same
for future use.  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Responsible for merge with the trunk
</p><p>The branch owner will be responsible for ensuring that the changes in
the branch can be successfully merged with the main trunk at a reasonable point
in time. </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-tagrelease"></a>6.2. Tag each release</h3></div></div></div><p>As part of the release process,  the entire code base must be tagged with an
identifier that can help in uniquely identifying the release.  A tag gives a
label to the collection of revisions represented by one developer's working
copy (usually, that working copy is completely up to date so the tag name is
attached to the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">latest and greatest</span>&#8221;</span> revisions in the
repository).  </p><p>The identifier for the tag should provide enough information to
identify the release at any point in time in the future.  One suggested tag
identifier is of the form.  </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
	<code class="literal">release_</code>{major version #}_{minor version #}<br>
</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>As one reader pointed out to me, a good practice here is to tag
the release first. Checkout the entire codebase using the tag, and then
proceed to go through a build / deploy / test process before making the
actual release.  This will absolutely ensure that what <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">leaves the
door </span>&#8221;</span> is a verified and tested codebase.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-branchatrelease"></a>6.3. Create a branch after each release</h3></div></div></div><p>After each software release, once the CVS repository is tagged, a
branch has to be immediately created.  This branch will serve as the bug fix
baseline for that release.  This branch is created only if the release is
not a bug fix or patch release in the first place.  Patches that have to be
made for this release at any point in time in the future will be developed
on this branch.  The main trunk will be used for ongoing product
development.  </p><p>With this arrangement, the changes in the code for the ongoing
development will be on the main trunk and the branch will provide a separate
partition for hot fixes and bug fix releases.  </p><p>The identifier for the branch name can be of the form.  </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
<code class="literal">release_</code>{major version #}_{minor version #}<code class="literal">_patches</code><br>
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-bugfixbranches"></a>6.4. Make bug fixes to branches only</h3></div></div></div><p>This practice extends from the previous practice of creating a
separate branch after a major release.  The branch will serve as the code
base for all bug fixes and patch release that have to be made.  Thus, there
is a separate repository <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">sandbox</span>&#8221;</span> where the hot fixes and
patches can be developed apart from the mainstream development. </p><p>This practice also ensures that bug fixes done to previous releases do
not mysteriously affect the mainstream version.   In addition, new features
added to the mainstream version do not creep into the patch release
accidentally.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-patchesfrombranches"></a>6.5. Make patch releases from branches only</h3></div></div></div><p>Since all the bug fixes for a given release are done on its
corresponding branch, the patch releases are made from the branch.  This
ensures that there is no confusion on the feature set that is released as
part of the patch release.  </p><p>After the patch release is made, the branch has to be tagged using the
	release tagging practice (see <a class="xref" href="#section2-tagrelease" title="6.2. Tag each release">Tag each release</a>).  </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-chgpropagation"></a>7. Change Propagation</h2></div></div></div><p>Change propagation practices explore how changes made to one version of
the application are migrated to other living versions of the application.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-mergebugfix"></a>7.1. Merge branch with the trunk after release</h3></div></div></div><p>After each release from a branch, the changes made to the branch
should be merged with the trunk.  This ensures that all the bug fixes made
to the patch release are properly incorporated into future releases of the
application.  </p><p>This merge could potentially be time consuming depending on the amount
of changes made to the trunk and the branch being merged.  In fact, it will
probably result in a lot of conflicts in CVS resulting in manual merges.
After the merge, the trunk code base must be tested to verify that the
application is in proper working order.  This must be kept in mind while
preparing the project schedule.  </p><p>In the case of changes occurring on branches for a long period,
these changes can be merged to the main branch on a regular basis even
before the release is made.  The frequency of merge is done based on certain
logical points in the branch's evolution.  To ensure that duplicate merging
does not occur, the following practice can be adopted.  </p><p>In addition to the branch tag, a tag called {branch_name}_MERGED
should be created.  This is initially at the same level as the last release
tag for the branch.  This tag is then <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">moved</span>&#8221;</span> after each
intermediate merge by using the <span class="command"><strong>-F</strong></span> option.  This
eliminates duplicate merging issues during intermediate merges.  </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-softwarebuild"></a>8. Software Builds</h2></div></div></div><p>This section deals with the best practices for software builds.  Build
is the process of creating the application binaries for a software release.
They are done in a periodic manner by the build teams to provide baseline
binaries for daily work.  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-bebo"></a>8.1. Build Early and Build Often (<acronym class="acronym">BEBO</acronym>) </h3></div></div></div><p>A variation of this adage has been around in the Open Source
community called "Release Early and Release Often" for quite some time
albeit for a different reason.  BEBO helps a development team identify
issues that can arise from checking in the wrong files.  BEBO will address
integration issues at the application level that might have slipped passed
individual developer builds.  It will also improve the team morale when they
see a working version of the application.</p><p>Builds must be done on a regular basis.  There should be a dedicated
resource(s) assigned to do the same.  The entire project team must be
trained to view the daily build as an important activity and not as a chore.
Builds must be completed without any failures on a regular basis.  Build
failures must be a rare event and should be treated with utmost seriousness.
The project team should ensure that successful builds are top priority on
their agenda.  The seriousness can be emphasised by setting up a penalty for
breaking the build.  </p><p>Each build can be tagged in CVS using a standard naming convention.
This can help developers checkout a working version of the entire system
from daily builds for local development.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-automate"></a>8.2. Automate build Process completely</h3></div></div></div><p>Another key practice for software builds is to automate the build
process completely.  The automation process must also include automatic
retrieval of the right source files from the CVS repository.  This
ensures that the build process is completely repeatable and consistent.  In
addition, the chances of a build with the wrong version of the application
source files are reduced to a large degree.  </p><p>By automating the build process, the task of building often becomes
less burdensome.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-ensurecheckin"></a>8.3. All necessary files must be checked-in  before build</h3></div></div></div><p>This adage sounds trivial at first but this problem is very common
even with experienced development teams due to oversight.  The problem of
oversight cannot be easily addressed since the onus is on the individual
developer to ensure that his or her file has been checked in.  This practice
should be drummed into the team in the form of training and pre-build
announcements to ensure that the right version of source code is available
in the repository.  </p><p>Automated build process as explained above will help in catching this
problem to a certain degree since they will automatically take the source
code from the CVS repository and perform the software build.  Any missed
items will surface during the build process itself (makefiles etc.,) or
during the regression testing of the product (older version of the file
checked in).  </p><p>A penalty based system can be setup to handle wrong check-in.  Having a
kitty for a post project party to which each person who makes a wrong check-in
will contribute a fixed amount will act a good penalty system.  </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-instprocess"></a>9. Institutionalize CVS in the Organization</h2></div></div></div><p>Here we will look at the best practices for institutionalizing CVS
usage in the organization.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-chngmgmt"></a>9.1. Implement Change Management Process</h3></div></div></div><p>All organizations must implement a good Change management process
(<acronym class="acronym">CMP</acronym>).  A good CMP will define how changes are received, 
recorded, tracked, executed and delivered.  CVS provides version
control for your project.  Change management addresses the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bigger
picture</span>&#8221;</span> of how enhancements and bugs are received, tracked and
closed.  CVS will play a smaller but a very important part in this
entire picture.  With a formal change management process in place in the
organization, tools such as CVS will be looked at as aiding this process
instead of acting as a general development overhead.  </p><p>Change management is quite a vast topic that cannot be done justice
here.  Please look up other sources of information on change management.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-objectives"></a>9.2. Make CVS Usage part of Objectives</h3></div></div></div><p>To institutionalize CVS, it can be made as part of the performance
objectives for the developer to use CVS in the project.  In addition, it
can also be made as part of the objective for the project manager to deploy
CVS in his or her project.  </p><p>Compliance of this can then be reviewed as part of the appraisal cycle
for the employee.  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-metrics"></a>9.3. Collect metrics on CVS usage</h3></div></div></div><p>CVS usage metrics can be collected in terms of percentage of
deployment in the organization,  project size handled etc., This information
will spur other line managers and program managers to look at CVS as a
tool that will aid them in their daily operations.  </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section1-inaction"></a>10. Best Practices in Action</h2></div></div></div><p>The best way to explain the need for these best practices is by
putting together an example of a real world project scenario and show how
exactly will these best practices fit into the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">bigger
picture</span>&#8221;</span>.  Also, a lot of readers have told me that the sections on

and <a class="xref" href="#section1-chgpropagation" title="7. Change Propagation">Change Propagation</a> will require examples for better
explanation. Listening to the readers is a Good Thing so I have 
put together a particular project scenario and then create a series of
events to show how the best practices, if followed, would help is making
operations smoother.  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section2-inception"></a>10.1. Inception</h3></div></div></div><p>Consider a software project where version 1.0 has just been put into
production and everyone is done celebrating.  The next step is to start
working on the new features of the subsequent release.  Also, the users of
the system have started to use it full-time and bug reports of various
levels have started to come in.  </p><p> Before jumping into new enhancements or bug fixes, the best practices
	for <a class="xref" href="#section1-branchmerge" title="6. Branching and Merging">Branching and Merging</a> should be followed.  Few of
	the important practices are <a class="xref" href="#section2-tagrelease" title="6.2. Tag each release">Tag each release</a> and

middle of this schedule there is a regular release scheduled in three weeks.

    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the

    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm456"></a>3. Copying in Quantity</h2></div></div></div><p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm462"></a>4. Modifications</h2></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</p></li></ol></div><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm498"></a>5. Combining Documents</h2></div></div></div><p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm503"></a>6. Collections of Documents</h2></div></div></div><p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm507"></a>7. Aggregation with Independent Works</h2></div></div></div><p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm511"></a>8. Translation</h2></div></div></div><p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm514"></a>9. Termination</h2></div></div></div><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm517"></a>10. Future Revisions of this License</h2></div></div></div><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm522"></a>. How to use this License for your documents</h2></div></div></div><p>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.

      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</p></blockquote></div><p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</p><p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
