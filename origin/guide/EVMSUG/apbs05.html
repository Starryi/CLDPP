RAID regions can be resized in order to expand or shrink the available
data space in the region.
Each RAID level has different characteristics, and thus each RAID level
has different requirements for when and how they can expand or shrink.
</p><p>
See <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Expanding and shrinking volumes">Chapter 16, <i>Expanding and shrinking volumes</i></a> for general information about
resizing EVMS volumes and objects.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="linear"></a>5.1. Linear</h3></div></div></div><p>
A Linear-RAID region can be expanded in two ways.
First, if the last child object in the Linear-RAID region is
expandable, then that object can be expanded, and the RAID region
can expand into that new space.
Second, one or more new objects can be added to the end of the region.
</p><p>
Likewise, a Linear-RAID region can be shrunk in two ways.
If the last child object in the region is shrinkable, then that object
can be shrunk, and the RAID region will shrink by the same amount.
Also, one or more objects can be removed from the end of the RAID
region (but the first object in the region cannot be removed).
</p><p>
Linear-RAID regions can be resized while they are active and in use.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="resizeraid0"></a>5.2. RAID-0</h3></div></div></div><p>
You can expand a RAID-0 region by adding one new object to the region.
You can shrink a RAID-0 region by removing up to N-1 of the current
child objects in a region with N objects.
</p><p>
Because RAID-0 regions stripe across the child objects, when a RAID-0
region is resized, the data must be "re-striped" to account for the new
number of objects.
This means the MD plug-in will move each chunk of data from its
location in the current region to the appropriate location in the
expanded region.
Be forewarned, the re-striping process can take a long time.
At this time, there is no mechanism for speeding up or slowing down
the re-striping process.
The EVMS GUI and text-mode user interface will indicate the progress
of the re-striping.
Please do not attempt to interrupt the re-striping before it is
complete, because the data in the RAID-0 region will likely become
corrupted.
</p><p>
RAID-0 regions must be deactivated before they are resized in order to
prevent data corruption while the data is being re-striped.
</p><p>
IMPORTANT: Please have a suitable backup available before attempting
a RAID-0 resize.  If the re-striping process is interrupted before it
completes (for example, the EVMS process gets killed, the machine
crashes, or a child object in the RAID region starts returning I/O
errors), then the state of that region cannot be ensured in all situations.
</p><p>
EVMS will attempt to recover following a problem during a RAID-0 resize.
The MD plug-in does keep track of the progress of the resize in the MD
metadata.
Each time a data chunk is moved, the MD metadata is updated to
reflect which chunk is currently being processed.
If EVMS or the machine crashes during a resize, the next time you run
EVMS the MD plug-in will try to restore the state of that region based
on the latest metadata information.
If an expand was taking place, the region will be "rolled back" to its
state before the expand.
If a shrink was taking place, the shrink will continue from the
point it stopped.
However, this recovery is not always enough to ensure that the entire
volume stack is in the correct state.
If the RAID-0 region is made directly into a volume, then it will
likely be restored to the correct state.
On the other hand, if the RAID region is a consumed-object in an
LVM container, or a child-object of another RAID region, then the
metadata for those plug-ins might not always be in the correct state
and might be at the wrong location on the RAID region.
Thus, the containers, objects, and volumes built on top of the RAID-0
region might not reflect the correct size and might not even be discovered.

A RAID-1 region can be resized if all of the child objects can be
simultaneously resized by the same amount.
</p><p>
RAID-1 regions cannot be resized by adding additional objects.
This type of operation is referred to as "adding active objects," and
is discussed in <a class="xref" href="apbs03.html#addactobjsr1" title="3.3. Adding active objects to RAID-1">Section 3.3, &#8220;Adding active objects to RAID-1&#8221;</a>.
</p><p>
RAID-1 regions must be deactivated before they are resized.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="resizeRAID-45"></a>5.4. RAID-4/5</h3></div></div></div><p> 
Resizing a RAID-4/5 region follows the same rules and restrictions 
for resizing a RAID-0 region.  Expand a RAID-4/5 region by 
adding one new object to the region.   
Shrink a RAID-4/5 region by removing up to N-1 of the current child objects in a region
with N objects. 
</p><p> 
See <a class="xref" href="apbs05.html#resizeraid0" title="5.2. RAID-0">Section 5.2, &#8220;RAID-0&#8221;</a> for information about how to perform this function.
</p><p>
Like RAID-0, RAID-4/5 regions must be deactivated before they are resized.
