		create abstractions of the layer or layers below. EVMS also allows most plug-ins
		to create abstractions of objects within the same layer. The following
		list defines these layers from the bottom up.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Device managers</span></dt><dd><p>The first (bottom) layer consists
			of device managers.
			These plug-ins communicate with hardware device drivers to
			create the first EVMS objects. Currently, all devices are handled by a single plug-in.
			Future releases of EVMS might need additional device managers
			for network device management (for example, to manage
			disks on a storage area network (SAN)).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Segment managers</span></dt><dd><p>The second layer consists of segment 
			managers. These plug-ins
			 handle the segmenting, or partitioning,
			of disk drives. The Engine components can replace partitioning
			programs, such as <span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> and
			<span class="application">Disk Druid</span>, and EVMS
			uses Device Mapper to replace the in-kernel disk
			partitioning code. 
			Segment managers can also be "stacked," meaning that 
			one segment manager
			can take as input the output from another segment 
			manager.</p><p> EVMS provides the following segment managers: 
			DOS, GPT, System/390® (S/390), Cluster, BSD,
			Mac, and BBR. Other segment manager
			plug-ins can be added to support other 
			partitioning schemes.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Region managers</span></dt><dd><p>The third layer consists of region 
			managers. 
			This layer provides a place for plug-ins that ensure
			compatibility with existing volume management schemes 
			in Linux and other operating systems. 
			Region managers are intended to model systems that 
			provide a logical abstraction above disks
			or partitions.</p><p>Like segment managers, region managers can 
			also be stacked. 
			Therefore, the input object(s) to a region manager can
			be disks, segments, or other regions.</p><p>There are currently three region manager plug-ins in EVMS: 
			Linux LVM, LVM2, and Multi-Disk (MD).
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Linux LVM</span></dt><dd><p>The Linux LVM plug-in provides compatibility with
				the Linux LVM and allows the creation of volume groups 
				(known in EVMS as containers) and logical volumes 
				(known in EVMS as regions). </p></dd><dt><span class="term">LVM2</span></dt><dd><p>
				The LVM2 plug-in provides compatibility with the
new volume format introduced by the LVM2 tools from Red Hat.  This plug-in
is very similar in functionality to the LVM plug-in.  The primary difference
is the new, improved metadata format.	
				</p></dd><dt><span class="term">MD</span></dt><dd><p>The Multi-Disk (MD) plug-in for RAID provides 
				RAID levels linear, 0, 1, 4, and 5 in 
				software. MD is one plug-in that displays as four region
				managers that you can choose from.</p></dd></dl></div></dd><dt><span class="term">EVMS features</span></dt><dd><p>The next layer consists of EVMS 
			features. This layer is
			where new EVMS-native functionality is implemented. EVMS
			features can be built on any object in the system, including
			disks, segments, regions, or other feature objects. 
			All EVMS features share a common type of metadata, 
			which makes discovery of feature objects much more 
			efficient, and recovery
			of broken features objects much more reliable. There are three 
			features currently available in EVMS: drive linking, Bad 
			Block Relocation, and snapshotting. </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Drive Linking</span></dt><dd><p>Drive linking allows any
			number of objects to be linearly concatenated together into a
			single object. A drive linked volume can be expanded by 
			adding another storage object to the end or shrunk by removing the last object.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Bad Block Relocation</span></dt><dd><p>Bad Block Relocation (BBR)
			monitors its I/O path and detects write failures (which can be
			caused by a damaged disk). In the event of such a failure, the
			data from that request is stored in a new location. BBR keeps
			track of this remapping. Additional I/Os to that
			location are redirected to the new location.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Snapshotting</span></dt><dd><p>The Snapshotting feature provides
			a mechanism for creating a "frozen" copy of a volume at a single
			instant in time, without having to take that volume off-line.
			This is useful for performing backups on a live system.
			Snapshots work with any volume (EVMS or compatibility), and can
			use any other available object as a backing store. After a
			snapshot is created and made into an EVMS volume, writes to the "original" volume cause the
			original contents of that location to be copied to the snapshot's
			storage object. Reads to the snapshot volume look like they
			come from the original at the time the snapshot was created.
</p></dd></dl></div></dd><dt><span class="term">File System Interface Modules</span></dt><dd><p>File System Interface Modules (FSIMs) 
			provide coordination with the
			file systems during certain volume management 
			operations. For
			instance, when expanding or shrinking a volume, 
			the file system
			must also be expanded or shrunk to the appropriate size.
			Ordering in this example is also important; 
			a file system cannot
			be expanded before the volume, and a volume cannot 
			be shrunk before the file system. 
			The FSIMs allow EVMS to ensure this
			coordination and ordering.</p><p>FSIMs also perform file system
			operations from one of the EVMS user interfaces. For instance,
			a user can make new file systems and check existing file systems
			by interacting with the FSIM.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cluster Manager Interface Modules</span></dt><dd><p>Cluster Manager Interface Modules, also
		known as the EVMS Clustered Engine (ECE), interface
		with the local cluster manager installed on the system.
		The ECE provides a standardized ECE API to the Engine
		while hiding cluster manager details from the Engine.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4. What makes EVMS so flexible? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Using the EVMS interfaces</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
