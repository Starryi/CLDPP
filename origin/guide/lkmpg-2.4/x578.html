			it.</P
><P
>Now the question is, how do you get a major number without hijacking one that's already in use?  The easiest way
			would be to look through <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Documentation/devices.txt</TT
> and pick an unused one.  That's a bad way of doing
			things because you'll never be sure if the number you picked will be assigned later.  The answer is that you can ask the
			kernel to assign you a dynamic major number.</P
><P
>If you pass a major number of 0 to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>register_chrdev</CODE
>, the return value will be the dynamically
			allocated major number.  The downside is that you can't make a device file in advance, since you don't know what the major
			number will be.  There are a couple of ways to do this.  First, the driver itself can print the newly assigned number and
			we can make the device file by hand.  Second, the newly registered device will have an entry in
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/devices</TT
>, and we can either make the device file by hand or write a shell script to read the
			file in and make the device file.  The third method is we can have our driver make the device file using the
			<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>mknod</CODE
> system call after a successful registration and rm during the call to
			<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cleanup_module</CODE

>We can't allow the kernel module to be <SPAN

>'ed whenever root feels like it.  If the
			device file is opened by a process and then we remove the kernel module, using the file would cause a call to the memory
			location where the appropriate function (read/write) used to be.  If we're lucky, no other code was loaded there, and
			we'll get an ugly error message.  If we're unlucky, another kernel module was loaded into the same location, which means a
			jump into the middle of another function within the kernel.  The results of this would be impossible to predict, but they
			can't be very positive.</P
><P
>Normally, when you don't want to allow something, you return an error code (a negative number) from the function
			which is supposed to do it.  With <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

			However, there's a counter which keeps track of how many processes are using your module.  You can see what it's value is
			by looking at the 3rd field of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/modules</TT

CLASS="FUNCTION"

>The system calls, which are the major interface the kernel shows to the processes, generally stay the same across
			versions. A new system call may be added, but usually the old ones will behave exactly like they used to. This is
			necessary for backward compatibility -- a new kernel version is not supposed to break regular processes. In most cases,
			the device files will also remain the same. On the other hand, the internal interfaces within the kernel can and do change
			between versions.</P
><P
>The Linux kernel versions are divided between the stable versions (n.$&#60;$even number$&#62;$.m) and the development
			versions (n.$&#60;$odd number$&#62;$.m). The development versions include all the cool new ideas, including those which will
			be considered a mistake, or reimplemented, in the next version. As a result, you can't trust the interface to remain the
			same in those versions (which is why I don't bother to support them in this book, it's too much work and it would become
			dated too quickly). In the stable versions, on the other hand, we can expect the interface to remain the same regardless
			of the bug fix version (the m number).</P
