  communicate news, mostly serves print-based media such as
  newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Pitching stories for
  television and radio will be somewhat different.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="print_based_media"></a>5.1. Print-based Media</h3></div></div></div><p>Every publication has a lead time for accepting releases
  and pitches. Generally, daily and weekly newspapers have quite
  short lead times, while monthly or quarterly magazines may have a
  lead time of several months. Each publication will also have
  requirements regarding text and graphic formats. For instance,
  they may accept only plain-text documents with no formatting or
  require graphical files (such as photos) to be submitted in a
  particular file type and resolution.</p><p>Although you do not need to become an expert in desktop
  publishing and print production, having a general knowledge of
  these areas will be extremely beneficial. Familiarize yourself
  with commonly used text formats (such as Microsoft Word for print
  and HTML for the Internet) and graphical formats (such as eps,
  jpeg, and gif). For important communications, you may wish to
  engage the services of a copy editor, graphic designer, or other
  publishing professional.</p><p>The Internet today works similarly to the print media.
  Speed is paramount for this medium. News can be posted
  immediately, without waiting for the printing presses to roll.
  Space limitations are not as much of a concern as they are for
  print, and the online edition will often publish stories that do
  not fit in the printed edition.</p><p>Naturally, online editors prefer to receive your news
  electronically. Targeting the right online editors can result in
  almost immediate posting of your news. Be sure to build
  relationships with online editors as you would for print editors.
  The online world is a growing segment that you simply cannot
  afford to ignore.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tv_radio"></a>5.2. Television and Radio</h3></div></div></div><p>Studies show that television has replaced newspapers as the
  primary medium from which people get their news. These studies
  also found that TV news had a much higher credibility rating than
  newspaper coverage. Thus, specialty TV programs may offer an
  excellent opportunity for communicating your story. Such shows
  may include: local TV news shows, programs produced by community
  TV stations, business or information technology shows, and
  educational shows.</p><p>Because television emphasizes visuals, you should look for
  stories and angles that permit interesting or engaging video
  footage. (There is nothing duller than â$=talking
  heads.â$) TV news producers and editors like action,
  especially fast-paced action. They also favor stories with a
  local twist. Try and localize your story, which means making the
  news relevant and appealing geographically to the television
  station concerned.</p><p>Radio interviews are another excellent vehicle for
  publicizing your organization and activities. Contact your local
  radio station and pitch yourself as an interview candidate to the
  news director or assignment editor. Know that you must have a
  compelling and convincing answer to the question,
