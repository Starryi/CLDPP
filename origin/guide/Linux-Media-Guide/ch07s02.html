  don't do what too many other organizations do.
  During the show, they wait patiently at their booth until they
  spot a reporter coming down the aisle. Then, if the reporter
  stops at its booth, the exhibitor moves in with the same tired
  pitch used on everybody else who walks by.</p><p>If this has been your approach in the past, now is the time
  to change. Waiting until the show begins is already too late to
  capture the news media's attention. You should
  now understand that establishing strong news media relationships
  weeks or even months in advance can pay off when the show
  begins.</p><p>Begin by finding out which news media will be covering the
  show. The best way to get that information is from the
  show's public relations department. Ask them
  if they can give you the names of print, broadcast, and online
  media they are targeting. This information is important to know,
  so that you don't pitch the same story ideas
  as the show organizers.</p><p>If you discover the organizers are pitching an idea that
  fits well with your organization's objectives,
  ask if they could include your business as an example in their
  pitch.</p><p>Check the editorial calendars of both the publications that
  will be covering the show and other publications that might have
  an interest. (A computer magazine, for example, is a prime target
  for a large Linux conference.) Many publications will issue a
  special report before or after the show takes place. The report
  may be a section within an issue or even an entire special
  edition. If you cannot glean this information from the calendar,
  you should call the publication and ask.</p><p>The special reports present ripe opportunities for media
  coverage. Pitch story ideas that may become part of the special
  report to your media contacts.</p><p>Prepare a compelling news release describing the most
  interesting thing that your organization will be doing at the
  show. Mention awards, impressive results, or endorsements by
  Linux experts&#8212;anything that will snag the
  media's attention. Include the line
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">For more information or to arrange an
  interview, contact:</span>&#8221;</span> as part of your contact
  information at the end.</p><p>In devising your strategy to get media coverage at the
  show, always position your organization as
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">part of the solution,</span>&#8221;</span> not as a
  mere attendee.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch07s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch07.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1. Arranging Speaking Opportunities </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Planning for a Trade Show</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
