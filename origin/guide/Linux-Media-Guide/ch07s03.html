  months in advance. If you wish to have a significant presence at
  strategic or influential show, you should plan to set up a booth,
  either on your own or with a key partner. Booth space is limited
  and must be reserved in advance. Usually a fee is involved, which
  varies according to square footage and location on the exhibition
  floor. Designing the portable booth can take a few months, so
  plan ahead.</p><p>Here are some tips for getting maximum benefit from your
  trade show appearances.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pre_show"></a>3.1. Before the Show</h3></div></div></div><p>A major trade show requires considerable advance
  preparation and, if you aren't ready, can
  present a logistical nightmare. You must develop a solid plan and
  monitor your progress vigilantly.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Evaluate and select trade shows carefully.</em></span></p><p>Participating in a show can require a major investment of
  time, money, and resources. Be tough in your evaluation of a
  show's worthiness. Are the attendees likely
  customers for your organization? Exposure to a few hundred very
  qualified targets is better than exposure to thousands of
  generalists who are very unlikely to be interested in your
  business.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Read the show manual.</em></span></p><p>Before you do anything, contact the organizers of the show
  to find the show's manual. Everything you need
  to know about the show should be there, including a proposed or
  final schedule, registration information and forms, floor plans,
  exhibit specifications, invitations for potential speakers, and
  other important details.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Identify your goals.</em></span></p><p>Be specific about the things you want to accomplish as a
  result of your participation in the show. Do you want to increase
  visibility, gain exposure to a large number of customers who
  might be interested in your products, or check out the
  competition? Concrete goals are important to determine the value
  of the trade show to your organization.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Define measurements of success.</em></span></p><p>For each goal, determine a way to measure its success. Make
  these measurements as specific as possible. You could plan to
  hand out 1000 brochures, obtain contact information for at least
  200 prospects, and take a key editor out to lunch. These
  benchmarks will help you decide whether the show was worth the
  expense.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Put your show plan in writing.</em></span></p><p>The plan should include a workable schedule, a
  comprehensive list of preparation activities, and an individual
  assigned for each task. You cannot leave things to chance, or
  else Murphy's Law (Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.) will surely
  prevail!</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Develop a key message for your booth exhibit.</em></span></p><p>Like good advertising, a good exhibit clearly communicates
  one major message. This draws in more prospects to your booth
  than an unfocused cacophony of messages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Design an open, inviting booth.</em></span></p><p>An open booth design, with no tables obstructing access,
  invites attendees to come in. Your logo should be big enough to
  be seen from a good distance. Maximize <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">walking
  around</span>&#8221;</span> space by mounting brochure displays on walls.
  Use interesting graphics to draw people's
  attention. For demos, laptops and flat-screen monitors are
  space-efficient. If space permits, provide comfortable chairs to
  encourage prospects to linger. A portable booth should be
  reasonably easy to set up and take down.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Advertise your show participation.</em></span></p><p>Use tag lines such as: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">see us at Booth
  1525 at the Linux World Conference</span>&#8221;</span> in news releases
  and other communications leading up to the show (even if those
  releases are about something unrelated). Write a news release
  announcing show-related news. Invite editors to stop by the
  booth, or set up appointments between them and your
  spokespeople.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Order all necessary supplies, including brochures and
      giveaways.</em></span></p><p>If your marketing collateral needs to be updated or
  redesigned, take care of this early. You don't
  want to run the risk of having no brochures to hand out. Design forms for 
  filling out prospect information&#8212;clear forms eliminate
  guesswork. Consider giveaways to generate attention and a sense of
  fun. These don't have to be expensive. Pens
  with your web address and a catchy slogan can be very
  effective.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Design PowerPoint presentations and demos for the
      booth.</em></span></p><p>These will draw attendees to your booth and help them learn
  more about your business. Presentations will allow you to
  communicate information to many prospects at once.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Create a unique identity for your booth staff.</em></span></p><p>Decide on the dress code for your staff. Matching blazers,
  T-shirts, or even boutonnieres will make your representatives
  easily identifiable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Train your exhibit staff before each show.</em></span></p><p>This is very important! Your staff needs to know what is
  expected of them. They need to be briefed on all new programs and
  initiatives that should be emphasized. They must know how to run
  the demos and presentations, and they should know some basic
  trouble shooting. Nothing looks more unprofessional then demos
  that don't work.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="during_show"></a>3.2. During the Show</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Set up a rotating booth schedule for your staff.</em></span></p><p>Your staff needs breaks for lunch and relaxing. They will
  be more cheerful if they don't have stay at the booth all day long.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Remind staff to record all prospect information.</em></span></p><p>Encourage your staff to record everything they can learn
  about a prospect's needs and experience with
  Linux. Stress the importance of getting phone numbers and email
  addresses. (Creating an information form as suggested above will
  make this easier.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Encourage staff to greet people warmly and smile!</em></span></p><p>Amazingly, this is often forgotten. An inviting attitude
  can give a valuable first impression. The staff should avoid
  having their backs to the entrance, or taking phone calls while
  on duty. A friendly greeting to passersby may encourage them to
  stop rather than simply walk by. Staff who are uniformly
  courteous and helpful, knowledgeable about all aspects of the
  industry, and responsive to requests will make a very good
  impression.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="post_show"></a>3.3. After the Show</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Send requested literature immediately.</em></span></p><p>Send requested material within 24 hours. A quick response
  is your second opportunity to make a favorable impression. (Your
  performance in the booth is the first.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Include a teaser on the envelope or in the email
      subject line.</em></span></p><p>Be sure to mention your organization's
  name and the name of the conference on the outside of the
  envelope or in the email subject line, so they know your letter
  is not junk mail.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Help your prospects take the next step.</em></span></p><p>Make sure your literature packages make responding easy for
  prospects by including your web address and information on the
  opportunities available to them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Keep track of your prospects.</em></span></p><p>Nothing signals the success of your trade-show effort
  better than having prospects purchase your products or having the
  media spotlight your efforts. Keep a record of the customers who
  found out about your products through the trade show. Use these
  results to demonstrate the show's return on investment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Analyze <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">lessons learned.</span>&#8221;</span></em></span></p><p>After each show, evaluate what went well and what
  didn't. Critique each aspect of the show and
  ask others for comments. Pay special attention to feedback
  regarding communication to prospective customers. The
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">lessons learned</span>&#8221;</span> will help improve
  your efforts in future shows.</p></li></ol></div><p>Next, we will review the major topics we have covered in
