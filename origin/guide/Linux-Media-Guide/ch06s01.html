  not constrained by the tight deadlines of regular news articles.
  Features may be submitted at any time, depending on the
  editor's needs. Features often stem from a
  regular news item.</p><p>Imagine that the Linux operating system has been
  successfully implemented at a large organization in your
  community. This story is newsworthy, but begin to look for
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">the rest of the story.</span>&#8221;</span> What
  difficulties did they experience in the transition, or what part
  did your organization play in their implementation? This could be
  the start of a feature article.</p><p>More research and creativity will go into a feature story,
  but the must still be accurate. You will provide more facts, more
  statistics, more examples and anecdotes, and more analysis than
  in a news release. You can humanize and dramatize what may appear
  unexciting at first glance (a Linux implementation). You can
  openly focus on a particular angle or viewpoint, so long as you
  avoid outright advertising. Readers dislike advertorials
  masquerading as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">articles,</span>&#8221;</span> and no
  editor will accept an article that blatantly sells.</p><p>Another bonus is that editors are quite open to features,
  because they provide much needed content for filling an issue.
  When the feature is written by a reliable source and does not
  require payment (unlike a commissioned article), the article
  becomes a real asset.</p><p>All writing needs to engage the reader. The first sentence
  or two must be compelling enough for the editor to read on.
  Features require a strong lead&#8212;something to
  hook your target audience. A headline or a photograph may
  help.</p><p>For a feature, you have a wide repertoire of leads to
  choose from. Some leads are designed to startle and shock, some
  will excite readers' curiosity, some will
  vividly describe a real or imagined scenario, and some will
  succinctly state the nature of the story.</p><p>The body of the feature then unfolds in a logical sequence,
  and ends with a strong and memorable close. Every feature will be
  different, depending on the subject, the anticipated audience,
  and the skill of the writer. Reading features written by others
  in the Linux community is a good way to learn and pick up
  possible story ideas.</p><p>You can direct a feature to the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">feature
  editor</span>&#8221;</span> at a daily newspaper or your targeted trade
  magazines. Before going to the trouble of writing the article,
  you should pitch the idea to see if the publication has any
  interest at all. The pitch should include an outline, an
  estimated length (number of words), and a description of
  illustrations or photos you can supply. You could also include a
  selected portfolio of previously published articles about your
  organization.</p><p>The upfront consultation is invaluable. Since the editor
  knows their readership better than you do, they might suggest an
  angle of specific interest to their readers and indicate where
  this piece might fit in their publishing schedule. The more
  complete your package, the more seriously your work will be
  considered.</p><p>Another possibility is to plant the story idea with the
  editor, and let the publication take care of writing the feature.
  In this case, you can supply expertise and interview
  subjects.</p><p>Whatever your approach, keep in mind that the ultimate goal
  is to generate favorable coverage and visibility for your
  organization.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 6. Other Public Relations Tools </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 2. Bylined Articles</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
