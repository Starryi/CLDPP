  critical, in today's competitive marketplace.
  There are many ways a sustained public relations program can
  benefit your organization:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Public relations should not be a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">we
      will do it if we have the time and resources</span>&#8221;</span>
      kind of effort. A sustained initiative can build your
      organization's profile in the news media
      and the local community.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Editorial coverage gives your organization better
      stakeholder attention compared to paid advertisements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Editorial copy generated through effective public
      relations is far more believable and credible than paid
      advertising, due to media objectivity. Recent studies in
      North America suggest that positive editorial coverage
      generates up to nine times more visibility than paid
      advertising.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Public relations is an economical means of promoting
      your organization.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Regular and effective news releases can make your
      organization a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">news media
      source</span>&#8221;</span> on the state of Linux. It is critical to
      develop relationships with the news media in the same way it
      is a good idea to develop other kinds of friendships in the
      community. Writers and reporters are always looking for
      reliable and respected sources to quote.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Regular media exposure legitimizes your
      organization's work and enhances its
      reputation. There is a subtle but nonetheless real perception
      that mention in a newspaper or on television must be
      important. Media coverage communicates to the business
      community that your organization's qualifications and programs are
      worthy of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">a serious look.</span>&#8221;</span></p></li></ul></div><p>You must also be cautious when dealing with media outlets.
  Being overconfident or overly aggressive in trying to place
  stories with the news media can have damaging results. It is a
  lot easier to lose goodwill than to gain it back. The safest
  position is to understand what you are doing, work hard to
  accomplish predetermined and realistic goals, be courteous and
  respectful when dealing with your media contacts, and expect some
  disappointments along the way. After all, hard as you may try,
  the results of your public and news media relations initiatives
  are never predictable. But if planned and implemented correctly,
  the benefits are enormous. <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Public and Media Relations Planning">Chapter 2, <i>Public and Media Relations Planning</i></a> explains how
  to determine what you really want to accomplish.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4. What Public Relations Can Do </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Public and Media Relations Planning</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
