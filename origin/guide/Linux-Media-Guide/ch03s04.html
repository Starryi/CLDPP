  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">selling</span>&#8221;</span> your story) has changed
  over the years. Pitching is often not done just by regular mail,
  telephone, or even fax anymore. These days, most contacts are
  made through email.</p><p>Before sending anything, you should try to find out how a
  particular editor or journalist likes to receive pitches and in
  what format the pitch should be presented. In-depth database
  research on numerous publications and reporters is available from
  companies like LexisNexis and Dow Jones and can be a real asset
  to public relations professionals looking for contact
  preferences.</p><p>Every editor or journalist has their own preferences for
  receiving news releases and pitches. Knowing whether to call,
  fax, or email makes a world of difference&#8212;and
  may even be the difference between getting your news read and
  covered, and not. While sending the same email to 20 editors is
  quick, easy, and painless, your pitch may not get the attention
  your organization deserves.</p><p>Though e-mail has simplified and certainly quickened the
  transfer of information between public relations professionals
  and their media contacts, email has some drawbacks. Email is not
  as personal as a phone call, as quick as glancing over a fax, or
  as formal as a letter sent by post. The ease and ubiquity of
  email can sometimes make building a working relationship with
  certain editors or journalists more difficult.</p><p>For example, a particular Bloomberg reporter (who shall
  remain anonymous) does not like receiving pitches by email. In
  her words: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Email tells a one-sided story in
  its pitch. It makes it impossible to ask questions regarding some
  uncertain aspects.</span>&#8221;</span> Because of this, this reporter
  prefers to be contacted by phone. She will only read and accept
  email if the email relates to her beat and covers all the points
  she wants covered.</p><p>David Andelman of the New York Daily News prefers receiving
  pitches and news releases by fax, which he can read instantly
  without having to print them out. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I am
  [always] getting an abundance of press news,</span>&#8221;</span> he
  says. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">But at least with faxes, I can filter
  through them easier and quicker than I can with emails, deciding
  what is trash and what I can use. Don't waste
  my time. We are a daily paper.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>Samuel Brittan, an economic commentator with the Financial
  Times in London, likes old-fashioned snail mail.
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">There are problems which occur with email, be
  it privacy issues, bounce-backs, or just an
  over-abundance,</span>&#8221;</span> he says. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">I simply
  prefer to be mailed directly through the postal
  service.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>Carrie Donovan, an editorial assistant for The Washington
  Post, states: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Initially, I prefer postal mail
  pitches, since I receive artwork and photos for stories. Images
  sent via email tends to be problematic, either too small for us
  to run or it may look bit-mapped (jagged-looking).</span>&#8221;</span>
  She also observes that emailed releases are more likely to have
  missing information, something as seemingly obvious as an address
  to an event. Like most media professionals, Ms. Donovan wants all
  the facts delivered coherently and comprehensively. Failure of a
  public relations representative to do this is enough to turn her
  off completely.</p><p>Whatever method you use to correspond with an editor or
  reporter, always remember that media people are 
  <span class="emphasis"><em>extremely</em></span>
  busy. After all, they live and die by deadlines. Although you may
  want to know if your contact has received your pitch or news
  release, phoning them is generally not recommended. Most editors
  don't have the time to answer follow-up calls
  or engage in lengthy conversation. This again underscores the
  importance of giving them all the information in one
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">neat and clean</span>&#8221;</span> delivery. As Mr.
  Andelman bluntly states, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">We aren't idiots. If you faxed it to us and you
  didn't get an error message back, you know we
  received it just fine. And if we decide to use it, chances are we
  will contact you for more information.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>First impressions count. The best advice we can give when
  you are dealing with a news editor for the first time is to
  tailor the pitch specifically to that editor's
  beat. Then sit back and hope for the best. Although this approach
  sounds unpredictable, this is the nature of public
  relations.</p><p>By corresponding with editors in the way they prefer (which
  may not be the easiest or most convenient way for you), you will
  set a good impression for your organization. With persistence and
  good manners, you may eventually become an authority to whom
  journalists and editors willingly turn for commentary.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="getting_editor_attention"></a>4.1. Getting the Editor's Attention</h3></div></div></div><p>Editors pride themselves on keeping current with the latest
  developments in their field. Indeed, being current is a central
  aspect of their jobs and practically inescapable, considering the
  mountains of information delivered to their desktops. Since they
  take this responsibility very seriously, most editors
  read&#8212;or at least scan&#8212;every
  single release that comes in.</p><p>The big read usually begins as an accompaniment to the
  morning cup of coffee. Editors will read the
  release's headline, perhaps scan a paragraph
  or two, and decide whether the piece works for their
  publications. Since so much depends on passing this preliminary
  test, we will discuss in Chapter 4 how to give your release the
  best chance of being <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">picked up.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>Not every news release will contain earth-shattering news.
  In fact, many will be written mainly to keep the
  organization's name in front of the editors.
  Nonetheless there will be times when an item will be particularly
  newsworthy, timely, or significant to at least one editor. That
  is the time to pick up the phone and bring the item to their
  attention. Editors are sensitive to significant announcements and
  do not want to miss them any more than you want them missed, so
  calling is appropriate on these occasions. However, there are a
  few caveats.</p><p>First, remember <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> to call during the editor's
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">deadline time</span>&#8221;</span> of the day, week,
  or month. Note these periods in your contact database. Secondly,
  use the phone strategically. Do not phone too often or for
  trivial news&#8212;that is equivalent to
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">crying wolf.</span>&#8221;</span> If you will be
  making several important announcements within a short period, let
  the editor know you will be doing this instead of calling
  separately about each item. Only pick up the phone when all of
  your ducks are in a row; that is, when the information is ready
  to be released, and you are prepped and primed to answer
  questions. Finally, remember that any phone call should be brief
  and to the point, with additional information sent by email (or
  whatever format the editor has stipulated).</p><p>Using the telephone intelligently and to maximum effect
  will demonstrate your public relations savvy and professionalism.
  This, in turn, will increase your
  organization's credibility, increasing the
  likelihood that your news will be picked up.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3. Contacting the Editors </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 5. Pitching for Different Media</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
