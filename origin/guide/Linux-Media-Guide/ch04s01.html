  efforts depends mainly on how often your news releases are issued
  and, more importantly, how often the news they contain is
  selected to run. The latter decision is in the hands of a person
  whose title is usually <span class="emphasis"><em>editor</em></span>. Understanding an editor's 
  job will help you do your job better.</p><p>Can you name the editor of your local computer magazine or
  local newspaper? The editor is a very important ally in public
  relations. The editor (whose title might also be 
  <span class="emphasis"><em>managing editor</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>editor in chief</em></span>) 
  has overall responsibility for the publication's content. Below him or her,
  depending on the periodical's size, are
  subject editors who are assigned to specific beats (often called
  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">departments</span>&#8221;</span>). These editors
  oversee the content for their departments. Sometimes each editor
  has additional staff, such as reporters, freelancer writers,
  photographers, copy writers, copy editors, etc.</p><p>The information contained in news releases is the primary
  source of information for most editors. Newsworthy releases are
  selected and edited or worked into an article. The selected
  releases are the lucky ones; most never see the light of day.
  When you consider that the editor at a daily publication receives
  upwards of 500 news releases on any given day, gauging the
  statistical possibility of an individual release being picked up
  for coverage is easy.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="newspaper_editors"></a>1.1. Newspaper Editors</h3></div></div></div><p>Newspapers don't mean just the regular
  daily newspapers targeted at the general public. There are
  special-interest newspapers for business, computers, information
  technology, telecommunications, and other fields. The specialty
  papers may run weekly instead of daily, but, like their daily
  counterparts, they are primarily news-driven rather than
  feature-driven (which is more the case with magazines).</p><p>Newspaper editors reject many more releases than they use.
  The larger the paper's circulation or the more
  active the area being covered, the more releases the editor has
  to sort through.</p><p>Most newspapers have a space budget, which is not to be
  confused with a financial budget. The space budget consists of
  the total number of pages printed, divided between advertising
  and news articles. Advertisements are the lifeblood of a
  newspaper; ads consistently provide the largest portion of
  income. The ads must be accommodated first, after which the
  issue's remaining space is allocated to
  specific stories and departments by the key editors.</p><p>The selection of news releases to cover is based on the
  editor's personal and professional judgment.
  The main factor in that judgment can be summed up in a single
  word: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">newsworthiness</span>&#8221;</span>.
  Unfortunately, newsworthiness is defined by individual
  editor's opinions. Newsworthy stories are
  generally those that offer the most information with the most
  urgency to the most people.</p><p>If a news release issued on particular day is not covered
  in the following day's paper, this does not
  mean the news will not appear at all. Releases not considered
  newsworthy enough to appear in a weekday edition may be suitable
  for the weekend paper, where there is more room and less emphasis
  on breaking news. Even if a news item is selected for use, the
  article may still get pulled at the last minute. Perhaps an
  advertiser cancelled a large insert just prior to deadline,
  necessitating a layout change, or a big story emerged late in the
  day. When this happens, more expendable news is
  sacrificed.</p><p>What happens to releases that aren't
  selected for immediate coverage? Some are kept for future use,
  but more likely they are sent into the
  editor's trash can.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="magazine_editors"></a>1.2. Magazine Editors</h3></div></div></div><p>Magazines operate very much like newspapers, with
  departments, editors, space budgets, and advertising, but
  magazines differ in a few important ways.</p><p>The potential lifespan of a news release is much longer for
  a magazine. A monthly publication might not use your news for
  several months. Depending on the printing and preparation
  schedule, your release could appear as soon as a week or two
  after you send the release or as late as six-months later. The
  nice thing is that whenever your news appears, the information
  remains in front of the reader for a full month instead of just
  one day.</p><p>The editorial focus and format of a magazine are usually
  more specialized than those of newspapers. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Focus</span>&#8221;</span> refers to 
  the subjects a magazine covers; for instance, <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
  focuses on Linux in general while <span class="emphasis"><em>ComputerWorld</em></span>
  might focus on Linux in the enterprise. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Format</span>&#8221;</span> refers to the 
  way in which a magazine's news and information is
  presented, usually as a particular mix of regular columns,
  articles, features (main stories), shorter pieces, and editorials
  (opinion pieces). Magazine stories don't have
  to be as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">newsy</span>&#8221;</span> as newspaper
  stories. To a greater degree, a magazine researches and creates
  news rather than relying on current events.</p><p>General-interest magazines try to appeal to a large segment
  of the population. (Examples are <span class="emphasis"><em>Macleans, Readers'
  Digest,</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>People.</em></span>)
  Special-interest magazines target a limited, well-defined
  community of readers who share a particular interest along with
  associated activities and concerns. Special-interest magazines
  are good targets for the Linux community, especially those
  focusing on Linux, operating systems, storage, security,
  computers, and information technology.</p><p>Whether special interest or general interest, the closer
  your news release relates to the audience of a publication and
  the greater the impact on that audience, the more likely an
  editor will choose your news to publish. The key factors are
  editorial relevance and appeal to the publication's target audience.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 4. Working with the Media </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 2. Targeting Other Medias</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
