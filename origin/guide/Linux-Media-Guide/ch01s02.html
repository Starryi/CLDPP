  would benefit the Linux community. You have some idea of the
  people you want to reach with your news and views. Now the
  problem becomes: How to reach them in the most effective way? The
  better the communications between you and your audience, the
  higher the profile of your organization.</p><p>Generating publicity is not as complex as you might think.
  Most of the success of public relations centers on knowing what
  to do and when. Implementing these initiatives can dramatically
  increase awareness of your business.</p><p>Public relations (PR) is often confused with advertising,
  merchandising, promotion, or any of a dozen other buzz words in
  the marketing communications vocabulary. (By the way, 
  <span class="emphasis"><em>marketing communications</em></span> is a broad term that          encompasses all of these disciplines.)</p><p>Public relations is about doing something newsworthy that
  you want to communicate, and then telling your audience (or very
  likely, several audiences) what you have done.</p><p>One of the most common public relations vehicles is the
  brief <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">New Product</span>&#8221;</span> announcement
  you see in magazines and trade publications. Often only a few
  lines or a paragraph in length, these announcements herald the
  launch of future products or services. These short announcements
  are typically triggered by a new product release, which may be
  accompanied by various forms of communications such as internal
  announcements to the organization's employees
  and external news releases to the media, stockholders, user
  community, and other groups. News releases trigger a chain of
  events that result in visibility.</p><p>There are some important terms that may help you understand
  public relations.  <span class="bold"><strong>News media</strong></span>
  refers to all the places where people read or hear about news,
  including newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and the
  Internet.</p><p>A <span class="bold"><strong>news release</strong></span>, sometimes        referred to as a press release, is a printed or
  electronic document issued by organizations who want to
  communicate news to editors, journalists, industry writers, or
  other media groups. Journalists write about the story for
  publication (if it is considered newsworthy), while editors
  control whether the story actually appears in a newspaper,
  magazine, website, or broadcast.</p><p>A news release contains important facts, quotes from key
  people, dates that the news happened (or will happen), and
  contacts for additional information. The news release is concise
  and usually runs no longer than two pages.</p><p>Public relations, then, can be thought of as the process
  that delivers your news to the people you want to reach through a
  broad, influential, and far-reaching news media community.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1. Who Should Be Reading This Guide? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. How Public Relations Differs from Advertising</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
