  Think about the audience you want to reach and how to create
  excitement. An effective part of your strategy should be to
  enforce your organization's core messages in
  all news releases.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Have a good story.</em></span></p><p>A news story must have a compelling beginning, middle, and
  end. Journalists recognize a strong story within seconds, so tell
  your story quickly and succinctly.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Know your audience.</em></span></p><p>You wouldn't follow up on a potential
  business opportunity without knowing something about their
  business, so don't call the news media
  blindly. Before you pitch to any media outlet, study their work.
  Read the publication, watch the show, and listen to the radio
  broadcast. Get familiar with the characteristics of the media
  outlet you are targeting. Find out about their main audience and
  their likes and dislikes. (Internet message boards are good for
  this.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Invest in relationships.</em></span></p><p>The more you know about the media organization and your
  target editor, the better and more confidently you can pitch to
  them. Building relationships <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>
  means editors will be more likely to take your call when
  you've got an important story to tell. Best of
  all, even if they can't offer you coverage on
  this particular story, they may refer you to another reporter who
  can. As with any relationship, building trust is critical. Keep
  your promises, and be on time. Be upfront about what you can and
  can't do. You might not be able to do
  everything, but reporters will appreciate your honesty.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Think before you speak.</em></span></p><p>A word of caution: <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>
  you say to a reporter is on the record, regardless of
  disclaimers. You are representing your organization at all times.
  The impression that you give has a definite impact on how the
  media views your organization.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Monitor your media coverage.</em></span></p><p>Media coverage shows your success. As a media relations
  expert, the end goal is always positive media coverage for your
  organization. When your organization is spotlighted in major
  media outlets, you bring attention and respect to your
  business.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Look for a unique angle.</em></span></p><p>Look for personal stories that can spur news media
  interest. For instance, if a local school board is considering
  Linux to save money, focus your story on the human interest
  angle. Unusual stories and angles that affect a
  media's audience are more likely to get media
  coverage than mundane ones.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Know your story inside and out.</em></span></p><p>Research your story carefully. This allows you to revise your pitch 
  if the editor has specific needs. You also must be able to answer any questions
  that the editor may have.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be persistent.</em></span></p><p>There is a fine line between being persistent and annoying,
  but if you have a good story and know your audience, it is fine
  to make contact attempts until you get feedback from a
  reporter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Follow up.</em></span></p><p>Many potential leads are lost because public relations
  people fail to follow through. If a reporter tells you to call
  back another time, make sure you do! Also, if a reporter
  doesn't answer your email immediately, do not
  assume they are not interested. They might not have had time to
  respond to the large volume of emails they receive.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Be creative.</em></span></p><p>Infusing your media relations plans with innovative
  thinking produces stronger, more effective results, so avoid
  recycling the same old news releases and fact sheets.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Find information.</em></span></p><p>Do you sometimes feel like you just
  can't write the news release? This blockage
  often indicates you don't have enough
  information. Do outside research. Interview an industry analyst.
  Get another perspective. This investigation can lead to the
  information for a great story.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Study and adopt good writing skills.</em></span></p><p>Use a journalistic approach. Look carefully at how
  reputable publications like <span class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span>
  or <span class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></span>
  structure a story. What is the lead? What kind of quotes do they
  use? Study different types of stories. Features, appointment
  announcements, news articles, and opinion pieces can all be
  useful in your public relations campaign. Often, you will see the
  most important information is in the lead and that the rest of
  the story follows. This inverted pyramid style is usually the
  best way to organize an article.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Eliminate jargon and techno-speak.</em></span></p><p>Buzzwords are like bees&#8212;they can be
  highly irritating. Write with clear language, and avoid
  clichés, which are another sign of weak writing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Expect results.</em></span></p><p>Media coverage means increased visibility, which
      exposes your organization to more prospective customers. The
      more people you can reach, the better the impact will be on
      your organization.</p></li></ol></div><p>Finally, the success of your media relations efforts means
  success for <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
  in the dynamic, engaging, challenging, and creative business of
  public relations.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="apa.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 8. Quick Tips for Maximizing Coverage </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Appendix A. Monitoring Media Coverage</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
