>This documentation will attempt to summarize the installation and
configuration, as well as the day-to-day administrative and maintenance
procedures that should be followed to keep a Linux-based server or desktop
system up and running.  It is geared to an audience of both corporate as
well as home users.  It is not intended to be a full overview of Unix
operations, as there are several good texts available as well as on-line
documentation which can be referred to in cases where more detailed
information is required.</P
><P
>In general, your Linux system can operate with a minimum of user
maintenance.  Routine tasks, such as rotating and discarding of system
logs, are automated.  Therefore, for the most part, even with very little
user intervention, Linux will hum along doing its job.  However, in cases
of custom needs or system failure this documentation may prove
useful.</P

>2.2. Choosing a Linux Distribution</A
></H2
><P
>There is quite a variety of Linux distributions from which to choose
from.  Each distribution offers the same base Linux kernel and system
tools, but differ on installation method and bundled applications.  Each
distribution has its own advantages as well as disadvantages, so it is
wise to spend a bit of time researching which features are available in a
given distribution before deciding on one.</P

describe a given Linux distribution as well as provide information on how
you can download or purchase it:</P

>The Red Hat distribution, by commercial vendor Red Hat
Software, Inc. is one of the most popular distributions.  With a choice of
GUI- and text-based installation procedures, Red Hat 6.1 is possibly the
easiest Linux distribution to install.  It offers easy upgrade and
package management via the ``<TT

includes both the GNU Network Object Model Environment
(<EM

is aimed towards corporate users.  With the new OpenLinux 2.2 release,
Caldera has raised the bar with what appears to be the easiest to install
distribution of Linux available today.  In addition, it comes standard
with the ``K Desktop Environment'' (<EM

>The Slackware distribution, by Patrick Volkerding of
Walnut Creek Software, is the grandfather of modern distributions of
Linux.  Offers a fairly simple installation procedure, but poor upgrade
and package management.  Still based on the libc libraries but the next
version will probably migrate to the newer glibc.  Recommended for users
who are more technical and familiar with Linux.  This distribution is
available for the Intel platform only.</P

quite satisfied on several dealings with Internet-based software vendor
<A

On the other hand, you may wish to pay the higher price to the

>My distribution of choice is Red Hat Linux (it also happens to be,
unarguably, the most popular distribution among Linux users).  For almost
three years, I was a die-hard Slackware fanatic (before that I had messed
around a bit with a small distribution from tsx-11 way back in the kernel
0.90a days), and although I've tried Red Hat in the past, I never could
bring myself to say anything good about their distributions.  Then, I
tried Red Hat 5.1, and found myself quickly converted!  In my opinion,
with 5.1, Red Hat finally <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"got it right"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Some of the reasons I have become a fan of the Red Hat distribution
include the ease of installation, multi-platform support (until recently,
Red Hat was the only distribution vendor to provide its distribution for
Intel, Alpha, and Solaris platforms), and, above all, the RPM package
manager.  In addition, they put updates to included RPM's on their FTP
site (at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/updates/"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/updates/</A
>)
as they become available, which is a good way of keeping one's system up
to date and free of any bugs or security problems that are discovered from
time to time.</P
><P
>Since first loading Red Hat 5.1 on an otherwise unused computer at work
for testing purposes, I have converted two of our main Internet/File &#38;
Print servers over from Slackware to Red Hat and haven't regretted it.  
I've also loaded it on my system and home, and installed it on three other
systems as light servers as well.  In addition, I have had the opportunity
to not only play with the Intel-based versions but with Alpha- and
Sparc-based versions as well.  Recently, I've moved all the Linux systems
I am responsible for over to Red Hat 6.1.</P
><P
>Therefore, this document has a definite Red Hat <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"feel"</SPAN
>
to it, and is most relevant for the Intel-based 6.1 version.  However,
hopefully most or at least some of the information contained in this
document will be useful to users of other distributions.</P

></H2
><P
>Linux is a true 32-bit operating system that runs on a variety of
different platforms, including Intel, Sparc, Alpha, and Power-PC (on some
of these platforms, such as Alpha, Linux is actually 64-bit).  There are
other ports available as well, but I do not have any experience with
them.</P
><P
>Linux was first developed back in the early 1990s, by a young
Finnish then-university student named Linus Torvalds.  Linus had a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"state-of-the-art"</SPAN
> 386 box at home and decided to write an
alternative to the 286-based Minix system (a small unix-like
implementation primarily used in operating systems classes), to take
advantage of the extra instruction set available on the then-new chip, and
began to write a small bare-bones kernel.</P
><P
>Eventually he announced his little project in the USENET group
<A
HREF="news:comp.os.minix"
TARGET="_top"
>comp.os.minix</A
>, asking for
interested parties to take a look and perhaps contribute to the project.  
The results have been phenomenal!</P
><P
>The interesting thing about Linux is, it is completely free!  Linus
decided to adopt the GNU Copyleft license of the Free Software
Foundation, which means that the code is protected by a copyright --
but protected in that it must always be available to others.</P
><P
>Free means <EM
>free</EM
> -- you can get it for free, use
it for free, and you are even free to sell it for a profit (this isn't as
strange as it sounds; several organizations, including Red Hat, have
packaged up the standard Linux kernel, a collection of GNU utilities, and
put their own <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"flavour"</SPAN
> of included applications, and sell
them as distributions.  Some common and popular distributions are
Slackware, Red Hat, SuSe, and Debian)!  The great thing is, you have
access to source code which means you can customize the operating systems
to your <EM
>own</EM
> needs, not those of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"target
market"</SPAN
> of most commercial vendors.</P
><P
>Linux can and should be considered a full-blown implementation of unix. 
However, it can not be called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Unix"</SPAN
>; not because of
incompatibilities or lack of functionality, but because the word
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Unix"</SPAN
> is a registered trademark owned by AT&#38;T, and the
use of the word is only allowable by license agreement.</P
><P
>Linux is every bit as supported, as reliable, and as viable as any
other operating system solution (well, in my opinion, quite a bit
more so!).  However, due to its origin, the philosophy behind it, and the
lack of a multi-million dollar marketing campaign promoting it, there are
lot of myths about it.  People have a lot to learn about this wonderful
OS!</P

><P
>Why partition, anyway?  Well, although it is possible to get a
perfectly functioning Linux system running on a single-partition system,
and, in fact, is a bit easier to configure this way, there are a number of
benefits from partitioning one or more of your storage devices into
multiple partitions.</P
><P
>While it is true that Linux will operate just fine on a disk with
only one large partition defined, there are several advantages to
partitioning your disk for at least the four main file systems (root,
usr, home, and swap).  These include:</P
><P
>First, it may reduce the time required to perform file system checks
(both upon bootup and when doing a manual fsck), because these checks can
be done in parallel.  (By the way, <EM
>NEVER</EM
> run an fsck
on a mounted file system!!!  You will almost certainly regret what happens
to it.  The exception to this is if the file system is mounted read-only,
in which case it is safe to do so.)  Also, file system checks are a lot
easier to do on a system with multiple partitions.  For example, if I knew
my /home partition had problems, I could simply unmount it, perform a file
system check, and then remount the repaired file system (as opposed to
booting my system with a rescue diskette into single-user mode and doing
the repairs).</P
><P
>Second, with multiple partitions, you can, if you wish, mount one or
more of your partitions as read-only.  For example, if you decide that
everything in /usr will not be touched even by root, you can mount the
/usr partition as read-only.</P
><P
>Finally, the most important benefit that partitioning provides is
protection of your file systems.  If something should happen to a file
system (either through user error or system failure), on a partitioned
system you would probably only lose files on a single file system.  On a
non-partitioned system, you would probably lose them on all file
systems.</P
><P
>This little fact can be a big plus.  For example, if your root

>Finally, since Linux allows you to set up other operating system(s)
(such as Windows 95/98/NT, BeOS, or what-have-you), and then dual- (or
triple-, ...)  boot your system, you might wish to set up additional
partitions to take advantage of this.  Typically, you would want to set up
at least one separate partition for each operating system.  Linux includes
a decent boot loader (called LILO on Intel-based systems, although much
the same thing is available as MILO on Alpha, and SILO on Sparc) which
allows you to specify which operating system you want to boot at power on,
with a time-out default boot of your favorite operating system (probably
Linux, right?)</P
><P
>You should partition a disk (or disks) according to your needs.  In
my experience on Intel, Alpha, and Sparc platforms, for a fairly loaded
system (feature-wise), doing a fair amount of tasks (as a desktop system
at home, or as an Internet server at work), I have found the following
approximation of space works pretty effectively for determining a
partition size.</P

temporary files, the Linux kernel and boot image, important binary files
(things that are needed before Linux can mount the /usr partition), and
more importantly log files, spool areas for print jobs and outgoing
e-mail, and user's incoming e-mail.  It is also used for temporary space
when performing certain operations, such as building RPM packages from
source RPM files.  Therefore, if you have a lot of users with a lot of
e-mail, or think you will need plenty of temporary space, you might want
more space available.  The partition type should be left as the default of
83 (Linux native).  In addition, you'll probably toggle the bootable flag
on this partition to allow boot information to be stored
here.</P

thumb, your swap partition should be at least double the amount of
physical RAM installed in your system.</P
><P
>If you have more than one physical hard drive in your system, you
can create multiple swap partitions.  This can improve the performance of
swapping by taking advantage of parallel disk access.  For example, on a
256 Mb system with four drives, I would probably create four 128 Mb swap
partitions, for a total of 256 Mb RAM, 512 Mb swap (for a combined total
of 768 Mb available as virtual memory).  The partition type needs to be
changed to 82 (Linux swap).</P

consider splitting up your / (root) partition a bit further.  The /var
directory is used for a great deal of runtime storage, including mail
spools (both ingoing and outgoing), print jobs, process locks, etc.  
Having this directory mounted under / (root) may be a bit dangerous
because a large amount of incoming e-mail (for example), may suddenly fill
up the partition.  Since bad things can happen (eg. system crash?) when
the / (root) partition fills up, having /var on its own partition may
avoid such problems.  I've had success in taking whatever space I've
allocated to / (root), perhaps doubling it, and then creating separate

this partition can be as small as a couple Mb; I recommend approximately
10 Mb (which should give you plenty of room to store the kernel, initial
RAMdisk image, and perhaps a backup kernel or two).  The partition type

for it.  The partition type can be left as the default of 83 (Linux

will upgrade all the packages. If you've downloaded any kernel rpm files,
you should probably move them to another directory for now.  Upgrading or
customizing your kernel is a bit more complicated and needs to be done
with great care (see <A
HREF="#LINUX-KERNEL-UPGRADES"
>Section 10.4</A

on this).  Therefore before you apply the upgrades, you may wish to
consider moving all the kernel-*.rpm files out of your temporary upgrade
directory.</P
><P

``<TT

<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

upgrade them one at a time (ie. <SPAN

file_to_upgrade.rpm</TT

types who wish to ensure that each update is applied correctly without
error.  :-)</P

>Perhaps you are curious to see if a given package is installed
before you attempt to upgrade it.  Or perhaps you wish to find out what
version of a given package is installed.  All this can be done with the

>The X Window System, aka <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X"</SPAN
> (commonly and incorrectly
known by many as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X-Windows"</SPAN
>) is a GUI which sits on top of
Linux.  Unlike Microsoft Windows, the X Window System can look and operate
in a large variety of different ways.  It can operate very primitively or
very advanced, look beautiful or ugly, be sleek and fast or bloated and
slow (each of which are subjective qualities which cause as many arguments
among users as the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Linux vs. Microsoft NT"</SPAN
> debate seems
to).</P
><P
>Getting X working properly can range from simple to hair-pulling
complicated!  It is a common complaint among users who are new to Linux,
and I've fought with configuration settings countless times myself, so I'm
completely empathic about this.  Fortunately, such configuration is becoming
easier and more automated in the newer distributions of Linux.  In fact,
if you are using Red Hat 6.1 you will probably not have to worry about this
issue.</P
><P
>Although in a majority of cases X can be configured automatically,
there are exceptions; I would recommend you know or find out the type of
video card and amount of video RAM your system has installed, as well as
the type of monitor and its horizontal and vertical synch rates (this
information is usually available in the back pages of the monitor's users
guide, or can be found on the WWW).</P

>There are two main methods of getting X working under Red Hat's
distribution of Linux.  The first and easiest method, is to use Red Hat's
own ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Xconfigurator</TT
>'' utility.  The utility tries to
detect your hardware and installs the applicable X software with the
appropriate configuration settings.</P
><P
>If you are still unsuccessful after trying out various settings
with Xconfigurator, you may have better luck with the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xf86config</TT

user-friendly or attractive as Xconfigurator is, it gives you finer
control over the configuration process.</P
><P
>Finally, if you are <EM

have to resort to editing the
``<TT

hand and tweaking various settings.  If this is the case, you may need to
get help from the Linux community (see <A

details).  Relax, however -- in a majority of cases Xconfigurator does an
adequate job!</P

lack of rich colours.  This is because X uses a default 8-bit per pixel

><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN

Unix system.  This account gives you the ability to carry out all facets
of system administration, including adding accounts, changing user
passwords, examining log files, installing software, etc.</P
><P
>When using this account it is crucial to be as careful as possible.  
The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
> account has no security restrictions imposed upon
it.  This means it is easy to perform administrative duties without
hassle.  However, the system assumes you know what you are doing, and will
do exactly what you request -- no questions asked.  Therefore it is easy,
with a mistyped command, to wipe out crucial system files.</P
><P
>When you are signed in as, or acting as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN

shell prompt displays '#' as the last character (if you are using bash).  
This is to serve as a warning to you of the absolute power of this
account.</P

>The rule of thumb is, never sign in as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

absolutely necessary.  While <SPAN

and double-check them before pressing return.  Sign off from the
<SPAN

signed on for.  Finally, (as with any account but especially important
with this one), keep the password secure!</P

used by many tools (such as ``ls'') to display file ownerships, etc. by

risk.</P

In our example, we are allowing the host at 123.12.41.40 (probably a slave
DNS server in our domain) to request zone transfers.  If you omit this
option, anyone on the Internet will be able to request such transfers.  
As the information provided is often used by spammers and IP spoofers, I
strongly recommend you restrict zone transfers except to your slave DNS

><P
>Performing regular backups should be considered one of a responsible
system administrator's top priorities.  Although Linux is an extremely
reliable operating system, failures can, do, and probably will occur.  
They may be caused by hardware failure, power outages, or other unforeseen
problems.</P
><P
>More likely will be those problems caused by human error, resulting in
undesired changes to, or even deletions of, crucial files.  If you are
hosting users on your system, you will most certainly be requested to
restore an inadvertently deleted file or two.</P
><P
>If you perform regular backups, preferably on a daily basis (at least
for user files which are updated often), you will hopefully reduce the
possibility of, and increase your recovery from, such file lossage.</P
><P
>The safest method of doing backups is to record them on separate media,
such as tape, removable drive, writeable CD, etc., and then store your
backup sets in a location separate from your Linux system.  Sometimes this
may not be practical -- perhaps you do not have a fire-proof vault in
which you can store your backup tapes!  Or perhaps you do not have access
to such an external backup system in the first place.  Nonetheless, backups
can still be performed, albeit on a slightly limited basis.</P
><P
>At my place of employment, I perform backups on several Linux
servers. Depending on the situation, some of these backup sets are
written to tapes, others are written to a separate server over the
network, while still others are simply written to a separate disk
partition (for example, in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/archive/</TT
></TT
>'' file system) by an
automatic cron job (perhaps because the server is in a remote location,
for which a daily visit to perform a tape backup is impractical or
impossible).</P
><P
>At home, I do not have an external backup system, nor do I have
massive amounts of available disk space to write a backup image.  
Therefore, I instead back up only my user files on
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/</TT
></TT
>'' as well as some
customized configuration files in
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

><EM
>Portability</EM

(ie. the ability to backup on one Linux distribution or implementation of
Unix and restore to another; for example from Solaris to Red Hat Linux)
important to you? If so, you'll probably want to choose one of the
command-line tools (eg. ``dd'', ``dump'', ``cpio'', or ``tar''), because
you can be reasonably sure that such tools will be available on any *nix
system.</P

><P
><EM
>Unattended or automated backups</EM
> - Is
the ability to automate backups so that they can be performed at regular
intervals without human intervention important to you?  If so, you will
need to choose both a tool and a backup medium which will support such a
backup scheme.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>User-friendliness</EM
> - Is a
user-friendly interface important to you?  If so, you will likely want to
choose a tool which provides a text- or GUI-based interface.  The
commercial utilities may provide the easiest interfaces as well as added
technical support.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Remote backups</EM
> - Is the ability to
start backups and restores from a remote machine important to you?  If so,
you'll probably want to choose one of the command-line tools or text-based
utilities instead of the GUI-based utilities (unless you have a reasonably
fast network connection and the ability to run remote X
sessions).</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Network backups</EM
> - Is performing
backups and restores to and from networked hosts important to you?  If so,
you'll probably want to use one of several of the command-line utilities
(such as ``tar'') which support network access to backup devices, or a
specialized utility such as ``Amanda'' or one of several commercial
utilities.</P

>Caution: Extracting files from a tar archive can be a
dangerous thing to do, and should therefore be done with caution.  
Perhaps the files were not archived without a file path prepended (a few
misguided or uninformed developers distribute tarballs of their software
offerings like this), meaning they will all be extracted into the current
directory.  Perhaps the files were archived with leading
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/</TT
>'' slashes (by specify the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--absolute-paths</TT
>'' option when the archive was
created), meaning the files will be restored to their absolute locations
(even if you didn't want them to be).  Or, perhaps the files were archived
<EM
>without</EM
> leading ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/</TT
>'' slashes,
meaning the files will be restored under the current directory (even if
you didn't want them to be).  This of course, depends on how the backup
was created.  For this reason, I strongly recommend testing your ``tar''
command with a ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t</TT
>'' (<EM
>type</EM
>) option
<EM
>first,</EM
> and then replace the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

with an ``<TT

are absolutely sure the command will do what you expect it

This is the largest file-system, and is also fairly slow-growth.  The log
files for the web pages may also be stored here, and grow in size; check
and trim them periodically as needed.  On my machines, at the beginning of
each month the current web log files are moved to month summary logs (eg.
access_log.11 for November's log entries).  At the end of the year these
logs are all deleted and the cycle starts again (which means each January
1st should see a fair improvement in available space).</P

>The Red Hat distribution of Linux, including kernel, libraries, and
applications are provided as RPM files.  An RPM file, also known as a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"package"</SPAN

be easily installed, upgraded, queried, and deleted.  RPM files contain
information on the package's name, version, other file dependency
information (if applicable), platform (such as Intel or Alpha, etc.),
as well as default file install locations.</P
><P
>The RPM utility was first developed by Red Hat and provided as an Open
Source product as is common in the Linux community.  Other developers
picked it up and added extra functionality.  The RPM method of packaging
files has become popular and is used not only on Red Hat's but on some
other distributions as well.</P
><P
>Popular Linux applications are almost always released as RPM files,
usually in fairly short order.  However, in the Unix world the
defacto-standard for package distribution continues to be by way of
so-called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"tarballs"</SPAN
>.  Tarballs are simply files that are
readable with the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tar</TT
>'' utility.  Installing from
tar is usually significantly more tedious than using RPM.  So why would
people choose to do so?  Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a few weeks
for developers to get the latest version of a package converted to RPM
(many developers first release them as tarballs).</P
><P
>If you start installing or upgrading your system or applications with
tar, your RPM database will become out-of-date and inconsistent.  This
isn't really a big deal (when I used Slackware, I used tar exclusively
-- there was no other choice -- without too much discomfort), but wherever
possible I try to be patient and wait until an RPM becomes available,
or perhaps send a polite request to the developer of the package.  (You
can also build your own RPM files and distribute them to others, which
is sometimes helpful to developers who don't have the ability or time to
produce such files themselves.)</P
><P
>A really good place to check if a piece of software is available in RPM
form is the RPM repository at <A
HREF="http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/</A
>.  The repository provides indexed
categories which can be helpful to locate a given RPM file, and contains
pointers to thousands of such files.</P
><P
>To query a package, use ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -q pkg-name</TT
>'' (eg.
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -q pine</TT
>'').  RPM will either tell you what
version of the package is already installed, or that the package is not
installed.</P
><P
>Assuming the package is installed already, and is an earlier
version than the update package you downloaded (which it should be), then
you should be able to apply the update with ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -Uvh
pkg-name</TT
>''.  If all goes well, the package will be
automatically installed and immediately ready for use.  If not, RPM will
give you a pretty good reason (for example, perhaps a supporting package
needs to be upgraded first).  This may require a bit of thinking, but
problems such as these are very straightforward to figure out.</P
><P
>If, on the other hand, the package is <EM
>not</EM
> yet
installed, and you decide you wish to install it, type ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm
-ivh pkg-name</TT
>''.  If there are any supporting packages that are
required, RPM will tell you.</P
><P
>Sometimes, you will want to install a package that is only available
in source format.  In fact, unless you are installing packages from a
trusted source (such as the Red Hat FTP site), you probably
<EM
>should</EM
> install from source in case the binaries
contain a trojan horse or other nasty thing (of course, a source RPM could
also contain such a thing, but they are unlikely to because they would
probably be exposed in short order by another developer).</P

>Sometimes, you may find it necessary to install or upgrade an
application for which an RPM package is not available.  Of course, it is
certainly possible to do such a thing (in fact, it is the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"defacto-standard"</SPAN
> way of doing things in the so-called
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"real"</SPAN
> Unix world), but I would recommend against it unless
absolutely necessary (for reasons why, see <A
HREF="#USING-RPM"
>Section 10.1</A
>).</P
><P
>Should you need to install anything from tarballs, the general rule
of thumb for system-wide software installations is to place things in your
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/</TT
></TT
>'' filesystem.  
Therefore, source tarballs would be untarred in
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/src/</TT
></TT
>'', while
resultant binaries would probably be installed in
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/bin</TT
></TT
>'', with their
configuration files in
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/etc/</TT
></TT
>''.  Following
such a scheme will make the administration of your system a bit easier
(although, not as easy as on an RPM-only system).</P
><P
>Finally, end-users who wish to install software from tarballs for
their own private use will probably do so under their own home
directory.</P
><P
>After downloading the tarball from your trusted software archive
site, change to the appropriate top-level directory and untar the archive
by typing commands (as root, if necessary) as in the following
example:</P

><P
>The above command will extract all files from the example
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cardgame.tar.gz</TT
></TT
>'' compressed
archive.  The ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>z</TT
>'' option tells tar that the archive
is compressed with gzip (so omit this option if your tarball is not
compressed); the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>x</TT
>'' option tells tar to extract all
files from the archive.  The ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>v</TT
>'' option is for
verbose, listing all filenames to the display as they are extracted.  The
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>p</TT
>'' option maintains the original and permissions the
files had as the archive was created.  Finally, the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>f</TT
>'' option tells tar that the very next argument is
the file name.  Don't forget that options to tar are
cAsE-sEnSiTiVe.</P

additional drives with larger capacities online.  Yet ironically, the law
of probability dictates that as the number of storage devices increases,
so too does the likelihood of a device failure.  Therefore, a system with
a single hard drive is only 25% as likely to suffer a hardware failure as
a system with four drives.  [ Well, theoretically speaking, anyway :-) ]</P
><P
>Fortunately, such failures can be handled gracefully, and more
importantly without downtime, using a technique called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

one of several methods of distributing data over multiple disks.  This
redundancy allows for automatic recovery of data should a device
fail.</P
><P
>This section will describe the installation, configuration, and
setup of a RAID disk array using the Mylex AcceleRAID DAC960 controller.  
I have been very impressed with not only the performance and reliability
of the controller itself, but also with the technical support I've gotten
from Mylex -- they are very Linux-friendly!  (However, there are a wide
variety of hardware RAID solutions for Linux, and RAID can be implemented
in software by the Linux kernel itself.)  The type of RAID implementation
that is most useful is probably RAID level 5.</P
><P
>The first step in getting the RAID controller usable under Linux is to
build a custom kernel with driver support for the hardware.  The driver
for the Mylex DAC960 can be downloaded from the Dandelion Digital Linux
page at <A

>The final step in getting your RAID array usable under Linux is to
use the ``<TT

This is done in exactly the same manner as you would use on an IDE or
regular SCSI drive.  See <A

speed and reliability, Linux is up to the challenge of scaling up to meet
resource demands as they increase.  This can include moving to an SMP

greater processing needs, RAID levels 0 through 5 (either in software or

>On occasion, you may feel that your Linux server has outgrown the
hardware it is running on, perform a major Linux version upgrade, or
perhaps move to a different distribution of Linux.  There are, of course,
two ways of doing this.  Either you will be leaving your server on
existing or upgraded hardware (in which case you need simply shut down
services, back up your data, perform the required modifications, and then
restore data if needed), or in the more radical case, migrate your server
to new hardware.</P

you will be actually migrating your various services from the old server

>Chapter 12. Strategies for Keeping a Secure Server</H1
><P
>Linux can certainly be considered to be as secure -- or more secure
-- than operating systems from other vendors.  Admittedly, with Linux
becoming more and more popular, it is becoming a very attractive target
for crackers to concentrate their break-in efforts on.  There are exploits
that are discovered from time to time, however the open nature of Linux
usually means that such exploits are patched quickly, and security
announcements are disseminated widely, containing either temporary
workarounds or pointers to updated software.</P
><P
>I won't pretend to be an expert on security issues, however I am at
least aware of these issues, which I believe to be a large part of the
battle towards making one's systems as secure as possible.  Although being
aware and diligent in keeping up with security updates will in no way
guarantee that a system's security measures won't be circumvented, the
likelihood of a break-in is greatly reduced.</P
><P
>Although there have been security exploits found in external
services which could have been used by crackers to break into a system
(for example, the IMAP daemon exploit), I believe that it is far more
likely that a determined cracker will penetrate the system from
<EM
>within</EM
>.  Compared to the handful of services
communicating with the outside world, there are
<EM
>thousands</EM
> of commands and utilities available from
the shell, one or more of which may contain bugs which can be exploited to
penetrate security (that being said, I must admit to recently discovering
one of the servers I maintain had been compromised through an external
service).</P
><P
>For this reason, I recommend avoiding giving out shell accounts to
users unless they are absolutely necessary.  Even if you consider your
users completely trustworthy and have no qualms in providing them with
access to the shell, all it takes is just one of these users to have a
weak password.  An outside cracker, finding its way into your system by
exploiting this weak password, will then be able to work at his or her
leisure internally, looking for further weaknesses.</P
><P
>There are, fortunately, things you can do to greatly increase the
security of your Linux system.  While a detailed discussion of security

>Upgrade system tools, applications, and kernel:</EM

By far the most common cause of system break-ins is by not exercising
diligence in keeping an up-to-date server.  Performing regular upgrades of
the system kernel, tools and utilities will ensure that your system is not
filled with older items for which known exploits are available.  For
details on keeping an up-to-date server, see <A
HREF="#UPDATE-REDHAT"
>Section 4.9</A
>, as well as <A

>Smart password management:</EM
> Make sure passwords,
<EM
>especially</EM
> for users you are providing with shell
access, are strong and changed often.  Also, if you use multiple servers,
resist the temptation to use the same password for all of them (otherwise,
if a cracker breaks into one server using a discovered password, he or she
can break into them all).</P

>Use secure shell (ssh):</EM
> Switch to using ``ssh''
instead of ``telnet''.  Telnet is insecure for two reasons:  One, sessions
are unencrypted, which means everything, including username and passwords,
are transmitted as clear text.  Second, an open telnet port is one of the
first places a cracker will try to connect to.</P
><P
>Ssh provides encrypted and compressed connections and provide
substantially more security than telnet connections.  You can run a ssh
server (which allows incoming secure connections) as well as a client (for
outgoing secure connections) under Linux.  You can find binary RPM

a secure system.  In addition, report any break-in attempts to the
appropriate authorities -- it may be a hassle to do this, particularly if
your system sees several of these attacks in a given week, but such reports
ensures that would-be crackers are deterred by threat of punishment, as well
as ensuring that others' systems (which may themselves have been compromised)

>Although Linux is a stable operating system, should it happen to
crash unexpectantly (perhaps due to a kernel bug, or perhaps due to a
power outage), your file system(s) will not have been unmounted and
therefore will be automatically checked for errors when Linux is
restarted.</P
><P
>Most of the time, any file system problems are minor ones caused by
file buffers not being written to the disk, such as deleted inodes still
marked in use.  In the majority of cases, the file system check will be
able to detect and repair such anomolies automatically, and upon completion
the Linux boot process will continue normally.</P
><P
>Should a file system problem be more severe (such problems tend to
be caused by faulty hardware such as a bad hard drive or memory chip;
something to keep in mind should file system corruption happen
frequently), the file system check may not be able to repair the problem
automatically.  This is usually, but not always, the case when the root
file system itself is corrupted.  In this case, the Red Hat boot process
will display an error message and drop you into a shell, allowing you to
attempt file system repairs manually.</P
><P
>As the recovery shell unmounts all file systems, and then mounts the
root file system <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"read-only"</SPAN
>, you will be able to perform full
file system checks using the appropriate utilities.  Likely you will be
able to run e2fsck on the corrupted file system(s) which should hopefully
resolve all the problems found.</P

>After you have (hopefully) repaired any file system problems, simply
exit the shell to have Linux reboot the system and attempt a subsequent
restart.</P
