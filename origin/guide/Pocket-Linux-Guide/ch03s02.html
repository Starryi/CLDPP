    utilities can be squeezed onto a 1.44M floppy. There are three things that
    make this possible. One is the use of shared libraries. The second is
    stripped binaries. And the third is the use of a compressed filesystem. We
    can use all of these techniques to save space on our root disk.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm370"></a>2.1. Shared Libraries</h3></div></div></div><p>First, in order to use shared libraries we will need to rebuild
      the BASH shell. This time we will configure it without using the
      <code class="option">--enable-static-link</code> option. Once BASH is rebuilt we
      need to figure out which libraries it is linked with and be sure to
      include them on the root disk. The <span class="command"><strong>ldd</strong></span> command makes
      this job easy. By typing <span class="command"><strong>ldd bash</strong></span> on the command-line
      we can see a list of all the shared libraries that BASH uses. As long as
      all these libraries are copied to the root disk, the new BASH build
      should work fine.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm376"></a>2.2. Stripped Binaries</h3></div></div></div><p>Next, we should strip any binaries that get copied to the root
      disk. The manpage for <span class="command"><strong>strip</strong></span> does not give much
      description of what it does other than to say, "strip discards all
      symbols from the object files." It seems like removing pieces of a
      binary would render it useless, but this is not the case. The reason it
      works is because a large number of these discarded symbols are used for
      debugging. While debugging symbols are very helpful to programmers
      working to improve the code, they do not do much for the average
      end-user other than take up more disk space. And since space is at a
      premium, we should definitely remove as many symbols as possible from
      BASH and any other binaries before we copy over them to the
      ramdisk.</p><p>The process of stripping files to save space also works with
      shared library files. But when stripping libraries it is important to
      use the <code class="option">--strip-unneeded</code> option so as not to break
      them. Using <code class="option">--strip-unneeded</code> shrinks the file size, but
      leaves the symbols needed for relocation intact which is something that
      shared libraries need to function properly.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm383"></a>2.3. Compressed Root Filesystem</h3></div></div></div><p>Finally, we can tackle the problem of how to build a compressed
      root filesystem. The Bootdisk-HOWTO suggests three ways of constructing
      a compressed root filesystem using either a ramdisk, a spare hard drive
      partition or a loopback device. This project will concentrate on using
      the ramdisk approach. It seems logical that if the root filesystem is
      going to be run from a ramdisk, it may as well be built on a ramdisk.
      All we have to do is create a second extended filesystem on a ramdisk
      device, mount it and copy files to it. Once the filesystem is populated
      with all the files that the root disk needs, we simply unmount it,
      compress it and write it out to floppy.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>For this to work, we need to make sure the system used for
        building has ramdisk support. If ramdisk is not available it is also
        possible to use a loopback device. See the Bootdisk-HOWTO for more
        information on using loopback devices.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1. Analysis </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Construction</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
