>      As is the case in every other section of this book, the faster
      or better the technology, the more expensive it is.  But this
      should not stop you from cobbling together older technology to
      make it a bit better than it is at face value.
    </P
><P
>      The first example of this is Beowulf.  The original design goal
      of Beowulf was to take existing, low cost technology and create
      a supercomputer out of it.  To do this, machines were networked
      together using Ethernet running at 10 megabit.  Since this is
      too slow to have good communication between the nodes, the team
      did something different - bonded two 10 megabit cards together
      to create one 20 megabit connection.  This can be done in software, and
      doubled the performance of a system that would have cost too much
      to upgrade to 100 megabit connection per machine.
    </P
><P
>      These days, 100 megabit connections are standard for most machines,
      with the cost of these cards being under $75US per card.  Much like
      the cards of a few years ago had faster counterparts, so do today's
      cards.  Gigabit Ethernet over copper or fiber is available for those
      who want to spend a few hundred dollars.  If you want to get really
      outrageous and spend a few thousand dollars, you can get a proprietary,
      high speed (2GB), low latency network technology called Myrinet.
      Myrinet is really designed for clusters, mostly due to the high cost
      per server, and dropping down from this networking technology to
      standard Ethernet would lose many of the Myrinet advantages.
    </P
><P
>      Standard Ethernet works with a card, a hub, switch or router, and a
      cable to connect it all together.  The card acts as an interface
      between the system and the Ethernet bus, and there are a variety of 
      cards available, each with varying interface chips, memory, boot roms,
      and prices.  To explain the difference between hubs, switches, and
      routers, we have to take a look at Ethernet, TCP/IP, and layering.
    </P
><P
>      When a packet of data leaves a web server to talk to the web browser,
      it is a TCP/IP packet.  That TCP/IP packet is encapsulated within
      an Ethernet packet.  An Ethernet packet is destined only for the local
      network, and the TCP/IP packet will be re-encapsulated if it has
      to go on another network.  The TCP/IP packet contains the source
      and destination TCP/IP addresses for the packet, while the Ethernet
      packet contains the source and destination addresses for only the
      local network.
    </P
><P
>      A hub is an unintelligent device in that if one port of the hub
      gets a packet, all other ports on the hub will receive that 
      packet.  Due to this, most hubs are very inexpensive, but have
      poor performance, especially as the load increases.
      A switch, on the other hand, knows what Ethernet devices
      exist on each port and can quickly route Ethernet traffic between
      ports.  If a packet comes in on port one, and the switch knows the
      packet is destined to a machine on port twelve, the switch will
      send the packet only to port twelve.  None of the other ports
      will see the packet.  As a result, the cost for a switch is higher,
      but allows greater bandwidth for devices connected to the switch.
    </P
><P
>      Both hubs and switches work on the Ethernet layer, so they only
      look at the Ethernet wrapper for the packet and work only on
      packets that are in the local network.  When you want to connect two
      networks together, or connect to the Internet, you require a router.
      The router opens the Ethernet envelope, then takes a look at the
      source and destination of the TCP/IP packet and sends the packet to
      the appropriate interface.  The nice thing about routers is that
      the interfaces on it does not have to be Ethernet.  Many routers
      combine an Ethernet port and T1 CSU/DSU, or Ethernet and Fiber,
      and so on.  The router re-addresses the TCP/IP packet to go from
      one phyical media to another.  Routers usually have to have a good
      bit of brains in them to handle the packet re-writing, dynamic
      routing, and also requires things like SNMP management and
      some interface for the user to talk to it.  Thus, routers will be
      more expensive than hubs or switches.  Linux can act as a router
      as well, also tying in technologies like IP Masquerading
      and packet filtering.  In some cases, a dedicated Linux box can
      perform routing less expensively than a standalone router, since
      most of the <SPAN
