>2.4. How Much Machine is Required?</A

><P
>      A frequent question when deciding to buy new hardware is "How much
      hardware should be purchased for the task?".  A good rule of thumb is "as
      much as you can afford", but that may not be the whole answer.  You should
      consider the following when defining specifications.

>	  If you cannot afford a fully loaded system, can it be expanded after
	  purchase?  If you application would work best with 2GB of RAM, but you
	  can only afford 1GB, can the motherboard be expanded to add the extra
	  GB later on?  Purchasing a motherboard that can only accept 1GB means
	  you will need to buy a new motherboard (at least) later on, increasing
	  cost.

>	  How well does the design scale?  If you plan on buying racks of
	  machines, can you add new racks later and integrate them easily with
	  the existing system?  Things like switches that can accept new blades
	  to add functionality may save space and money in the long run, while
	  reducing issues like cabling.
	</P

><P
>	  How easy is it to install, upgrade, or repair?  While using desktop
	  systems in a rack is possible and will save money, replacing or
	  repairing the systems is harder to do.  A good question to ask
	  yourself is "What is my time worth?".
