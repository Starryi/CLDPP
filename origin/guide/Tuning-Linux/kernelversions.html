>      There are a few things to consider when deciding what kernel revision
      you should be using in a production environment.
    </P
><P
>      Officially, Linux has two major threads of development.  The stable
      releases have an even number as its minor number.  The Linux 2.2 and 2.4
      kernels are examples of stable releases.  These are considered by Linus to
      be stable enough for production use.  Few known bugs or issues exist with
      these kernels.
    </P
><P
>      The other release is the development releases.  These have experimental
      drivers or changes to them, and can cause crashes if used in production
      environments.  However, these releases will be more likely to support
      newer hardware.
    </P
><P
>      Most Linux distributions will often make a compromise between stability
      and performance by creating their own version of the kernel and source
      code.  These kernels start with a base of a stable kernel, then add in
      some newer drivers.  The resulting kernel is then tested to make sure it
      is stable, then released.
    </P
><P
>      As a generalization, stable kernels are good for production use, while
      development kernels may have better performance.  For your use, you should
      monitor the changes in the two sets of kernels and see if there are any
      performance increases that will make your system faster, then test that
      against a known stable kernel.  You can then make a determination of
      stability of the system versus performance.
