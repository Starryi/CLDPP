><P
>      Ethernet is the standard networking environment for Linux.  It
      was one of the first to be implemented in Linux, the other being
      AX.25 (Ham Radio networking).  Ethernet has been a standard
      for over twenty years, and the protocol is fairly easy to implement,
      interface cards are inexpensive, cabling is easy to do, and the
      other glue (hubs and switches) that holds the network together
      is also inexpensive.
    </P
><P
>      Linux can run a number of protocols natively over Ethernet,
      including SMB, TCP/IP, AppleTalk, and DECnet.  By far the most popular is
      TCP/IP, since that is the standard protocol for UNIX machines and
      the Internet.
    </P
><P
>      Tuning Ethernet to work with your particular hardware, as always,
      depends on the interface cards, cabling options, and switching gear
      you use.  Many of the tools that Linux uses are standard across most
      networking equipment.  Most cards available today for Linux are
      PCI-based, so configuration of cards through setting IRQ and base
      addresses is not required - the driver will probe and use the
      configuration set by the motherboard.  If you do need to force IRQ or io
      settings, you can do that when loading the module or booting the system
      by passing the arguments irq=x and io=y.
    </P
><P
>      Most of tuning Ethernet for Linux is to get the best physical connection
      between the interface card and the switching gear.  Best performance
      comes from a switch, and switches have a few extra tricks up their
      sleeve.  One of these is full and half duplexing.  In a half-duplex
      setup, the card talks to the switch, then the switch talks to the card,
      and so on.  Only one of the two ends can be talking at the same time.
      In full duplex mode, both card and switch can have data on the wire at
      the same time.  Since there's different lines for transmit and receive
      in Ethernet, there's less congestion on the wire.  This is a great
      solution for high bandwidth devices that have a lot of data coming
      in and out, such as a file server, since it can be sending files while
      receiving requests.
    </P
><P
>      Normally, the Ethernet card and switching gear negotiate a connection
      speed and duplex option using MII, the Media Independent Interface.
      Forcing a change can be used for debugging
      issues, or for getting higher performance.  The
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mii-tool</B
> utility can show or set the speed and
      duplexing options for your Ethernet links.

      through some configuration options.
