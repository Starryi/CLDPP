>      The next concept to understand is the total time through a system
      for one request.  Let's say you want a hamburger from McDonald's.
      You walk in the door and there are four people in line in front
      of you (just like normal).  The person taking and filling orders
      takes care of one person in 2 minutes.  So the person being waited
      on now will be done in 2 minutes, when the next person in line will
      be waited on, which takes 2 minutes.  In all it will be 8 minutes
      before you give the friendly counter person your order, and 10
      minutes total before you get your food.
    </P
><P
>      If we cut the time it takes for the counter person to wait on
      someone from 2 minutes to 1, everything moves faster.  Each person
      takes 1 minute, so you have your order in 5.  But since each person
      is in line a shorter period of time, the probability that there
      will be 4 people in line in front of you decreases as well.  So
      improving processing time of a resource that has a queue waiting
      for it provides a potentially exponential improvement in total time
      through the system.  This is why we address bottlenecked resources
      first.

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"potentially exponential"</SPAN
> improvement
      is that the
      actual improvement depends on a number of factors, which are
      discussed further.  Basically, the process time
      is most likely not constant, but depends on many factors, including
      availability of other system resources on which it could be 
      blocked waiting for a response.  In addition, the arrival rate of
      requests is probably not constant, but instead spread on some type
      of distribution.  So if you happen to arrive during a burst of
      customers, like at lunch hour, when the kitchen is backed up getting
      hamburgers out for the drive through, you could still see a 2 minute
      processing time and 4 people in line in front of you.  Actually
      determining the probabilities of these events is an exercise left to
      the reader, as is hitting yourself in the head with a brick.
      The idea here is just to introduce you to the concepts so you
      understand why your system performs as it does.
    </P

>      Another concept in high performance computing is parallel computing,
      used for applications like Beowulf.
      If your application is written correctly, this is like walking into
      McDonalds and seeing 4 people in line, but there are 4 lines 
      open.  So you can walk right up to a counter
      and get your burger in about two minutes.  The down side of this is
      that the manager of the store has to pay for more people working in
      the store, or you have to buy more machines.
      There are also potential bottlenecks, such as only one
      person in the back making fries, or the person in line in front of
      you is still trying to decide what they want.
