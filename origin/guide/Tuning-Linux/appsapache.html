>      Apache works best when it is delivering static content.  But if you're
      only delivering static content, you should consider using
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tux</SPAN
>, the Linux kernel HTTP server.
    </P
><P
>      There are a number of small quick-tips you can use to increase the
      throughput and responsiveness of Apache.
    </P
><P
>      One such tip is to turn off DNS resolving in Apache.  When Apache receives
      a request to send data to a remote server, Apache will request a reverse
      DNS lookup on that IP address.  While the requests winds its way through
      the DNS heirarchy, Apache is stuck waiting for the answer before it can
      send the page back to the requesting client.  By turning this feature off,
      Apache will merely log the IP address without name in its log file, and
      then deliver the page.  A problem with this is if the machine is cracked
      through the web server, you will have to do your own reverse DNS lookup to
      find out what country and domain the machine is from.  A way to have the
      best of both worlds is to run a caching-only name server run on the local
      network or on the web server box itself.  This allows Apache to quickly
      get the DNS information, and store a hostname and domain instead of just
      an IP address.
    </P
><P
>      Cutting the size of graphic images is also a way to improve performance.
      Using algorithms such as JPG or PNM will cut the size of the image file
      without reducing the quality of the image by much.  This allows more image
      files to go out per second.
    </P
><P
>      Instead of reinventing the wheel, see if Apache has a module for the
      feature you need.  Modules for authentication against SMB, NIS, and LDAP
      servers all exist for Apache, and you will not have to add the
      functionality to your server side scripts.
    </P
><P
>      Make sure your database is tuned properly.  This has been covered in
      <A
HREF="appsdatabase.html"
>Section 7.3</A
>, but a poorly tuned database can slow
      everything down.  If you expect heavy usage, do not put the database and
      web server on the same machine.  One machine running the database, and
      another running the web server connected by high speed (gigabit Ethernet)
      will allow both machines to operate quickly.
    </P
><P
>      Since so many web sites are using server-based applications and CGI, it
      makes sense to take a look at the server interpreters being used.  If you
      use a language like Java that is known to be pretty slow, you can expect
      lower performance as compared to using applications compiled in C.
    </P
><P
>      But Java has its own advantages over C.  The biggest is that Java is
      designed to be much more portable than C is.  Since Java is an object
      oriented language, its code reuse is much better, allowing delopers to
      create applications quicky.
    </P
><P
>      There are three other major server languages used by Apache.  These are
      Perl, Python, and PHP.  All three are included in most Linux
      distributions, and if they're not on your system, each is easy to install
      and get working.

><P
>        Perl is pretty much the granddaddy of CGI and server programs.  It has
	excellent string manipulation abilities, plenty of libraries to let you
	create web applications quickly, and has drivers for just about anything
	you want to do.  It is known as the programmer's swiss army knife, and
	for good reason.
      </P
><P
>        The downside to perl is that it is an interpreted language, meaning each
	time a perl application is run, the perl interpreter has to be loaded,
	the application has to be loaded into memory, and the interpreter has to
	compile the application.  This can create a heavy load on a system.
      </P
><P
>        
        The best way around this is to use the mod_perl library with
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>apache</SPAN
>.  This library first loads the perl
	interpreter so it is always in memory and ready to run.  It also caches
	frequently-used perl CGI scripts in memory already in a precompiled
	state.  When a perl application starts up, many of the bottlenecks
	(loading and interpreting) have already been done.
        The cost to the sysadmin and programmer is that mod_perl takes up a lot
	of memory, and its memory use will increase as more perl scripts are
	added to a web server.

><P
>        Python was one of the first of the interpreted languages to implement
	object oriented programming, allowing programmers to reuse and share
	code.  It also learned a bit from perl and it's interpreted nature by
	comiling python code into a pre-compiled format.  This format is not
	portable like Java, but does much of the grunt work of compiling a
	python application.  The python interpreter then spends less time
	compiling the application each time it's run.
      </P
><P
>        Programmers may cringe a bit when they start writing in python.  Syntax
	is much more strict than C or Perl, using tabs and newlines to delineate
	parts of code.  And, like perl, python requires the interpreter to load
	into memory and run.
      </P
><P
>        There is also a mod_python for apache that operates simiar to mod_perl.
	More memory and CPU speed will be a great improvement.

	<SPAN

	page, allowing authors to combine the web page and application into one
	file.
      </P
><P
>        PHP has two downsides to it from a programer's perspective.  First, PHP
	is still relatively new.  It is not quite as seasoned as Perl or Python,
	each of which have over ten years worth of development behind them.
	Second, PHP does not have modules that can be easily loaded and used
	like Perl and Python have.  If your implementation of PHP does not have
	the graphics libraries installes, you will have to recompile PHP and add
	them in.  Neither of these should prevent you from giving a serious look
	at using PHP for your server side application.
