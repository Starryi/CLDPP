        A sendmail system will probably be the most likely to be
	network bottlenecked, but that bottleneck will also
	most likely be outside the system itself.  There are no
	special tricks since a typical sendmail system will be
	fairly balanced against typical hardware.  Depending
	on the size of the mail store, some type of RAID
	system may be implemented, but the mail store data
	is very valuable so use a RAID 5 or other fault-tolerant
	option.  If the store does get very large, you might
	also investigate the benefits of multiple caching
	layers down to the card.
      </P
><P
>        Sendmail itself is very dependent on DNS lookups for its
	operation, and may be doing ident lookups as well.  As such,
	some tricks on the network can really help.  Linux 2.4 kernels
	offer a lot of QoS features, these can be used to prioritize
	DNS and ident lookups over bulk traffic, preventing blocking
	of POP, IMAP, and SMTP waiting on a DNS lookup.  I would
	also strongly suggest implementing a DNS cache locally,
	maybe even on the sendmail server itself.

></H2

	  Memory and processor requirements will depend on the number
	  of usersand whether you are providing POP or IMAP services,
	  or only SMTP.  POP and IMAP require logins, and each login
	  will spawn another POP or IMAP process.  If concurrent usage
	  of these services is high, watch for OS paging.
	</P
><P
>	  Using POP for delivery has a very low memory and hard drive
	  footprint.  In POP, e-mail is typically downloaded from the
	  server to the client.  The POP server merely handles authentication
	  and moving the data to the client.  When a mail message is sent
	  to the client, it is typically removed from the server.
	</P
><P
>	  Using IMAP puts much more stress on the system.  IMAP will copy
	  an entire mailbox into memory, and perform sorting and other
	  functions on the mailbox.  When a client requests a message, the
	  message is sent to the client, but is not removed from the server.
	  So all mail messages remain on the server until the client explicitly
	  deletes it.  The advantage to this is a user can have IMAP clients
	  on multiple machines and still be able to access all the messages.
	  Since most of the processing is offloaded to the server, this makes
	  IMAP a great mechanism for light clients or wireless devices
	  that do not have much memory or processing power.
	</P
><P
>	  Since the data on a POP or IMAP server are critical, you should
	  be using RAID-5 or RAID-1 to protect the data and keep
	  the server running.  POP has low memory requirements, while
	  IMAP has very high memory and disk requirements, and both
	  will likely increase as more users are introduced to the system
	  and they start working with mailboxes in the thousands of messages.
	</P
><P
>	  In either case, using SSL on top of POP or IMAP will also
	  increase the CPU load of the protocols, but will have minimal
	  affect on disk or memory usage.
	</P
><P
>	  It is not advisable
	  to put a shell account on the same machine as one running IMAP
	  or POP, due to the CPU and memory used by these protocols.
	  Nor is it advisable to use NFS to export a mailbox to a shell
	  machine, as NFS locks can cause corruption of a mailbox
	  if sendmail tries to deliver a message and the user is deleting
	  another message from the same mailbox.
