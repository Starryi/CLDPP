>      Since CPUs have a variety of functions crammed into a small space, it is
      hard to test how fast a particular CPU is.  A standard number for Linux is
      called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"BogoMIPS"</SPAN
>, which Linus needed for some timing
      routines in the kernel.  BogoMIPS calculate how fast a CPU can do nothing,
      and so will vary depending on the kind of chip used.  Because of how
      BogoMIPS are calculated, they should not be used for any form of
      performance measurement.

>      There are a variety of CPU functions that can be measured, including
      Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS), Floating Point Operations Per
      Second (FLOPS), and memory to CPU speed (in MBps).  Each of these will
      vary greatly depending on the choice of CPU.  MIPS are almost worthless,
      since some chips can have one instruction that runs multiple other
      instructions.  The MMX instruction set for Intel-based hardware is a good
      example for this, as MMX is set to perform matrix operations from just a
      few instructions, whereas without MMX, it would take many more operations
      to do the same calulations.  When measuring chip speed, does an MMX
      instruction count as one or multiple instructions?  Since the speed of
      running one MMX instruction is slightly faster than running the multiple
      instructions that make it up, it will make an MMX-based chip appear
      slower.

>      Many online reviewers use games as a measurement of the CPU.  The idea is
      that 3D games provide a good stress test of the CPU, memory interface,
      system bus, and video card.  The result is the number of Frames Per Second
      (FPS).  More FPS means a faster overall system.  Since most servers do not
      have a 3D card in them, this may not be a good choice of measurement.
      Workstations may get a benefit from this kind of testing, however.
    </P
><P
>      One other measurement form is that of other third-party applications.
      Applications like SETI@Home, distributed.net can give generic speed
      ratings that are good to compare against other machines running the same
      software.  Other CPU-intensive applications like MP3 encoders can also be
      a good guide of how fast a CPU is.  The down side to these are that the
      results have to be compared to the results of other machines running the
      exact same software.  If the software is not available for that
      OS/Hardware combination, the test is worthless.
    </P
><P
>      So what does this leave us with?  Unfortunately, not a lot.  The best bet
      appears to be MIPS and FLOPS, since it does test instructions per second,
      and as
      long as the chipset remains the same (Intel based, SPARC, Alpha, etc.),
      the
      measurements can be compared pretty easily and the comparisons will be
      close enough.
