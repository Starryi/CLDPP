>      Mosix, Beowulf, and other clustering technologies for Linux
      all depend on an effective network layer.  Any delays in getting
      data from the application to the physical layer would cause
      even greater delays in the time to complete the task.  Much work
      has been done to the Linux network stack to reduce this time,
      known as latency, and increase the amount of data that can
      be sent over a period of time, known as bandwidth.
    </P
><P
>      Latency is important as under high loads, the delay of getting
      data through the network layer will slow down the number of requests
      that can be handled at once.  Bandwidth is important since you want
      services like NFS to be able to saturate its network link with data.
      This means that should all the services of a file server be needed,
      it can be provided to as many clients as request it.
    </P
><P
>      This chapter will start with an explination of the available networking
      technologies, then get into how some of these technologies can be
      tuned for both latency and bandwidth improvements.  We will then
      take a look at some of the standard TCP/IP applications and some
      tuning hints or gotchas.
