>      Setting the Maximum Transmission Unit (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MTU</ACRONYM
>) of a
      network interface can be used to tune performance over a TCP/IP link.  The
      MTU is used to set the maximum size of a packet that goes out on
      the wire.  If data is set to go out that is larger than the MTU, the
      packet is broken up into smaller packets.  This can take up some
      processing time to create the Ethernet packets, and decreases bandwidth.
      Ethernet has a set number of bytes it adds on to a packet, no matter
      the size.  Larger packets will have a smaller percentage of overhead
      used up by the Ethernet header.  On the other hand, smaller packets
      is better for latency, since TCP/IP will wait for the MTU to be filled,
      or a timeout to occur before sending a packet of data.  In the event
      of an interactive TCP/IP connection (such as telnet or ssh), the
      user does not want to wait long for their packet to make it from
      their machine to the remote machine.  Smaller MTUs make sure
      the packet size is met earlier and the packet goes out quickly.
    </P
><P
>      In addition, MTUs also have to fit into the size of the medium the
      packet is running over.  Ethernet has a maximum packet size of
      ??WHATISIT??, counting the Ethernet header packets.  Asynchronous
      Transfer Mode, or <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ATM</ACRONYM
>, has a very small MTU,
      on the order of a few bytes.  By default, Ethernet TCP/IP connections
      have a MTU of 1500 bytes.  The MTU can be set using
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifconfig</B

>      It is recommended to leave the MTU at the maximum number, since almost
      all non-interactive TCP/IP applications will transfer more than 1500
      bytes per session, and a bit of latency for interactive applications
      is more an annoyance than an actual performance bottleneck.

>      When using Domain Name Servers (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DNS</ACRONYM
>), you may
      run into cases where DNS resolution is a performance bottleneck.  We
      will get into this more in <A
HREF="appsapache.html"
>Section 7.5</A
>, but
      some applications recommend for best performance to log the
      raw TCP/IP addresses that come in and do not try to resolve it to
      a name.  For security reasons, you may want to change this so you can
      quickly find out what machine is trying to break into your web server.
      This decision is left to you, the administrator, as part of the
      never-ending balance between performance and security.  A potential fix
      for this is to run a caching name server locally to store often-used
      TCP/IP addresses and name, and leave the real DNS serving to another
      machine.
    </P
><P
>      Applications like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ping</B
> will sometimes appear to fail
      if DNS is not configured properly, even if you try to ping a TCP/IP
      address instead of using the name.  The solution to this and
      other TCP/IP management applications, is to find the option that
      prevents resolution of names or TCP/IP addresses.  For
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ping</B
>, this is to give the -n option.
