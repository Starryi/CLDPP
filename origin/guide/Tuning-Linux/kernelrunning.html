>      When Linux first got started, changing options to the kernel often
      required recompiling.  Getting information out of Linux required
      applications be recompiled to look at the right memory location
      to get things like user and process lists.  After the release
      of the 1.0 kernel, the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
>
      filesystem arrived as a way to access information in a kernel-independent
      way.  Because of this, a command like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ps</B
> will
      keep operating even if the kernel rev changes.  The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> filesystem also allows you
      to change the kernel itself wile running, allowing you to add
      in features like TCP/IP forwarding, manage RAID cards, and so on.

	      makes it much more helpful than <B
