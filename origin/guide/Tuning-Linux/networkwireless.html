><P
>      Wireless Ethernet, also known as IEEE 802.11b, is becoming more 
      popular as the cost to implement decreases and availability of
      more products increase.  The Apple AirPort and Lucent Orinoco cards
      have brought wireless into the home market, allowing a person to
      have Ethernet access anywhere in their house, and schools
      are deploying Wireless Ethernet across the campus.  It's now available
      at airports, schools, many high tech companies, and soon upscale
      coffee shops.
    </P
><P
>      Given that 802.11b is most popular for laptops, since they are portable,
      tuning for performance is not as great importance as tuning for power
      usage.  Using 802.11b is often very power-consuming and can quickly
      drain the batteries.  Some cards (such as the Lucent Orinoco card)
      have the ability to turn its antenna on and off at regular
      intervals.  Instead of the antenna being on all the time, it turns
      on a few times a second.  With the transmitter being turned off
      now more than half the time, the battery usage is decreased.  There is
      an increase of latency and decrease in data rate.
    </P
><P
>      To set the power management of the card, you will need to have the
      wireless tools, available with many distributions.  This package contains
      three commands for managing your wireless card: iwconfig, iwspy, and
      iwpriv.
    </P
><P
>      The <B

      <B

>ifconfig</B
>.  Run without any options, it will check all
      available interfaces and checks for wireless extensions.  If there are
      any, it will report similar to the following:

      My current bit rate is 2Mb/s, probably because my link quality is so low.
      The link quality is 8 out of 92, indicating that I should either move my
      laptop, move my base statiopn, or throw out my 2.4Ghz phone.
