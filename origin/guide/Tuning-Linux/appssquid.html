>      Squid proxy server has two common uses.  The first is as a proxy 
      cache for internal clients access the external web.  The second is
      as a reverse proxy, caching content from internal web servers.

>7.1.1. Squid as a proxy cache</A
></H2
><P
>        Squid as a proxy cache stores large numbers of web pages, enabling
	them to be sent to clients upon request instead of requiring
	another internet fetch.  Squid uses large amounts of disk space
	for the cache, but by nature doesn't access any one that much more
	frequently than any other.
      </P
><P
>        The first thing to avoid is a disk bottleneck.  In a high-usage
	environment, you will definitely want to distribute the cache file
	across as many spindles as is practical.  Since the cache data is
	relatively worthless, in that it is flushed out as a matter of
	course, the additional overhead of a RAID 5 or other relatively
	fail-safe multi-spindle system is not necessary.  RAID 0 striping
	will provide the fastest access with no fail-safe requirements.
      </P
><P
>        The next thing to avoid is a memory bottleneck.  There should
	ABSOLUTELY be no OS paging with Squid, Squid will page enough on
	its own.  This is a case where Squid has in effect its own virtual
	memory system, with thousands of pages on disk and tens or
	hundreds in memory.  If the OS is paging to provide the tens or
	hundreds in memory, your performance will be horrible.
      </P
><P
>        Network performance will probably not be a big deal.  If your
	byte hit rate is 25%, and you are maxing out a T1, you are still
	only putting around 2Mbps out your Ethernet connection.

>7.1.2. Squid as a reverse proxy</A
></H2
><P
>        As a reverse proxy, the total set of web pages that Squid is
	proxying is reduced greatly.  It must store only the limited
	number of pages behind it on your web servers, as opposed to
	the entire internet.  Since disk storage requirements are down
	by an order of magnitude, so are memory requirements.
      </P
><P
>	However, one approach to this situation would be to build up
	real memory until the entire working set of pages could be
	stored, with no paging required.
      </P
><P
>        In this case we're trading large store/infrequent access for a
	smaller store/frequent access.  We want to optimize the byte
	hit rate in Squid with real memory to reduce disk operations.
	Again, there should be NO OS PAGING.  If any DNS lookups are
	required, it might be a good idea to run a DNS cache locally.
	Otherwise, this shouldn't be too difficult to tune to get
	good performance.
