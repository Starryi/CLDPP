      There are, as you may know, two major hard disk technologies
      that work under Linux: Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), and Small
      Computer System Interface (SCSI).  At the lowest level, IDE and
      SCSI drives share enough technology that IDE and SCSI drives
      are exactly the same save for a PCB board and physical interface
      on the disk itself.  That PCB and phyiscal interface can command
      a premium in price on drive.

></H2
><P
>        The history of SCSI drives starts not with large servers
        running multibillion dollar companies, but as its name
        implies, with small systems.  SCSI had one of its first
        implementation on the Apple Macintosh Plus systems.
        SCSI was made to be a general purpose interface, supporting
        not only hard drives, but scanners, CD-ROMs, serial ports,
        and other devices off of one common bus.  Cables were
        inexpensive, the protocol was relatively open, and was
        fast for its time, reaching a maximum of 4MB per second.
      </P
><P
>        SCSI was picked up by server vendors, such as
        Sun and IBM, since it created a common way for servers
        to share devices.  Its advantages in design made it very
        well suited to have multiple devices on the same bus
        with little contention between devices.  Unlike IDE, when
        a SCSI controller makes a request, the drive drops its
        hold on the line, fetches the information, and then
        picks up the line and sends the response.  This allows the
        CPU to continue working on other tasks, so it is not I/O
        bound waiting for the drive.  Other devices on the SCSI bus
        can communicate during this time.  Another advantage to SCSI
        is that you can have multiple SCSI controllers on the
        same bus.  This allows two or more machines to access a single
	SCSI bus and drives that are on that bus.
      </P
><P
>        The increased performance of SCSI and low quantity of
        SCSI drives being made as compared to IDE drives has caused
        an increase in price of SCSI drives.  In many cases, this
        can be almost double the price. But if you need the performance,
        the cost is worth it.

>        SCSI drives are actually stupid.  They rely on a controller
        chip to tell them what to do.  In many cases, a SCSI drive
        used by one SCSI controller cannot be moved to another
        controller and expect to keep all the data safe, since
        each controller has its own way of formatting data on
        the drive.  IDE drives contain most of the brains on the
        drive itself.  This makes it easier for system vendors
        to add support into their systems, reducing cost.  These
        days, most systems will integrate serial ports, IDE, and
        USB all in one chip.  SCSI still requires a (large) dedicated
        chip on the system to work.
      </P
><P
>        The lower cost of parts and higher volume of IDE has made it
        very low cost for most single user systems while retaining
        some of the higher performance of SCSI.  But many of the
        features of SCSI are not available in IDE:  external boxes,
	hot swapping,
        and devices like scanners.  In addition, when an IDE drive
        is asked to do something, that IDE bus is locked while
        the drive processes the request.  IDE devices are usually limited
        to two devices per bus, but can have multiple busses per system.
	Most motherboards come with two IDE busses standard.
      </P
><P
>        Burst performance of IDE drives gets close to that of SCSI,
        but will really only be seen on single user systems such
        as personal workstations.
      </P
><P
>        In the past few years, IDE has had trouble with the existing
        x86 BIOS and larger capacity IDE drives.  Since the BIOS
        has only a limited amount of space to store drive information,
        no way for supporting very large drives was almost impossible
        without modifying the BIOS itself, which would cause headaches
        for do-it-yourself system builders.  Until 2000, Linux would
        not boot on partitions that were larger than 1GB.  Fortunately,
        more recent BIOSes are smart enough to work around these
        size limitations, and Linux has found a way around its
        booting issues.
      </P
><P
>        The future of IDE includes more of the existing ATA/66 and ATA/100
	standards, which provide 66 Mbit and 100 Mbit burst speeds,
	repspectively.  Also upcoming is Serial ATA, which uses a lower
	number of connectors and boosts speed rates to over 1Gbps.

><P
>        Based on the way that IDE and SCSI differ, you should take
        performance into mind when choosing a hard drive bus
        for your systems.  A machine that is part of a cluster
        that relies on network storage can use the less expensive
        IDE drives, since the drive will not be a bottleneck.  A
        machine that will be used as the network storage device
        should have the faster SCSI interface.
      </P
><P
>        There are plenty of grey areas between these two extremes.
        But you should ask yourself a few questions while deciding:
