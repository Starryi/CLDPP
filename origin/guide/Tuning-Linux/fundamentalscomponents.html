><P
>     The first, and most important, concept is looking at a server as a
     system of components.  While you may get tremendous performance
     gains by moving from 7200 RPM to 10,000 RPM drives, you may not.  To
     determine what needs to be done, and what benefit improving a
     particular component will be, you must first lay out the system
     and evaluate each component.

>Processor</DT
><DD
><P
>            The processor, or processors, in a system are quite obviously
            the little black chip, or card edge socket, or big card/chip
            and heatsink combination on the motherboard.  But the
            processor subsytem referred to here includes not only the
            processor, but also the L1 and L2 processor caches, the
            system bus, and various motherboard components.

>Physical Disk</DT
><DD
><P
>            The physical disk subsytem includes the disk drive spindles
            themselves, as well as the interface between drive and
            controller/adapter card, the adapter card or cards, and
            the bus interface between controller/adapter card and the
            motherboard.

>Network</DT
><DD
><P
>	    The definition of the network subsystem varies depending on
            who you ask.  All definitions include the network card and
	    its bus interface, and the physical media it connects to,
	    such as Ethernet.  If you are looking at improving the
	    performance of a server this is all that concerns
            you.  However, in a larger analysis of performance this
	    subsystem may include and number of network links between your
	    server and clients.
	  </P

><DT
>Memory</DT
><DD
><P
>	    The memory subsystem includes two major types of memory, real
            and virtual.  Real memory is the chip, chips, or cards in the
	    computer that provide physical memory.  Virtual memory includes
	    this memory as well as the virtual memory stored on disk,
            often referred to as a paging file or swap partition.

>Operating System</DT
><DD
><P
>	    The single most complex component of any system is the
	    operating system.  While there are more opportunities for
	    tuning here, there are also more opportunities to make a
	    simple mistake that will cost you thousands in additional
	    hardware to handle the load.
