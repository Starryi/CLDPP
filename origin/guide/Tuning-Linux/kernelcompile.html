>      There is a specific order to getting your kernel compiled, and there
      is nothing preventing you from having multiple kernels and modules
      on the same system.  This allows you to boot test kernels while keeping
      a known stable kernel in case you have trouble.  Boot loaders like LILO
      will allow you to select a kernel at bootup.

      the official site for Linux kernels.  These kernels are almost always
      in tar-bzip2 format, instead of being in RPM or DEB formats.  Check with
      your distribution provider for packaged formats of the kernel.

	can be implemented either in software or hardware.  Software watchdogs
	open and close files to make sure that everything is working.  If the
	driver cannot open the file, it tries to trigger a reboot of the system,
	since this indicates that there is some error with the system.
	Watchdog timers are usually implemented ISA cards, but some
	single board computers will have the necessary chips built in.  Hardware
	watchdogs are a bit better as it can monitor extra features such
	as temperature and fan speed and can trigger reboots on those events as
	well.  Hardware watchdogs are a bit more proactive as they continually
	talk to the kernel driver.  If the kernel driver does not respond,
	the watchdog triggers a reset.

>        While this book is not specifically covering security, it is
	fair to bring it up every now and then.  For those who want
	hard core, as-uncrackable-as-possible systems, you may want
	to consider removing module support from your system.
      </P
><P
>        The reason for this is that if a cracker were to gain access
	to your system, one of the more advanced methods of covering their
	tracks is to insert a kernel module that hides much of their activity.
      </P
><P
>        Another tactic is to replace an existing module with a trojan horse.
	Once the module is loaded, its payload deploys in kernel space instead
	of userspace, giving the rogue code more access to the system.
      </P
><P
>        Another reason to remove modules from your system is to create a smaller
	size kernel.  With modules compiled into the kernel, they get
	compressed along with the rest of the kernel using bzip2.  Normally
	module files are uncompressed, but bzip2 can compress sizes by
	more than half.  This can save crucial space if it is required.
      </P
><P
>        For most users, however, you will want to use modules, as it gives a
	very versitile way of installing new drivers by just loading
	the module.

      </P
><P
>        Most users will want to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>bzip2</SPAN

	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

CLASS="COMMAND"
>make

	You may want to just use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make bzlilo</B
> to put the
	kernel into <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT

	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lilo</B
> to let you boot the new kernel.
        Some users may not want their kernel in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>, since many distributions create a small
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> partition that contains
	the kernel and enough to boot the kernel.  In this event, you will
	want to copy the kernel by and into <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT

      </P
><P
>        If you will be using modules, you will also need to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make
	modules</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make modules_install</B
>.  These
	two commands will build and install the modules for your kernel.
