><P
>      The last concept to cover here is the interrelation between
      subsystems on the total systems performance.  If a system is
      short on memory, it will page excessively.  This will put
      additional load on the drive subsystem.  While tuning the drive
      subsystem will definitely help, the better answer is to add more
      memory.
    </P
><P
>      As another example, your system may be performing just fine except
      for the network connection, which is 10Base-T.  When you upgrade
      the network card to 100Base-T, performance improves only marginally.
      Why?  It could very well be that the network was the bottleneck, but
      removing that bottleneck immediately revealed a bottleneck on the disk
      system.
    </P
><P
>      This makes it very important that you accurately measure where
      the bottleneck is.  It can not only improve the time it takes
      you to speed up the system, but also save money, since you
      only need to upgrade one subsystem instead of many. 
    </P
><P
>      The best way to find out the interrelations depends on the application
      you are using.  As we go through various subsystems and applications
      in this book, you will have to keep this in mind.  For example, the
      Squid web cache has heavy memory and disk requirements.  Using less
      memory will increase the disk usage, and decrease performance.  By
      looking at memory usage, you can see that memory is being swapped to
      the hard drive.  Increasing the available memory so that no more swapping
      of squid will be your best performance bet.
