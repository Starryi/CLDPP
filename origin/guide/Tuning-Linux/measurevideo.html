>      If you want to tune a workstation, or create a killer Quake III box, you
      will want to pay attention to the video subsystem and see how well it
      performs.  For 2D applications, you can test the system using
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>x11perf</B
>.  This program will perform a variety of tests
      using the X server and drivers.  Since it is designed for performance
      testing, it is designed to run each test five times, then take the
      average.  The machine should have no other users or activity going on, and
      you should disable the screen saver.  You can disable the screensaver
      either with the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xset s off</B
> or by killing the
      process called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"xscreensaver"</SPAN
>.  You may need to run both
      commands in order to turn off the screen saver.
    </P
><P
>      Testing with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>x11perf</B
> will take several hours depending
      on the speed of your CPU and graphics card.  Once complete, you will have
      a log file that you can then compare against other machines that have also
      done testing, or against a baseline test you ran before tuning to see if
      the X server speed has been improved.  To do this comparison, you can use
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>x11perfcomp</B
> to compare two or more tests.  Higher
      numbers are better, as the resulting numbers are in terms of objects per
      second.
    </P
><P
>      You can test out 3D performance using applications like Quake III, that
      run the application through a set world and events, most of which will
      stress the system.  Mark down the resolution, bit depth, and frames per
      second reported from Quake III, and you now have a baseline to work from.
    </P
><P
>      A caveat to using Quake or 3D applications is that this is testing more
      than the video card.  Other subsystems, like the CPU, video drivers, GLX
      (3D) drivers, and memory are also tested.  If you want to use this method
      for comparing speed, you should also be sure the other subsystems are
      tuned as well.
