The system wasn't booting yet. Since we were working with C code, we traced the code, and found that a function called <code class="function">sdram_size()</code> wasn't completing correctly.  The function probed a register for the size of the RAM, a register our board doesn't have.  We made the function return a given value of 128MB, it's an ugly hack, but our board doesn't have a way of knowing the amount of RAM.</p><p>Wwe had the same problems with a bunch of functions called todc_XXXX, mainly
<code class="function">todc_get_rtc_time()</code>, <code class="function">todc_set_rtc_time()</code>, and <code class="function">time_init()</code> since we don't have a RTC (real-time clock) chip on our board, and those functions were using it. For the time being, we made the <code class="function">todc_XXX</code> function only set and get a constant date and time, since our board doesn't have a bios battery and so cannot keep time when powered off.</p><p>Once all this was done, we found <code class="function">todc_calibrate_descr()</code>, which again uses the RTC chip. We had to replace that function with our own:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

void calibrate_decr() {
	int freq, divisor;
	freq = bus_freq();
	divisor = 4;
	tb_ticks_per_jiffy = freq / HZ / divisor;
	tb_to_us = mulhwu_scale_factor(freq / divisor, 1000000);
}
