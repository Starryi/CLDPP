However,
the recommended way of working is having a third host which acts as a server. The server
runs several services such as ftp, telnet, NFS, tftp (if needed) and CVS. The main role of
the server is to run CVS and track version control, however once you can boot the target
from network, the server will also hold the target images, and filesystem,
which makes development much easier.</p><p>Regardless, the first step is to install a tool-chain (compiler, linker etc.) for your 
target. The HardHat Linux cdrom includes all the needed files, and the installation sequence
is documented in the HardHat Linux documentation. During the installation, you must select 
your LSP (basic software for the selected board), and HardHat will install a set of tools 
and a kernel source tree matching your LSP.</p><p>We had a board that had vxWorks running on it, so we setup the target to boot 
using the standard vxWorks loader. Once the loader initiated, we used visionICE to take-over 
the target (so that vxWorks won't load an image file) and load a Linux image into the target. 
What you need to do at this point is get an ICE, connect it to the network and to the target -
through a JTAG connection - and install the ICE software on your host.</p><p>What should have been done so far:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A Linux host installed, and the HardHat tool-chain.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A working target (hardware should be functional)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ICE is connected to the target and the network and its software usable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Optionally, a server running CVS, telnetd, NFS and FTP.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm136"></a>2. Compiling the first kernel</h2></div></div></div><p>If you've installed the Linux kernel that comes with HardHat, then cross-compiling
should already be enabled in the kernel <code class="filename">Makefile</code>. If your
kernel is not from the HardHat CD, you should enable cross-compiling in the
<code class="filename">Makefile</code> by defining a CROSS_COMPILE entry in the following manner:
(a code segment from the main Makefile)</p><pre class="programlisting">

CROSS_COMPILE 	= /opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/7xx/bin/ppc_7xx-
AS		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)as
LD		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
CC		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc

</pre><p>The Linux kernel is modular, and allows you to configure it and choose which <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">blocks</span>&#8221;</span> 
should be compiled with the kernel. In order to do this, first <span class="command"><strong>cd /usr/src/linux</strong></span>
(assuming your kernel source code is installed at /usr/src/linux). Once there, type
<span class="command"><strong>make xconfig</strong></span>.After saving your options, you should <span class="command"><strong>make vmlinux</strong></span>
to create a kernel image suitably for using with VisionICE.</p><p>We will not go into more details here, as it's outside the scope of this document.

the following way: 9600 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow control of any kind.
The serial port in Linux should be <code class="filename">/dev/ttyS0</code> for <code class="envar">COM1</code>,
<code class="filename">/dev/ttyS1</code> for <code class="envar">COM2</code> etc.</p><p>Start the target. You should see the vxWorks bootloader on your terminal screen, and
should be able to stop the boot sequence by pressing the space bar.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>We <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot use the vxWorks bootloader to load a Linux kernel</em></span> since
it looks in the ELF header and loads the image to the address written there. However, the Linux
kernel, which uses virtual memory, is linked to a high-memory address, and vxWorks can't
handle that.</p></div><p>Once the target is stopped, run the <span class="application">VisionICE</span> software
and perform the following steps:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Initialize the target by pressing <span class="command"><strong>Target|Initialize</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Press <span class="command"><strong>File|Load Executable</strong></span>.

   asking you to choose a file. Please choose your kernel image (vmlinux). Before pressing
   <span class="command"><strong>Load</strong></span>, don't forget to enter a value in the <em class="parameter"><code>+/- Bias</code></em> field.
   </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>The bias field makes it possible to tell ICE to load a certain image in a different
   address than what's stated in the ELF binary. We wanted to load the kernel into address
   <code class="envar">0x300000</code>, and since the binary was linked to <code class="envar">0xC0000000</code>, we entered
   <code class="envar">-0xBFD00000</code>.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once the image is loaded succesfully, you can press <span class="command"><strong>Run</strong></span>
   or <span class="command"><strong>Step</strong></span> to start executing your kernel.</p></li></ul></div><p>

After pressing the <span class="command"><strong>Run</strong></span> button, nothing happened. At that moment, and for some time after, it
seemed that nothing was happening and the kernel was stuck. We used ICE to step through the
initialization code of the kernel and rule out some potential problems, like virtual memory
errors, only to finally discover that the problem was simple: the kernel was indeed booting
but since the console (tty) driver had problems, we couldn't see anything!

</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>VisionICE is not the correct tool to use when debugging Linux. ICE doesn't know
about virtual memory and protected mode (at least the version we had), and since the Linux
kernel turns on virtual memory very early, ICE is only useful for debugging the first assembler
statements. After VM is turned on, ICE starts crashing and giving wierd results. </p></div><p>

At least, nothing
that we can see. The screen is blank and no kernel messages appear. At this point, you have to ask yourself,
is it really booting?</p><p>Since the console wouldn't start, and ICE died real fast, we had no choice. We had to debug somehow,
and the oldest way is good here - printing to the screen. Obviously, we couldn't use <code class="function">printk()</code>, so we wrote a short function which pushes characters straight into the serial port. We used the boot process <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">map</span>&#8221;</span> shown in the previous section, and inserted some prints along the way. This helped us to know at what stage we are completing and where we're dying. The following piece of code prints a single character to the serial port, by polling it and waiting for it to be free.

</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>There's a better code for printing directly to the serial port, however, it's a bit
more complicated. You can find it in arch/ppc/boot/common/misc-common.c, using <code class="function">puts()</code> or 
<code class="function">putc()</code>.</p></div><p>

first time. The Linux kernel uses standard configuration flags CONFIG_XXXX (like CONFIG_PPC, CONFIG_ISA etc),
which are used to mark a certain machine, architecture or device. We defined ourselves a new flag (let's call
it CONFIG_TESTMACH), and surrounded our new/modified code with these flags:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

....original code....
#ifdef CONFIG_TESTMACH
....modified code....
#else
....original code....
#endif /* CONFIG_TESTMACH */

</pre><p>

To <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">activate</span>&#8221;</span> our code, we added the new flag to the kernel configuration file - <code class="filename">.config</code> -
by adding <span class="command"><strong>CONFIG_TESTMACH=y</strong></span> to it. In the first stage, this solution allows you a quick
way to find the code you changed, but later the flag you chose will allow you to add your code into the
kernel tree and into the configuration program (<span class="command"><strong>make xconfig</strong></span>).</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm205"></a>3. Getting the console to work</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm207"></a>3.1. Forcing the kernel to boot our-way</h3></div></div></div><p>Once we discovered the kernel was indeed booting, but the console wasn't printing, it was time to begin.
First, we forced the kernel to boot using a specified configuration for the serial port,
in our case <code class="envar">9600n1</code>, and did not allow any command line options or boot time considerations etc.</p><p>The first place to go is <code class="filename">drivers/char/tty_io.c</code>, to <code class="function">console_init()</code>.
This function determines the console configuration at startup. Here's a small part of it:

we (again, naively) thought. So we tried to stop the kernel from parsing command-line options, and manually

So we dove a bit deeper into the console
issues. Looking at <code class="filename">drivers/char/serial.c</code>, 
we came across <code class="function">serial_console_setup()</code>. This function, apart from parsing command-line
options, also configures the serial port by writing directly to it. Our hardware people 
decided it was a good time to let us know that our serial port wasn't standard. The lines that are used for
flow control were not connected.  We decided to remark-out the following line, which sets the RTS and DTR
lines high, because we just didn't have them.

Did Linux mean what we thought it meant when it said
9600? Possibly not, since we didn't know how it computed that value. We've noticed that the file(s)
<code class="filename">include/asm-ppc/pmppc_serial.h</code>  (replace pmppc with your board name) included a definition
of <code class="envar">BAUDBASE</code>, which is later used for everything regarding serial ports. It was computed
using the board's local bus frequency, bus clock to system clock ratio etc. This seemed wrong, so we checked 
out what the base baud was in a vxWorks system we had running on the board, and changed it to:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

/*
 * system clock = 33Mhz, serial clock = system clock / 4
 * the following must hold: (divisor * BaudRate) == (System clock / 64)
 */
#define BASE_BAUD (33000000 / 4 / 16)

A quick compilation, and a reboot later we had a booting kernel visible through our serial port.  Success!

The system wasn't booting yet. Since we were working with C code, we traced the code, and found that a function called <code class="function">sdram_size()</code> wasn't completing correctly.  The function probed a register for the size of the RAM, a register our board doesn't have.  We made the function return a given value of 128MB, it's an ugly hack, but our board doesn't have a way of knowing the amount of RAM.</p><p>Wwe had the same problems with a bunch of functions called todc_XXXX, mainly
<code class="function">todc_get_rtc_time()</code>, <code class="function">todc_set_rtc_time()</code>, and <code class="function">time_init()</code> since we don't have a RTC (real-time clock) chip on our board, and those functions were using it. For the time being, we made the <code class="function">todc_XXX</code> function only set and get a constant date and time, since our board doesn't have a bios battery and so cannot keep time when powered off.</p><p>Once all this was done, we found <code class="function">todc_calibrate_descr()</code>, which again uses the RTC chip. We had to replace that function with our own:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

	int freq, divisor;
	freq = bus_freq();
	divisor = 4;
	tb_ticks_per_jiffy = freq / HZ / divisor;

We tried communicating with the CPC700 using <code class="function">cpc700_read_local_pci_cfgb()</code>, which was supplied along with the PMPPC's LSP, and tried to read CPC's config register.  We should have gotten <code class="envar">0x1014</code>, which is the vendor ID, but we didn't. We realized that we were talking little-endian and the CPC was listening in big-endian. We made a small patch to the functions, so that we spoke big-endian to the CPC700.  We could then read the vendor ID correctly, but the rest of it still didn't work.

</p><pre class="programlisting">

A short compilation later, PCI probing was working! We got some beer and partied ;-)</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idm259"></a>3. Ethernet: our first PCI device</h2></div></div></div><p>Our board uses an Intel ethernet chip, called i82559er, which has a module called <span class="emphasis"><em>eepro100</em></span>. After compiling the module and booting, we discovered that the module isn't working, although an ethernet device was found. We guessed that it was an irq problem, and that the devices don't get the IRQs they need.  We modified a function called <code class="function">pmppc_map_irq()</code> to map our ethernet devices:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

XXXX_map_irq(struct pci_dev *dev, unsigned char idsel, unsigned char pin) {
	static char pci_irq_table[][4] =
	/*
	 *      PCI IDSEL/INTPIN-&gt;INTLINE
	 *      A       B       C       D
	 */
	{
		{22,    0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 3 - Ethernet */
		{0,     0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 4 - unused   */
		{0,     0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 5 - unused   */
		{0,     0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 6 - ????     */
		{0,     0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 7 - unused   */
		{0,     0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 8 - unused   */
		{0,     0,      0,      0},/* IDSEL 9 - unused   */
	};

	const long min_idsel = 3, max_idsel = 9, irqs_per_slot = 4;
	return PCI_IRQ_TABLE_LOOKUP;
}

</pre><p>

The function maps IRQs according to IDselects, which means in the order on the PCI bus by which the devices are set. This structure is a bit tricky: <span class="emphasis"><em>min_idsel</em></span> denotes the topleft corner of the array, and <span class="emphasis"><em>max_idsel</em></span> is the bottomleft corner. <span class="emphasis"><em>irqs_per_slot</em></span> is the number of IRQs per line. The structure is as follows:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

each cell contains (IDSEL, SLOT#, IRQ)
		+----------------------------------------+
		| (3,0,22) | (3,1,0) | (3,2,0) | (3,3,0) |

		| (4,0,0)  | (4,1,0) | (4,2,0) | (4,3,0) |

		| (9,0,0)  | (9,1,0) | (9,2,0) | (9,3,0) |
		+----------------------------------------+

</pre><p>

As you can see, our i8559er needs IRQ 22, and is seated in IDselect 3. Of course, we didn't know that at the start, so we wrote a small piece of code that read all the vendor IDs in all the IDselects.  Once done we compiled, but the ethernet device still didn't work.</p><p>The next problem was that the module couldn't decide on a MAC address for the device. The MAC address should be written on an EEPROM chip (connected to the device), but we discovered that the hardware guys decided that i82559 doesn't need the EEPROM, so they removed it.  After hardcoding a MAC address inside <code class="filename">eepro100.c</code>, the ethernet device finally worked.  The final solution was to make the module read the MAC address from NVRAM memory, and if no other choice was available, to fall back to a default MAC address.

We didn't have a bootloader yet, however we needed to pass a command line to the kernel at boot time.  We hard-coded the command line into the kernel inside the <code class="function">parse_options()</code>. After that was finished, we made <code class="function">console_init()</code> and <code class="function">serial_console_setup()</code> work the way they should.  They no longer ignored the command line, but still RTS and DTR stay low.</p><p>Another important issue was memory mapping. The file <code class="filename">arch/ppc/mm/init.c</code> contains a function called <code class="function">MMU_init()</code>. This function is actually a big <span class="command"><strong>switch</strong></span> statment, divided by the machine type. Each machine maps its memory using the <code class="function">setbat()</code> and <code class="function">ioremap()</code> functions. The BAT mechanism is a way of translating virtual addresses into physical ones. Thus, <code class="function">setbat()</code> is used by specifying a virtual address, a physical address and a page size.  Not every size can be used here; you should use one of the finite set of sizes, ranging from 128KB to 256MB.  We mapped our IO memory so that virtual equalled physical.</p><p>As mentioned, there is another way of mapping memory - <code class="function">ioremap()</code>. <code class="function">ioremap()</code> is used to map physical addresses into virtual ones, making them available to the kernel. The function <span class="emphasis"><em>does not allocate any memory</em></span>, simply returns a virtual address by which one can access the memory region. The following is a snippet from <code class="function">MMU_init()</code>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

case _MACH_mymachine:
	setbat(0, LOW_IO_VIRT_BASE, LOW_IO_PHYS_BASE, LOW_IO_SIZE, IO_PAGE);
	ioremap(UNIVERSE_BASE,UNIVERSE_SIZE);      /* Universe VME */
	ioremap(EEPRO100_BASE,EEPRO100_SIZE);      /* Ethernet EEPRO100 */
	break;

</pre><p>

As you can see,  we don't take the return value of <code class="function">ioremap()</code>. We don't need it,  since at this stage the kernel maps the addresses so that virtual address == physical address.</p></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="idm293"></a>Chapter 5. Linux Is Booting ...

This is a problem since some test-and-set registers on our board might get set unintentionally, because we were trying to read something 16 bits lower. In order to solve this situation, we set the memory controller to 64 bit wide intervals.  If you try to access those areas in another manner (8 or 16 bit access), the CPC700 simply throws them away.  We had to be able to read/write those areas, since important <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">discretes</span>&#8221;</span> (controlled by an Altera device) were mapped there.</p><p>In order to access those areas, we needed a function that does a 64 bit write.  As far as I know, doing a 64 bit write on a PowerPC is possible in two ways:  using cache lines and using a floating point register.  The floating point register is a 64 bit sized register, so when we write it, the whole 64 bit get written. The problem is that you can't do floating point in the kernel. Since the kernel doesn't save the floating point registers during context switch, it doesn't allow FP, and will throw an exception if done in the kernel.</p><p>After messing with cache lines, we decided to go the FP way, and added the following function:

</p><pre class="programlisting">

void out64(__u32 addr, long long *pVal) {
	__u32 flags, tmp_msr;

	save_flags(flags);
	cli();
	tmp_msr = __get_MSR();
	tmp_msr |= MSR_FP;
	tmp_msr &amp;= ~(MSR_FE0 | MSR_FE1);
	__put_MSR(tmp_msr);

	sysOut64(addr, pVal);
	__put_MSR(flags &amp; ~(MSR_EE));
	restore_flags(flags);
}

</pre><p>

The function adds a floating point to the PowerPC MSR register, and makes sure that no exceptions will be generated as a result of doing FP. Once done, it uses an assembly code, described below in the <code class="function">sysOut64()</code> to do the actual floating-point operation. Note that the function turns off interrupts, but this is acceptable here, since we use the function on rare occasion.

</p><pre class="programlisting">

For an actual field product, we needed Linux to boot from an independent device, without the need for a network at all.  We decided to create a special kind of image, called <span class="emphasis"><em>initrd</em></span>, which is basically a Linux kernel with a compressed file. The compressed file includes a Linux filesystem.  The filesystem is unpacked to a ramdisk on boot, and mounted as the root filesystem.</p><p>During the boot process, the bootloader relocated the kernel image to address zero - which was fine, and the initrd part to a higher address.  The area to which initrd was relocated was not mapped in our kernel's memory, and all we got was a kernel error (access to bad area).  After modifying the bootloader to relocate initrd to a different address, all was fine and Linux booted succesfully.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>If your board has some NVRAM memory, it would be a good idea to use it for bootloader purposes.

When the bootloader starts, it checks NVRAM and if it is initialized (by a certain magic number), the bootloader uses the command line written there. Otherwise, the bootloader reverts to a default command line, allowing the user to edit it.</p></div></div></div><div class="appendix"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="gfdl"></a>Appendix A. GNU Free Documentation License</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#gfdl-0">1.

    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-3"></a>4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h2></div></div></div><p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-4"></a>5. MODIFICATIONS</h2></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</p></li></ol></div><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-5"></a>6. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h2></div></div></div><p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-6"></a>7. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h2></div></div></div><p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-7"></a>8. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h2></div></div></div><p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-8"></a>9. TRANSLATION</h2></div></div></div><p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-9"></a>10. TERMINATION</h2></div></div></div><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-10"></a>11. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h2></div></div></div><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gfdl-11"></a>12. How to use this License for your documents</h2></div></div></div><p>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</p></blockquote></div><p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</p><p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
