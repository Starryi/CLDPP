			<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

			it.</P
><P
>Now the question is, how do you get a major number without hijacking one that's already in use?  The easiest way
			would be to look through <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Documentation/devices.txt</TT

			things because you'll never be sure if the number you picked will be assigned later.  The answer is that you can ask the
			kernel to assign you a dynamic major number.</P
><P
>If you pass a major number of 0 to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>register_chrdev</CODE
>, the return value will be the dynamically
			allocated major number.  The downside is that you can't make a device file in advance, since you don't know what the major
			number will be.  There are a couple of ways to do this.  First, the driver itself can print the newly assigned number and
			we can make the device file by hand.  Second, the newly registered device will have an entry in
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/devices</TT
>, and we can either make the device file by hand or write a shell script to read the
			file in and make the device file.  The third method is we can have our driver make the device file using the
			<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>mknod</CODE
> system call after a successful registration and rm during the call to
			<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cleanup_module</CODE

>We can't allow the kernel module to be <SPAN

			device file is opened by a process and then we remove the kernel module, using the file would cause a call to the memory
			location where the appropriate function (read/write) used to be.  If we're lucky, no other code was loaded there, and
			we'll get an ugly error message.  If we're unlucky, another kernel module was loaded into the same location, which means a
			jump into the middle of another function within the kernel.  The results of this would be impossible to predict, but they

>The system calls, which are the major interface the kernel shows to the processes, generally stay the same across
			versions. A new system call may be added, but usually the old ones will behave exactly like they used to. This is
			necessary for backward compatibility -- a new kernel version is not supposed to break regular processes. In most cases,
			the device files will also remain the same. On the other hand, the internal interfaces within the kernel can and do change
			between versions.</P
><P
>The Linux kernel versions are divided between the stable versions (n.$&#60;$even number$&#62;$.m) and the development
			versions (n.$&#60;$odd number$&#62;$.m). The development versions include all the cool new ideas, including those which will
			be considered a mistake, or reimplemented, in the next version. As a result, you can't trust the interface to remain the
			same in those versions (which is why I don't bother to support them in this book, it's too much work and it would become
			dated too quickly). In the stable versions, on the other hand, we can expect the interface to remain the same regardless
			of the bug fix version (the m number).</P
><P
>There are differences between different kernel versions, and if you want to support multiple kernel versions, you'll
			find yourself having to code conditional compilation directives.  The way to do this to compare the macro
			<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>LINUX_VERSION_CODE</CODE
> to the macro <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>KERNEL_VERSION</CODE
>.  In version <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>a.b.c</CODE
>
			of the kernel, the value of this macro would be $2^{16}a+2^{8}b+c$. </P
><P
>			While previous versions of this guide showed how you can write backward compatible code with such constructs in
			great detail, we decided to break with this tradition for the better. People interested in doing such
			might now use a LKMPG with a version matching to their kernel. We decided to version the LKMPG like the kernel, 
			at least as far as major and minor number are concerned. We use the patchlevel for our own versioning so
			use LKMPG version 2.4.x for kernels 2.4.x, use LKMPG version 2.6.x for kernels 2.6.x and so on.
			Also make sure that you always use current, up to date versions of both, kernel and guide.
			</P
><P
> Update: What we've said above was true for kernels up to and including 2.6.10. You might already
			have noticed that recent kernels look different. In case you haven't they look like 2.6.x.y now.
			The meaning of the first three items basically stays the same, but a subpatchlevel has been added and will
			indicate security fixes till the next stable patchlevel is out. So people can choose between a stable
			tree with security updates <EM
> and </EM
> use the latest kernel as developer tree.
			Search the kernel mailing list archives	if you're interested in the full story.
