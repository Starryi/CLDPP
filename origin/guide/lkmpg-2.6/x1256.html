>                Except for the last chapter, everything we did in the kernel so far we've done as a response to a process 
                asking for it, either by dealing with a special file, sending an <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl()</CODE
>, or issuing 
                a system call.  But the job of the kernel isn't just to respond to process requests.  Another job, which 
                is every bit as important, is to speak to the hardware connected to the machine.

>There are two types of interaction between the CPU and the rest of the computer's hardware.
                The first type is when the CPU gives orders to the hardware, the other is when the hardware needs to tell 
                the CPU something.  The second, called interrupts, is much harder to implement because it has to be dealt 
                with when convenient for the hardware, not the CPU. Hardware devices typically have a very small amount of 
                RAM, and if you don't read their information when available, it is lost.
                </P

>                Under Linux, hardware interrupts are called IRQ's (<EM

>.  There are two types of IRQ's, short and long.  A short IRQ is one which 
                is expected to take a <EM
>very</EM
> short period of time, during which the rest of the machine 
                will be blocked and no other interrupts will be handled.  A long IRQ is one which can take longer, and during
                which other interrupts may occur (but not interrupts from the same device).  If at all possible, it's better
                to declare an interrupt handler to be long.
                </P
><P
>                When the CPU receives an interrupt, it stops whatever it's doing (unless it's processing a more important
                interrupt, in which case it will deal with this one only when the more important one is done), saves certain 
                parameters on the stack and calls the interrupt handler.  This means that certain things are not allowed 
                in the interrupt handler itself, because the system is in an unknown state.  The solution to this problem
                is for the interrupt handler to do what needs to be done immediately, usually read something from the hardware
                or send something to the hardware, and then schedule the handling of the new information at a later time 
                (this is called the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bottom half"</SPAN
>) and return.  The kernel is then	guaranteed to call the bottom
                half as soon as possible -- and when it does, everything allowed in kernel modules will be allowed.
                </P

>                The way to implement this is to call <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

>This function receives the IRQ number, the name of the function, flags, 
                a name for <TT

>/proc/interrupts</TT
> and a parameter to pass to the interrupt handler. Usually 
                there is a certain number of IRQs available. How many IRQs there are is hardware-dependent. The flags can 
                include <CODE
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>SA_SHIRQ</CODE
> to indicate you're willing to share the IRQ with other interrupt 
                handlers (usually because a number of hardware devices sit on the same IRQ) and <CODE
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>SA_INTERRUPT
                </CODE
> to indicate this is a fast interrupt.  This function will only succeed if there isn't already 
                a handler on this IRQ, or if you're both willing to share.
                </P

>                Then, from within the interrupt handler, we communicate with the hardware and then use <CODE

> <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

>                I had a problem with writing the sample code for this chapter.  On one hand, for an example to be useful
                it has to run on everybody's computer with meaningful results.  On the other hand, the kernel already 
                includes device drivers for all of the common devices, and those device drivers won't coexist with what 
                I'm going to write.  The solution I've found was to write something for the keyboard interrupt, and disable
                the regular keyboard interrupt handler first.  Since it is defined as a static symbol in the kernel source
                files (specifically, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>drivers/char/keyboard.c</TT
>), there is no way to restore it. Before 
                <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>insmod</KBD
>'ing this code, do on another terminal <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>sleep 120; reboot</KBD
>
                if you value your file system.
                </P
><P
>                This code binds itself to IRQ 1, which is the IRQ of the keyboard controlled under Intel architectures.
                Then, when it receives a keyboard interrupt, it reads the keyboard's status (that's the purpose of the
                <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>inb(0x64)</KBD
>) and the scan code, which is the value returned by the keyboard. Then, 
                as soon as the kernel thinks it's feasible, it runs <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>got_char</CODE
> which gives the code 
                of the key used (the first seven bits of the scan code) and whether it has been pressed (if the 8th bit
                is zero) or released (if it's one).

>In practice IRQ handling can be a bit more 
                complex. Hardware is often designed in a way that chains two interrupt controllers, so that all the IRQs
                from interrupt controller B are cascaded to a certain IRQ from interrupt controller A. Of course that 
                requires that the kernel finds out which IRQ it really was afterwards and that adds overhead. Other 
                architectures offer some special, very low overhead, so called "fast IRQ" or FIQs. To take advantage 
                of them requires handlers to be written in assembler, so they do not really fit into the kernel. They 
                can be made to work similar to the others, but after that procedure, they're no longer any faster than 
                "common" IRQs. SMP enabled kernels running on systems with more than one processor need to solve another
                truckload of problems. It's not enough to know if a certain IRQs has happend, it's also important for 
                what CPU(s) it was for. People still interested in more details, might want to do a web search for 
                "APIC" now ;)</P
