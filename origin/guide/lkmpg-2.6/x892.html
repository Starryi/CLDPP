></H1
><P
>Device files are supposed to represent physical devices. Most physical devices are used for output as well as input, so
	there has to be some mechanism for device drivers in the kernel to get the output to send to the device from processes. This
	is done by opening the device file for output and writing to it, just like writing to a file. In the following example, this
	is implemented by <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>device_write</CODE
>.</P
><P
>This is not always enough. Imagine you had a serial port connected to a modem (even if you have an internal modem, it is
	still implemented from the CPU's perspective as a serial port connected to a modem, so you don't have to tax your imagination
	too hard). The natural thing to do would be to use the device file to write things to the modem (either modem commands or data
	to be sent through the phone line) and read things from the modem (either responses for commands or the data received through
	the phone line). However, this leaves open the question of what to do when you need to talk to the serial port itself, for
	example to send the rate at which data is sent and received.</P
><P
>The answer in Unix is to use a special function called <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
> (short for Input Output ConTroL).
	Every device can have its own <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
> commands, which can be read <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
>'s (to send
	information from a process to the kernel), write <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
>'s (to return information to a process),

> both or neither.  The <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
> function is called with three parameters: the file
	descriptor of the appropriate device file, the ioctl number, and a parameter, which is of type long so you can use a cast to
	use it to pass anything.  <A

>The ioctl number encodes the major device number, the type of the ioctl, the command, and the type of the parameter.
	This ioctl number is usually created by a macro call (<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>_IO</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>_IOR</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>_IOW</CODE
>
	or <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>_IOWR</CODE
> --- depending on the type) in a header file. This header file should then be included both by the
	programs which will use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
> (so they can generate the appropriate <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
>'s) and by
	the kernel module (so it can understand it). In the example below, the header file is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chardev.h</TT
> and the program which uses it is <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl.c</CODE
>.</P
><P
>If you want to use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
>s in your own kernel modules, it is best to receive an official
	<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
> assignment, so if you accidentally get somebody else's <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</CODE
>s, or if they get
	yours, you'll know something is wrong. For more information, consult the kernel source tree at
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Documentation/ioctl-number.txt</TT
>.</P
