  This directory is reserved for all the software and add-on packages 
  that are not part of the default installation. For example, StarOffice, 
  Kylix, Netscape Communicator and WordPerfect packages are normally 
  found here. To comply with the FSSTND, all third party applications
  should be installed in this directory. Any package to be installed 
  here must locate its static files (ie. extra fonts, clipart, database 
  files)  must locate its static files in a separate /opt/'package'
  or /opt/'provider' directory tree (similar to the way in which Windows
  will install new software to its own directory tree 
  C:\Program Files\"Program Name"), where 'package' is a name that
  describes the software package and 'provider' is the provider's LANANA
  registered name.
  </p><p>
  Although most distributions neglect to create the directories /opt/bin,
  /opt/doc, /opt/include, /opt/info, /opt/lib, and /opt/man they are 
  reserved for local system administrator use. Packages may provide 
  "front-end" files intended to be placed in (by linking or copying) 
  these reserved directories by the system administrator, but must function
  normally in the absence of these reserved directories. Programs to be
  invoked by users are located in the directory /opt/'package'/bin. If 
  the package includes UNIX manual pages, they are located in /opt/'package'/man 
  and the same substructure as /usr/share/man must be used. Package files 
  that are variable must be installed in /var/opt. Host-specific 
  configuration files are installed in /etc/opt.
  </p><p>
  Under no circumstances are other package files to exist outside 
  the /opt, /var/opt, and /etc/opt hierarchies except for those package 
  files that must reside in specific locations within the filesystem tree 
  in order to function properly. For example, device lock files in /var/lock 
  and devices in /dev. Distributions may install software in /opt, but must 
  not modify or delete software installed by the local system administrator
  without the assent of the local system administrator.
  </p><p>
  The use of /opt for add-on software is a well-established practice 
  in the UNIX community. The System V Application Binary Interface 
  [AT&amp;T 1990], based on the System V Interface Definition (Third Edition) 
  and the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard v. 2 (iBCS2) provides for an 
  /opt structure very similar to the one defined here.
  </p><p>
  Generally, all data required to support a package on a system 
  must be present within /opt/'package', including files intended 
  to be copied into /etc/opt/'package' and /var/opt/'package' 
  as well as reserved directories in /opt. The minor restrictions on 
  distributions using /opt are necessary because conflicts are possible
  between distribution installed and locally installed software, especially 
  in the case of fixed pathnames found in some binary software.
  </p><p>
  The structure of the directories below /opt/'provider' is left up to the
  packager of the software, though it is recommended that packages are
  installed in /opt/'provider'/'package' and follow a similar structure to
  the guidelines for /opt/package. A valid reason for diverging from this
  structure is for support packages which may have files installed in /opt/
  'provider'/lib or /opt/'provider'/bin.
