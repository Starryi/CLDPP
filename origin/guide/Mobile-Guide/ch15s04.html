   Although it is certainly not their main aim, version management software
   like CVS (Concurrent Version System) are a perfect tool when you work on
   several machines and you have trouble keeping them in sync (something
   which is often called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">disconnected filesystems</span>&#8221;</span> in the
   computer science literature).  Unlike programs like
   <span class="command"><strong>rsync</strong></span>, which are asymmetric (one side is the master
   and its files override those of the slave), CVS accept that you make
   changes on several machines, and try afterwards to merge them.
   Asymmetric tools are good only when you can respect a strict discipline,
   when you switch from one machine to another. On the contrary, tools like
   CVS are more forgetful.
</p><p>
   To synchronize two or more machines (typically a desktop and a laptop),
   just choose a CVS repository somewhere on the network. It can be on one
   of the machines you want to synchronize or on a third host. Anyway, this
   machine should be easily reachable via the network and have good disks.
</p><p>
   Then, <span class="command"><strong>cvs co</strong></span> the module you want to work on, edit it,
   and <span class="command"><strong>cvs commit</strong></span> when you reached a synch point and are
   connected. If you made changes on both hosts, CVS will try to merge them
   (it typically succeeds automatically) or give in and ask you to resolve
   it by hand.
</p><p>
   The typical limits of this solution: CVS does not deal well with binary
   files, so this solution is more for users of vi or emacs than for GIMP
   fans. CVS has trouble with some <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> goodies like
   symbolic links.
</p><p>
   For more information on CVS, see the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html" target="_top">Web page</a>
   . The CVS documentation is excellent (in info format).

   The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_top">CODA</a> File
   System is a descendant of the Andrew File System. Like AFS, Coda
   offers location-transparent access to a shared
   <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> file name-space that is mapped on to a
   collection of dedicated file servers. But Coda represents a
   substantial improvement over AFS because it offers considerably
   higher availability in the face of server and network failures. The
   improvement in availability is achieved using the complementary
   techniques of server replication and disconnected operation.
   Disconnected operation proven especially valuable in supporting
   portable computers .

   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/" target="_top">unison</a>
   is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and
   Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories
   to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
   modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
   changes in each replica to the other.
   Unison was written by researchers with an eye for well-defined
   replication semantics: they were very fussy about safety, and made
   sure to handle gracefully things like premature termination etc.
   Unison is symmetric/bidirectional (unlike rsync), works fine with
   binaries (unlike cvs), and is a user-level program (unlike most
   distributed filesystems).  It also makes a reasonable attempt to
   synchronize transparently between Unix/Linux and Windows filesystems,
   which is no small feat.  Drawbacks: it does not do version control,
   and does not handle synchronization among more than 2 file trees.
   <span class="command"><strong>unison</strong></span> shares a number
   of features with tools such as configuration management packages
   (<span class="command"><strong>CVS</strong></span>, 
   <span class="command"><strong>PRCS</strong></span>, 
   etc.) distributed filesystems (

   <span class="emphasis"><em>uni-directional</em></span> mirroring utilities
   (<span class="command"><strong>rsync</strong></span>, etc.) and other
   synchronizers (
   Intellisync,

   number of points where it differs: 
</p><p>

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>unison</strong></span> runs on both MicroSoft-Windows (95, 98, NT, and 2k) and

   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/feed.html" target="_top">TuxMobil IPK feed</a>
   . Moreover,
   <span class="command"><strong>unison</strong></span> works <span class="emphasis"><em>across</em></span> platforms,
   allowing you to synchronize a Microsoft-Windows laptop with a Unix server, for
   example.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Unlike a distributed filesystem, <span class="command"><strong>unison</strong></span> is a
   user-level program: there is no need to hack (or own!) the kernel,

   Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities,
   <span class="command"><strong>unison</strong></span> can deal with updates to both replicas of
   a distributed directory structure. Updates that do not conflict are
   propagated automatically. Conflicting updates are detected and
   displayed.

   <a class="ulink" href="http://inter-mezzo.org/" target="_top">InterMezzo</a>
   is a new distributed file system with a focus on
   high availability.  InterMezzo is an Open Source
   project, currently on Linux (2.2 and 2.3).  A
   primary target of development is to provide
   support for flexible replication of directories,
   with disconnected operation and a persistent
   cache.  For example, we want to make it easy to
   manage copies of home directories on multiple
   computers, and solve the laptop/desktop
   synchronization problems. On a larger scale we aim
   to provide replication of large file repositories,
   for example to support high availability for
   servers.  InterMezzo was deeply inspired
   by the Coda File System, but totally
   re-designed and re-engineered.

   It has many more options than <span class="command"><strong>rcp</strong></span>, and uses the

   Xfiles is an interactive utility for comparing and merging one file tree
   with another over a network. It supports freeform work on several
   machines (no need to keep track of what files are changed on which
   machine). Xfiles can also be used as a cross-validating disk &lt;-&gt;
   disk backup strategy (portions of a disk may go bad at any time, with no
   simple indication of which files were affected. Cross-validate against a
   second disk before backup to make sure you aren't backing up bad data).
</p><p>
   A client/server program (GUI on the client) traverses a file tree and
   reports any files that are missing on the server machine, missing on the
   client machine, or different. For each such file, the file size/sizes and
   modification date(s) are shown, and a comparison (using
   <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> diff) can be obtained. For files that are missing
   from one tree, <span class="emphasis"><em>similarly named</em></span> files in that tree
   are reported. Inconsistent files can then be copied in either direction
   or deleted on either machine. The file trees do not need to be accessible
   via nfs. Files checksums are computed in parallel, so largely similar
   trees can be compared over a slow network link. The client and server
   processes can also be run on the same machine. File selection and
   interaction with a revision control system such as RCS can be handled by
   scripting using jpython. Requirements Java1.1 or later and JFC/Swing1.1
   are needed.

   Sitecopy is for copying locally stored websites to remote web servers.
   The program will upload files to the server which have changed locally,
   and delete files from the server which have been removed locally, to
   keep the remote site synchronized with the local site, with a single
   command. The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading and deleting
   individual files using an FTP client.
