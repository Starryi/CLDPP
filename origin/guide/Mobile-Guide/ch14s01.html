   PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) is an
   international standards body and trade association with over 200 member companies
   that was founded in 1989 to establish standards for Integrated Circuit cards and to
   promote interchangeability among mobile computers where ruggedness, low power,
   and small size were critical. As the needs of mobile computer users have changed, so
   has the PC Card Standard. By 1991, PCMCIA had defined an I/O interface for the
   same 68 pin connector initially used for memory cards. At the same time, the Socket
   Services Specification was added and was soon followed by the Card Services
   Specifcation as developers realized that common software would be needed to
   enhance compatibility.
   </span>&#8221;</span>
   The cards are available in different formats: Type I, II, III.
</p><p>
   A quotation from the <code class="filename">../Documentation/Changes</code> file:
   "PCMCIA (PC Card) support is now partially implemented in the main
   kernel source. Pay attention when you recompile your kernel.  If you
   need to use the <span class="command"><strong>PCMCIA-CS</strong></span> modules, then don't compile
   the kernel's PCMCIA support. If you don't need to use the PCMCIA-CS
   modules (i.e. all the drivers you need are in the kernel sources), then
   don't compile them; you won't need anything in there.  Also, be sure to
   upgrade to the latest <span class="command"><strong>PCMCIA-CS</strong></span> release." Further
   information you may get from the README-2.4 included with this package.

   You may find an example kernel configuration for laptops in the 
   <a class="xref" href="ch14s03.html" title="3. Kernel Configuration for Laptops">Section 3, &#8220;Kernel Configuration for Laptops&#8221;</a>.

   At the moment there are two power management drivers in the linux kernel
   (AFAIK). They each have different userspace interfaces
   <code class="filename">/proc/apm/</code> and <code class="filename">/dev/apmctl/</code> and
   <code class="filename">/proc/acpi/</code> or something.

   For further information see the page of 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://john.fremlin.de/linux/offbutton/index.html" target="_top">John Fremlin</a>
   . He has also written a program named <span class="command"><strong>powermanager</strong></span>.

   With kernel 2.4 there is <acronym class="acronym">ACPI</acronym> available, see

   The SuSE
   <a class="ulink" href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/cvs/cvsbrowse.php/powersave/" target="_top">Powersave Daemon</a>
   provides battery, temperature, AC, and CPU
   frequency control and monitoring along with proper suspend to disk/RAM and
   standby support with shell hooks that are easy to extend. It supports APM
   and ACPI machines and can control a hard disk's advanced power and
   acoustic management settings. It is perfect for laptops and workstations
   that need to run quietly with low power consumption, or switch to full
   performance mode if needed. Self definable power schemes give full control
   over power control features and allow easy and automatic switching between
   performance or power saving settings for each hardware component.

   There is a new 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-hotplug-devel" target="_top">mailing list</a>
   for developers interested in any aspects of the Linux
   kernel hotplug ability and functionality. This would include (but is
   not restricted to) USB, PCMCIA, SCSI, Firewire, and probably PCI
   developers.
   There is an initial

   Kernel Support for Hot-Plugable Devices

</p><pre class="programlisting">
CONFIG_HOTPLUG
  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly. In many
  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers. Another
  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel. Get 
  <a class="ulink" href="http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net" target="_top">agent software</a>
  and install it. Then your kernel will automatically call out to a
  user mode "policy agent" (<span class="command"><strong>/sbin/hotplug</strong></span>) to
  load modules and set up software needed to use devices as
  you hotplug them.
