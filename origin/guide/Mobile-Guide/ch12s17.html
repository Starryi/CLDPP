   Most of the mice used in laptops are PS/2 mice (actually I
   don't know one with another mouse protocol). You may
   communicate with the PS/2 mouse through
   <code class="filename">/dev/psaux</code> or
   <code class="filename">/dev/psmouse</code>. If you use X Windows
   this device and the protocol has to be set in
   <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>. In earlier
   releases, sometimes the GPM mouse manager and X Windows had
   trouble sharing a mouse when enabled at the same time. But
   as far as I know this is no problem anymore for the latest
   versions. 
</p><p>
   Speaking of Emulate3Buttons, 100ms is usually better than
   the 50ms allowed in most default setups of
   <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</code> for XFree86 3.x:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Section "Pointer"
	...
	Emulate3Buttons
	Emulate3Timeout    100

   Or in <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</code> for XFree86 4.x:

   Usually a touchpad works with the PS/2 mouse device
   <code class="filename">/dev/psaux</code> and the PS/2 protocol (for GPM and X11,
   for X11 it seems also worth to check the GlidePointPS/2 protocol).

   The <span class="command"><strong>synclient</strong></span> command is provived with the driver
   sources (note it's not included in SuSE Linux, at least not until 9.3).
   The command  queries and modifies the Synaptics TouchPad driver
   parameters on the fly.
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
   Tipping with one, two or three fingers on the touchpad
   simultaneously results in pressing the left, middle and respectively the

</p></div><p>
   There is also another touchpad driver available. 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.compass.com/synaptics/" target="_top">The Synaptics Touchpad Linux Driver</a>
   - <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> 
   supports pointing devices used in notebooks by 
   Acer, Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Olivetti, Texas Instruments, Winbook, and others.
</p><p>
   Dell and Sony have started incorporating a touchpad, touchstick from
   ALPS.  They are in at least the Dell Latitude CPx and the Sony VAIO
   laptop lines. 
   
   Maintainer Bruce Kall writes: "<span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> does NOT support them at this
   time, but I am in the process of getting the API from ALPS and will be
   incorporating this in the next version of <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span>.
   The Dell's also incorporate the ALPS GlideStick in the middle of the
   keyboard (like the stick pointer in some of the IBM Thinkpads). I also
   intend to support the disabling of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">tapping</span>&#8221;</span> the GlideStick
   as well. Tapping of the touchpad/touchsticks drives me crazy, I'm not
   sure about you (causes the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">selection</span>&#8221;</span> of things on the
   screen when you don't want to)!"

</p><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> is a command-line utility to set options on
   Synaptics Touchpad and (now) ALPS Glidepad/ Stickpointers. Most people
   primarily use it to turn off the "tap mode" on laptop touchpads.
</p><p>
   How to use <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span>: <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> is
   currently supported as a command-line configuration tool. The PS/2 port
   does not currently support sharing. Therefore the
   <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> utility will not work while any other mouse
   driver is loaded (e.g. <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span>). This also means that you
   cannot use <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> while X Windows is running. The
   suggested use of <span class="command"><strong>tpconfig</strong></span> is to run it from a startup
   script before gpm is started.
</p><p>
   <a class="ulink" href="http://rsim.cs.uiuc.edu/~sachs/tp-scroll/" target="_top">IBM ThinkPad Scroll Daemon</a>
</p><p>
   Not all touchpads are being from Synaptics, e.g some Gateways incorporate an 
   EZ-Pad (Registered TM) and there might be other brands. The 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.synaptics.com/decaf/utilities/tprev.exe" target="_top">TPREV.EXE</a>
   utility will verify you have a Synaptics touchpad.
</p><p>
   The recent 
   <a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.prosa.it/pub/gpm/" target="_top">gpm</a>
   package (version &gt;=1.8, maybe earlier versions contain touchpad
   support, too) includes the above mentioned Synaptics touchpad device
   driver. This device driver has been developed by H. Davies
   &lt;hdavies_AT_ameritech.net&gt;. Instead of using the PS/2 compatibility
   mode of touchpad devices, you can now use native touchpad mode with some
   pretty impressive features. 
</p><p>
   In addition to translating finger motion into mouse motion and
   supporting the buttons, this support currently has several features
   (from the README):
</p><p>

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
   a "tap" on the TouchPad causes a left mouse click
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   a "tap" followed quickly by a finger motion causes a left button drag type action.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   a "tap" in one of the corners causes an action the default configuration
   is upper right causes middle mouse click and lower right causes right
   mouse click
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   more pressure on the touch pad speeds the motion of the cursor
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   a "tap" with a motion component (default &gt; 2mm) initiates a toss and
   catch sequence. This is terminated by a finger touch on the pad (the
   toss also ends after 1 sec since that is the idle timeout period for the
   touchpad).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   if the finger moves close to an edge then the mouse motion will be
   continued in that direction so that you don't need to pick up your
   finger and start moving again. This continued motion is pressure
   sensitive (more pressure is faster motion).
</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
   These features can be enabled/disabled and many of them have time and
   speed parameters which can be adjusted to the taste of the user.
</p><p>
   It seems <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span> is best known as a console biased tool.
   This is true, but you may use it as an X11 input device.
   <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span> is used as a repeater device. In this way you can
   use both the built-in synaptics touchpad with all the features and at
   the same time a serial mouse (with three buttons). This all works
   smoothly together. X11 reads the mouse events from a named pipe
   <code class="filename">/dev/gpmdata</code> in a protocol it understands, which in
   my case is <span class="emphasis"><em>Mouse-Systems-Compatible</em></span> (5bytes). Most
   3-button mice use the default protocol. So a simple reconfiguration in
   XF86Config is all that is required, after starting
   <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span> in an appropriate way, of course. 
</p><p>
   <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span> could be started on your laptop with the
   following arguments : <span class="command"><strong>/usr/bin/gpm -t synps2 -M -t ms -m
   /dev/ttyS0</strong></span> . Both touchpad and serial mouse work in console
   and X11 mode. You do have to create the named pipe
   <code class="filename">/dev/gpmdata</code> yourself.

</p><p>
   Tapping with two fingers simultaneously to simulate a middle mouse
   button works on Logitech touchpads used in a few machines.

   For better handling, e.g. with a 3 button mouse you may use an external
   mouse. This is usually a serial mouse or a PS/2 mouse, or in our days a USB
   mouse, appropriate to the port your laptop offers. Usually this is no
   problem. The only thing I currently don't know a solution for is the
   automagic detection of a newly plugged in mouse from X11. To get it work
   you have to restart your X server.

   Don't plug in the external mouse while powered up. If you have

   This part is taken from The Linux <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> Sub-System by
   Brad Hards.
</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idm2546"></a>17.9.3.1. USB Human Interface Device (HID) Configuration</h5></div></div></div><div class="sect5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="idm2548"></a>17.9.3.1.1. General HID Configuration</h6></div></div></div><p>
   There are two options for using a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse or a
   <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> keyboard - the standalone Boot Protocol way and
   the full featured HID driver way. The Boot Protocol way is generally
   inferior, and this document describes the full featured way. The Boot
   Protocol way may be appropriate for embedded systems and other systems
   with resource constraints and no real need for the full keyboard and
   mouse capabilities.
</p><p>
   It is important to remember that the HID driver handles those devices
   (or actually those interfaces on each device) that claim to comply with
   the Human Interface Device (HID) specification. However the HID
   specification doesn't say anything about what the HID driver should do
   with information received from a HID device, or where the information
   that is sent to a device comes from, since this is obviously dependent
   on what the device is supposed to be doing, and what the operating
   system is. Linux (at the operating system kernel level) supports four
   interfaces to a HID device - keyboard, mouse, joystick and a generic
   interface, known as the event interface.
</p></div><div class="sect5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="idm2554"></a>17.9.3.1.2. HID Mouse Configuration</h6></div></div></div><p>
   In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on
   <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> Human Interface Device (HID) support and Mouse
   Support Do not turn on <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> HIDBP Mouse support.
   Perform the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are
   installing as modules, you need to load the
   <code class="filename">input.o</code>, <code class="filename">hid.o</code> and
   <code class="filename">mousedev.o</code> modules.
</p><p>
   Plug in a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse and check that your mouse has
   been correctly sensed by the kernel. If you don't have a kernel message,
   look for the changes to <code class="filename">/proc/bus/usb/devices</code>.
</p><p>
   Since <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> supports multiple identical devices, you
   can have multiple mice plugged in. You can get each mouse seperately, or
   you can get them all mixed together. You almost always want the mixed
   version, and that is what will be used together. You need to set up a
   device node entry for the mixed mice. It is customary to create the
   entries for this device in the /dev/input/ directory.
</p><p>
Use the following commands: 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
mkdir /dev/input
mknod /dev/input/mice c 13 63
</pre><p>

</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
   If you are unsure whether you are configuring the right mouse device,
   use <span class="command"><strong>cat /dev/input/mice</strong></span> (or other appropriate
   devices names). In case you do this for the correct mouse, you should see some
   bizarre looking characters as you move the mouse or click any of the
   buttons. 

</p></div><p>
   If you want to use the mouse under X, you have various options. Which
   one you select is dependent on what version of XFree86 you are using and
   whether you are using only <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> for your mouse (or
   mice), or whether you want to use a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse and
   some other kind of pointer device.
</p><p>
   You need to edit the <code class="filename">XF86Config</code> file (usually
   <code class="filename">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</code> or
   <code class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>).
</p><p>
   If you are using XFree86 version 4.0 or later, add an
   InputDevice section that looks like the following: 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier  "USB Mice"
     Driver      "mouse"
     Option      "Protocol"   "IMPS/2"
     Option      "Device"     "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection
</pre><p>

   or, if you want to use a wheel mouse, something like this may be more useful: 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier  "USB Mice"
     Driver      "mouse"
     Option      "Protocol"   "IMPS/2"
     Option      "Device"     "/dev/input/mice"
     Option      "ZAxisMapping"   "4 5"
     Option      "Buttons"        "5"
EndSection
</pre><p>

</p><p>
   Consult the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xfree86.org/current/mouse.html" target="_top">current XFree86 documentation</a>
   for a detailed explanation and more examples.
</p><p>
   You also need to add an entry to each applicable ServerLayout Section.
   These are normally at the end of the configuration file. If you only have
   a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse (or <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mice), then
   replace the line with the "CorePointer" entry with the following line: 

</p><pre class="programlisting">

</p><p>
   If you want to use both a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mice) and some other kind of pointer device,
   then add (do not replace) the following line to the applicable
   ServerLayout sections:

   If you are using only a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mice) with XFree86 3.3, edit the Pointer
   section so that it looks like the following: 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Section "Pointer"
    Protocol    "IMPS/2"
    Device      "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection
</pre><p>

</p><p>
   If you are trying to use a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mice) in addition to another pointer type
   device with XFree86 3.3, then you need to use the XInput
   extensions. Keep the existing Pointer (or modify it as required for
   the other device if you are doing an initial installation), and add
   the following entry (anywhere sensible, ideally in the Input
   devices area): 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
Section "Xinput"
   SubSection "Mouse"
  DeviceName   "USB Mice"
  Protocol     "IMPS/2"
  Port         "/dev/input/mice"
  AlwaysCore
   EndSubSection
EndSection
</pre><p>

</p><p>
   Restart the X server. If you don't have any mouse support at this point,
   remember that Ctrl-Alt-F1 will get you a virtual terminal that you can
   use to kill the X server and start debugging from the error messages.
</p><p>
   If you want to use the mouse under gpm, run (or kill and restart if it
   is already running) gpm with the following options. <span class="command"><strong>gpm -m
   /dev/input/mice -t imps2</strong></span> (as superuser). You can make
   this the default if you edit the initialisation files. These are
   typically named something like rc.d and are in
   <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/</code> on RedHat distributions.
</p><p>
   If you have both a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mice) and some other kind of pointer device, you
   may wish to use gpm in repeater mode. If you have a PS/2 mouse on
   /dev/psaux and a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mouse (or <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym>
   mice) on /dev/input/mice, then the following <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span>
   command would probably be appropriate: <span class="command"><strong>gpm -m /dev/input/mice
   -t imps2 -M -m /dev/psaux -t ps2 -R imps2</strong></span>. Note that this will
   make the output appear on <code class="filename">/dev/gpmdata</code>, which is a
   FIFO and does not need to be created in advance. You can use this as the
   mouse "device" to non-X programs, and both mice will work together.

   The <span class="command"><strong>gpm</strong></span> contains a driver for the Twiddler 
   device at the serial port. For information about the Twiddler see

   PowerBooks have a trackpad and only one button, although you can plug in
   external multi-button <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> mice. The usual thing is to
   map a couple of keys on the keyboard to the middle and right mouse
   buttons; your Linux distribution should come with instructions on how to
   configure this (it's not specific to laptops, as all Apple mice are
   single-button).
</p><p>
   If you are using the <span class="command"><strong>Xpmac</strong></span> server, the default is
   option-1 and option-2, and you can change this by passing
   <span class="command"><strong>-middlekey &lt;keycode&gt;</strong></span> <span class="command"><strong>-rightkey
   &lt;keycode&gt;</strong></span> arguments to <span class="command"><strong>Xpmac</strong></span>, and
   <span class="command"><strong>-nooptionmouse</strong></span> if you don't want the option key to be
   needed. 
</p><p>
   If you are using XFree86, you pass
   <span class="command"><strong>adb_buttons=&lt;middlekey&gt;</strong></span>,<span class="command"><strong>&lt;rightkey&gt;</strong></span>
   kernel arguments (no option is required). I use
   <span class="command"><strong>adb_buttons=58,55</strong></span> to map the option and Apple/command
   keys (which are little-used in Linux); use e.g. <span class="command"><strong>xev</strong></span>
   to find out the keycode for a given key.
