   AFAIK there are currently three methods to connect a digital camera to a
   laptop: the infrared port (<span class="trademark">IrDA</span>®), serial port and maybe USB. There
   are also some auxiliary programs for conversion of pictures, etc.

   Sony (pretending using a standard) uses the msdos format to store
   images as JPEG files ; so the best way to have your OS recognizing
   them is to mount the raw device like a msdos filesystem; using mount
   directly doesn't work (don't know why) but an entry in the /etc/fstab
   file allows you to mount the device correctly. i.e.: 

</p><pre class="programlisting">
/dev/hde1    /mnt/camera    msdos     user,noauto,ro    0    0
</pre><p>

   Of course, <span class="command"><strong>newfs</strong></span> before <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span> works
   too, but there is nothing to see at all ;-) I think both
   <span class="command"><strong>noauto</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>ro</strong></span> are important flags;
   I tried without it and it didn't work. Somehow the mount I got seems
   buggy . And if <span class="command"><strong>ro</strong></span> is missing, the camera doesn't
   recognize back the memory stick and it needs to be msdos-formatted. 
</p><p>
   Appropriate to the camera documentation , both <acronym class="acronym">PCMCIA</acronym>
   and <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> port behave the same (for Mac and Windoze -
   i.e. you see a file system auto mounted) - I deduce for Linux it should
   be the same thing too, as long as the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> driver is
   installed. I think now that mounting <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> raw device
   the way I did with <acronym class="acronym">PCMCIA</acronym> should work, but I still
   couldn't find which device to use."

   <a class="ulink" href="http://digitalux.netpedia.net/" target="_top">OpenDiS (Open Digita Support)</a>
   is a library and utility program for cameras such as the Kodak
   DC-220, DC-260, DC-265, and DC-280, that run Flashpoint's Digita
   operating system. The library is a unix implementation of the
   Digita Host Interface Specification, intended for embedding
   Digita support in other products such as
   <span class="command"><strong>gPhoto</strong></span>. The utility is a simple command-line
   program for standalone downloading of photos from the cameras.
</p><p>
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gphoto.org/" target="_top">gPhoto</a>
   enables you to take a photo from any digital camera, load it
   onto your PC running a free operating system like GNU/Linux,
   print it, email it, put it on your web site, save it on your
   storage media in popular graphics formats or just view it on
   your monitor. <span class="command"><strong>gPhoto</strong></span> sports a new HTML
   engine that allows the creation of gallery themes (HTML
   templates with special tags) making publishing images to the
   world wide web a snap. A directory browse mode is implemented
   making it easy to create an HTML gallery from images already on
   your computer. Support for the Canon PowerShot A50, Kodak
   DC-240/280 USB, and Mustek MDC-800 digital cameras.

   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lightner.net/lightner/bruce/ppc_use.html" target="_top">photopc</a>
   is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate
   digital still cameras based on Fujitsu chipset and Siarra
   Imaging firmware. The program is known to work with Agfa,
   Epson and Olympus cameras. Should also work with Sanyo, but
   this is untested. The cameras typically come with software
   for Windows and for Mac, and no description of the protocol.
   With this tool, they are manageable from a
   <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> box. Bruce D. Lightner
   &lt;lightner_AT_metaflow.com&gt; has added support for
   Win32 and DOS platforms. Note that the program does not
   have any GUI, it is plain command-line even on Windows.
   For a GUI, check out the <span class="command"><strong>phototk</strong></span>
   program.

   <a class="ulink" href="http://kdc2tiff.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">kdc2tiff</a>
   is software to convert .kdc images from Kodak's DC120
   digital camera to .tiff or .jpg files. This software pays
   particular attention to aspect ratio, high quality
   scaling, contrast adjustment, gamma correction, and image
   rotation.

   is a command line tool that downloads images from a
   Ricoh RDC-2E digital camera. It is available as either
   a source tar ball or a RedHat 6.1 i386 RPM.
