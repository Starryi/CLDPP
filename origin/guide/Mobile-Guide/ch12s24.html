   First some definitions. There is a difference between <span class="emphasis"><em>docking
   station</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>port replicator</em></span>.
</p><p>
   I use the term <span class="emphasis"><em>docking station</em></span> for a box which
   contains slots to put some interface cards in, and space to put a
   harddisk, etc. in. This box can be permanently connected to a PC. A
   <span class="emphasis"><em>port replicator</em></span> is just a copy of the laptop ports
   which may be connected permanently to a PC.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm3065"></a>24.2. Other Solutions</h3></div></div></div><p>
   I don't use a docking station myself. They seem really expensive and I can't
   see any usefulness. Alright you have to deal with some more cables, but is
   it worth so much money? Docking stations are useful in an office
   environment when you have a permanent network connection, or need the
   docking station's expansion bus slots (e.g. for some excotic SCSI device).
</p><p>
   Also all docking stations I know are proprietary models, so if you
   change your laptop you have to change this device, too. I just found
   one exception a docking station which connects to your laptop via
   <span class="trademark">IrDA</span>® the IRDocking IR-660 by 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tekram.com/" target="_top">Tekram</a>
   . It supports these connectors: 10Base-T (RJ-45); PS/2 Keyboard; PS/2
   Mouse; 25-Pin Printer Port (LPT); IR Transceiver; Power (6 VDC). So it
   seems that a VGA port and a port to connect a desktop PC directly are
   missing. This device should work with Linux/<span class="trademark">IrDA</span>®, though I couldn't check it out.
</p><p>
   I would prefer to buy a PC instead and connect it via
   <span class="emphasis"><em>network</em></span> to the laptop.
</p><p>
   Or use an external display, which usually works well as described above,
   and an external keyboard and mouse. If your laptop supports an extra
   PS/2 port you may use a cheap solution a <span class="emphasis"><em>Y-cable</em></span>,
   which connects the PS/2 port to an external keyboard and an external
   monitor. Note: Your laptop probably has support for the <span class="emphasis"><em>Y-cable</em></span>
   feature, e.g. the COMPAQ Armada 1592DT.

   AFAIK there are <span class="emphasis"><em>four solutions</em></span> to connect a laptop
   to a docking station:
</p><p>

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
   SCSI port (very seldom)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
parallel port
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
(proprietary) docking port (common)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
USB (often offered by third party manufacturers)
</p></li></ol></div><p>

</p><p>
   From Martin J. Evans
   
   "The main problem with docking stations is getting the operating
   system to detect you are docked. Fortunately, 
   you can examine the devices available in <code class="filename">/proc</code>
   and thus detect a docked state. With
   this in mind a few simple scripts is all you need to get your machine
   configured correctly in a docked state.
</p><p>
   You may want to build support for the docking station hardware as
   modules instead of putting it directly into the kernel. This will save
   space in your kernel but your choice probably largely depends on how
   often you are docked.
</p><p>
   1) Supporting <span class="emphasis"><em>additional disks</em></span> on the docking
   station SCSI card
</p><p>
   To my mind the best way of doing this is to:
</p><p>

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
   Either build support for the SCSI card into the kernel or build it as a module.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Put the mount points into <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> but use the
   "noauto" flag to prevent them from being mounted automatically with the
   <span class="command"><strong>mount -a</strong></span> flag. In this way, when you are docked you
   can explicitly mount the partitions off any disk connected to the
   docking station SCSI card.
</p></li></ol></div><p>

</p><p>
   2) Supporting <span class="emphasis"><em>additional network adaptors</em></span> in the docking station
</p><p>
   You can use a similar method to that outlined above for the graphics
   card. Check the <code class="filename">/proc</code> filesystem in your rc scripts
   to see if you are docked and then set up your network connections
   appropriately. "
</p><p>
   Once you determine this information, you may use a script, similar to
   the following example, to configure the connection to your docking
   station at startup. The script is provided by Friedhelm Kueck:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="programlisting">

I have used a Typhoon USB 2.0 7in1 Docking Station made by 
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.anubisline.com/" target="_top">Anubis</a>
P/N 83057 to check the Linux compatibility of such devices. Actually
this device should be named port replicator, because it does not have
any extension slots. 
This device doesn't have a VGA port to connect to an external
display. Only a few USB docking stations have this feature. It would
be nice to get a report whether a VGA port works or not.
Tested with laptop COMPAQ M700 (USB 1.1) and custom made kernel 2.6.1.
Note the port replicator didn't work with
an Apple PowerBook G4.

How does its different ports work with Linux:
