Scott Mueller: Upgrading and Repairing Laptops, 2003
</p><p>

From the publisher: 
"Scott Mueller goes where no computer book author has gone before right past all 
the warranty stickers, the hidden screws, and the fear factor to produce a 
real owner's manual that every laptop owner should have on his desk. 
This book shows the upgrades users can perform, the ones that are 
better left to the manufacturer, and how to use add-on peripherals 
to make the most of a laptop. The CD contains one-of-a-kind 
video showing just what's inside a portable PC."

Chris Hurley, Michael Puchol, Russ Rogers, Frank Thornton: WarDriving - Drive, Detect, Defend, A Guide to Wireless Security, 2004
</p><p>

From the Publisher: 
"Wardriving has brought some of the top people in the wireless industry
together to put together a truly informative book on what wardriving is
and the tools that should be part of any IT department's arsenal that
either has wireless or is looking to deploy it." -John Kleinschmidt,
Michiganwireless.org Founder

The practice of WarDriving is a unique combination of hobby, sociological
research, and security assessment. The act of driving or walking through
urban areas with a wireless-equipped laptop to map both protected and
un-protected wireless networks has sparked intense debate amongst
lawmakers, security professionals, and the telecommunications industry.
This first ever book on WarDriving is written from the inside perspective
of those who have created the tools that make WarDriving possible and
those who gather, analyze, and maintain data on all secured and open
wireless access points in very major, metropolitan area worldwide. These
insiders also provide the information to secure your wireless network
before it is exploited by criminal hackers.

Wireless networks have become a way of life in the past two years. As more
wireless networks are deployed the need to secure them increases. This book
educates users of wireless networks as well as those who run the networks
about the insecurities associated with wireless networking. This effort is
called WarDriving. In order to successfully WarDrive there are hardware and
software tool required. This book covers those tools, along with cost
estimates and recommendations. Since there are hundreds of possible
configurations that can be used for WarDriving, some of the most popular are
presented to help readers decide what to buy for their own WarDriving setup.

Many of the tools that a WarDriver uses are the same tools that could be used
by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a wireless network. Since this
is not the goal of a WarDriver, the methodology that users can use to
ethically WarDrive is presented. In addition, complete coverage of WarDriving
applications, such as NetStumbler, MiniStumbler; and Kismet, are covered."

Isidor Buchmann: Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers, 2001
</p><p>
From the Publisher: 
"Batteries in a Portable World fills a definite need for practical
information about rechargeable batteries. Quite often, performance
specifications for batteries and chargers are based on ideal
conditions. Manufacturers carry out battery tests on brand new
equipment and in a protected environment, removed from the stress of
daily use. In Batteries in a Portable World, Mr. Buchmann observes the
battery in everyday life in the hands of the common user. By reading
Batteries in a Portable World, you will acquire a better understanding
of the strengths and limitations of the battery. You will learn how to
prolong battery life; become familiar with recommended maintenance
methods and discover ways to restore a weak battery, if such a method
is available for that battery type. Knowing how to take care of your
batteries prolongs service life, improves reliability of portable
equipment and saves money. Best of all, well-performing batteries need
replacement less often, reducing the environmental concern of battery
disposal."
