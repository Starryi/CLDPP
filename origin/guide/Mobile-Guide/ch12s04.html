   Intels Centrino(TM) technology consists of three parts: a Pentium M processor, 
   a chipset, and a wireless module. Let's see
   how these parts are supported under Linux so far.
</p><p>
   Here you may find current information about
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/centrino.html" target="_top">Linux on Centrino laptops and notebooks</a>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1819"></a>4.1. CPU: Pentium-M</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Robert Freund has written a concise 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://rffr.de/acpi" target="_top">HOWTO</a>
   about controlling ACPI Centrino(TM) features via
   software in Linux. He describes how to control CPU frequency and other
   energy saving modes, as well as how to get information about the battery state.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm1823"></a>4.2. Chipset: 855/915</h3></div></div></div><p>
   The Intel 855/915 chipset families are designed to deliver better
   performance at lower power. The chipsets are available as discrete memory
   controller hub (e.g. Intel 855PM).  Or as an integrated graphics and
   memory controller hub (e.g. Intel 855GM). Intel provides the Extreme
   Graphics driver for Linux, which includes AGP GART and DRM kernel modules
   as a binary files. I have no experience with this drivers, because
   the chipsets work with XFree86/X.org drivers, too.
   The Pentium-M CPU may come accompanied with other
   graphics chipsets too, e.g. from ATI, nVIDIA or Trident.

   There are different solutions to get these cards running with Linux:
   drivers from Intel, NDIS wrapper and Linuxant driverloader (commercial).
</p><p>
   <a class="ulink" href="http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ipw2100</a>,
   Intel's Open Source driver with included firmware, for the first
   Centrino generation (incl. WEP and WPA together with HostAP).
   
   For the second generation of Intel's miniPCI modules: PRO/Wireless
   2200BG (802.11g/802.11i), the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ipw2200</a>
   project provides a driver.
   
   Third generation PRO/Wireless 2915ABG (IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g und
   802.11a) miniPCI cards will be supported by the
   <a class="ulink" href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ipw2200</a>
   project, too.
</p><p>
   Intel didn't provide drivers, when the begun to sell their Centrino
   technology. During this time there have been other solutions:

   Some vendors refuse to release technical specifications or even a binary Linux driver
   for their WLAN cards. NDIS wrapper tries to solve this by making a kernel
   module that can load NDIS (Microsoft-Windows Network Driver Interface
   Specification) drivers. Currently there are two implementations available.
   The commercial
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/" target="_top">Linuxant Driverloader</a>
   supports a broad range of chipsets including Intel's PRO/Wireless 2100 LAN
   Mini-PCI Adapter. There is also 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ndiswrapper</a>
   an Open Source solution by Pontus Fuchs.
</p><p>
   As another workaround was the usage of a Linux-supported
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/minipci_linux.html" target="_top">miniPCI WLAN card</a>.
   These cards are difficult to get, but some desktop WLAN PCI cards contain miniPCI cards. Often it is a tedious task to
   build them into a laptop. Kernel maintainer Theodore Tytso has written a 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.thunk.org/tytso/linux/t40.html" target="_top">manual</a> about achieving this task. You may also
   use a wireless PCMCIA or CF card
   instead. This solution may provide more flexibility, because you may use a PCMCIA or
   CF card in different devices and choose the Linux driver of your choice. You may also extend the wireless range by
   adding antennas to some cards. For Linux compatibility there is the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/pcmcia_linux.html" target="_top">TuxMobil PCMCIA/CF Card Survey</a>.
   In the future, manufacturers will probably offer alternative miniPCI solutions. DELL is already doing so for their
   Latitude D series.

   Though Linux support is not yet complete, some features of the Centrino(TM) technology already make it worthwhile to
   take into account when buying your next laptop. Though the new CPUs are named so similarly to existing ones that some
   people mix them up, they are completely different inside. Compared to the Pentium-4 Mobile CPU, the Pentium-M will
   allow a smaller form factor for laptops, making them more portable and lighter. Because of their higher clockspeed,
   the Pentium-4 CPUs have produced too much heat to build them into slimline notebook cases. Therefore, very flat
   notebooks have only been available from Apple or with a Pentium III Mobile CPU. Also, the battery power the Pentium-M
   consumes for a given level of performance will decrease, but I do not have a benchmark about how much the savings
   actually are yet. PENN Computing offers a nice 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.upenn.edu/computing/provider/docs/centrinoprovider.html" target="_top">comparison of Pentium-M and Pentium-4 Mobile</a>.
   Note: The character M in Pentium-M suggests "mobile". Therefore some people mix
   this kind of CPU with the mobile versions of the Pentium-III/Pentium-4 CPU.
</p><p>
   Laptops based on the Centrino(TM) features are already
   very popular in the Linux community.
