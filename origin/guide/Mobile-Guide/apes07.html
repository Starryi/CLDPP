   Here are some comments and thoughts by Nat Makarevitch 
   
   about a possible approach which may
   reduce the disk activity under Linux (sparing energy, especially with
   noflushd) the file Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt of the Linux sourcetree
   documents some useful features, esp. in the 
   <code class="filename">/proc/sys/vm</code> section.

   Under Linux 2.2 I used:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
echo "100 5000 8 256 500 60000 60000 1884 2" &gt; /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
</pre><p>

   especially under Linux 2.4 which uses its spare time to 'pre-save' the
   less-used memory pages into the swap, increasing the disk activity
   
   I tried to figure the more adequate parameters (Linux 2.4.9, 192 MB RAM,
   Toshiba 3480 laptop)
   
   beware: some of those parameters may be dangerous or useless (I have not
   gathered serious data about the practical efficiency).  moreover do not
   forget that delaying disk writes of data is intrinsically dangerous

</p><pre class="programlisting">
echo 99 512 32 512 0 300000 60 0 0 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
# is '60' the max value for age_super?
echo 1 1 96 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/buffermem

   Some more words about
   disks spin down with <span class="command"><strong>noflushd</strong></span> or
   <span class="command"><strong>hdparm</strong></span> utilities. The objective
   is to reduce hard disk usage to minimum, because on most laptops it
   is the primary source of noise and energy consumption. The "noflushd" daemon is a
   replacement of "update" which makes buffer updates on disk only when
   some other data is being read from the disk (the behavior of "update"
   is to flush buffers every 5 seconds, and it usually generates
   constant disk activity, so that the disk never becomes idle).
   "noflushd" also sets the disk spindown time and automatically calls
   "sync" before spindown.  The syntax is something like "noflushd -n 5
   /dev/hda". Using "noflushd" may cause loss of data if some files were
   edited while the disk was parked and not sync'ed, e.g. if the power
   was suddenly lost.
</p><p>
   The <span class="command"><strong>hdparm</strong></span> utility can set the sleep time too, and also tune the
   IDE disk parameters for better performance. Make sure that the
   kernel IDE parameter "Use DMA by default when available" (section
   "Block devices") is enabled.
</p><p>
   However, it is not enough to enable <span class="command"><strong>noflushd</strong></span>
   or IDE disk sleep time to make the disk 
   effectively silent, because the system in most
   default installations is running many cron jobs, writes to log files,
   uses swap and so on. This activity is not always desirable,
   especially if the computer is standalone (not on network) and is used
   mostly by one user.  Here are some recommendations.
</p><p>
   First, the cron daemon and friends (anacron, atd, logrotate,
   sendmail / exim / ...) could be removed from the system if the
   services they run (such as, cleaning /tmp directories and logs,
   checking email etc.) are not needed.
</p><p>
   Secondly, the syslogd configuration file
   <code class="filename">/etc/syslog.conf</code> should
   be modified to reduce the number of log files and messages
   logged, and also to have "-" signs before every file name (which
   means that the system will not have to sync the disk every time a
   message is logged).
</p><p>
   Also, it is advisable to add "mark:none;" to the "syslog" strings,
   so that the "strich strich strich MARK strich strich strich"
   messages do not get written to the log files every half an hour.
   Typical Linux installations today have too many log files for the
   home user.
</p><p>
   Finally, the disk may not go to sleep when a lot of swap space is
   in use. Type "free" and see how much swap is being used and how
   much free RAM is available. If you think there is enough free RAM
   to work without swap, or if there is a lot of swap used AND also
   a lot of free RAM, consider freeing the swap space ("su; swapoff
   -a; swapon -a") or switching the swap space off altogether ("su;
   swapoff -a"). Working without swap should be fine on systems with
   64MB or more of RAM.  (Working without swap will reduce the
   available memory, of course, and some software crashes without
   warning when it runs out of memory. But, adding swap will not
   prevent the crash resulting from some runaway memory consumuing
   software, it will only delay it, and it will make the system swap
   a lot before it happens.)
</p><p>
   With these changes in the system, one could get the laptop to
   work for extended periods of time with its hard disk switched
   off.
</p><p>
   The kernel can be configured with "Yes" to "APM Support" and
   "Enable console blanking using APM" (section "General setup").
   Then the LCD screen lamp will shut off in console mode (so not
   just the screen goes black, but also the lamp). In X mode, the
   same effect can be obtained with "xset +dpms" (enable DPMS
   function) and "xset s blank" (enable screen blanking). One can
   add these commands to the X window session or window manager
   initialization scripts.
</p><p>
   The computer's BIOS energy savings options (hard disk sleep
   time, video blanking time and so on) are probably not
   useful and in some cases may even cause crashes.  Therefore
   they could be disabled in the laptop's BIOS.
