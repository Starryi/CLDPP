   Besides its Linux features, there often are some <span class="emphasis"><em>main
   features</em></span> which have to be considered when buying a laptop.
   For <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux features</em></span> please see
   <a class="xref" href="pt05.html" title="Part V. Mobile Hardware in Detail">Part V, &#8220;Mobile Hardware in Detail&#8221;</a> Hardware In Detail
   below.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm252"></a>4.1. Weight</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Don't underestimate the weight of a laptop. This weight is mainly
   influenced by:
</p><p>

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
   screen size
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   battery type
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   internal components, such as CD drive, floppy drive
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   power supply
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   material used for the case, usually they are either from plastics or from magnesium.
</p></li></ol></div><p>

</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm267"></a>4.2. Display</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Recent laptops come with 
   <span class="emphasis"><em>active</em></span> matrix (TFT) displays. 
   Laptops with <span class="emphasis"><em>passive</em></span> matrix (DSTN) are no longer manufactured.
   Active matrix
   displays have better color and contrast, but usually cost
   more and use more power. Also consider the screen size.
   Laptops may be purchased with screens up to 17". A bigger
   screen weighs more, costs more, and is harder to carry,
   but is good for a portable desktop replacement.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm272"></a>4.3. Batteries</h3></div></div></div><p>
   The available battery types are <span class="emphasis"><em>Lithium Ion
   (LiIon)</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Nickel Metal Hydride (
   NiMH)</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Nickel Cadmium
   (NiCd)</em></span>. Though almost all current laptops come
   with LiIon batteries.
</p><p>
   LiIon batteries are the most expensive ones but a lot lighter
   than NiCd for the same energy content, and have minimal - but
   present - memory effects. NiMH is better than NiCd, but still
   rather heavy and does suffer some (although less than NiCd)
   memory effects.
</p><p>
   Unfortunately most laptops come with a proprietary battery
   size. So they are not interchangeable between different
   models. 



</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm280"></a>4.4. CPU</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm282"></a>4.4.1. Supported CPU Families</h4></div></div></div><p>
   For details about systems which are supported by the Linux Kernel, see the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/" target="_top">The linux-kernel mailing list FAQ</a>. 

</p><p>

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
   i286: 
   Linux doesn't support this CPU family yet. But there are some efforts at 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://elks.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ELKS</a>. 
   If you like, you may use 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html" target="_top">Minix</a>, which
   is also a free Unix operating system. Minix supports 8088 to 286 CPUs
   with as little as 640K memory. Actually there are some 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/286_mobile.html" target="_top">laptops with ELKS and MINIX</a> around.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   i386: This covers PCs based on Intel-compatible processors, including
   Intel's 386, 486, Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium II, and compatible
   processors by AMD, Cyrix and others. Most of the currently available
   laptops use Intel compatible CPUs and have quite good Linux support.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   m68k: This covers Amigas and Ataris having a Motorola 680x0 processor
   for x&gt;=2; with MMU. And the early Apple/Macintosh computers.
</p><p>
   There was a long series of Apple PowerBooks and other laptops based on
   the m68k chip. Macintosh Portable (an ugly 16-pound first attempt);
   PowerBook 100, 140, 170, 145, 160, 180c, 165c, 520c, 540c, 550c, 190;
   Duo 210, 230, 250, 270c, 280. The PowerBook Duos were available at the
   same time as the PowerBooks, they were a sort of subnotebook, but were
   designed so that you could plug them into a base station (a DuoDock)
   with more RAM, peripherals, etcetera, so that they could also act as a
   desktop computer. The first PowerPC PowerBooks were the ill-starred
   PowerBook 5300 (after the 190) and the Duo 2300c.
</p><p>
   For a complete list of all Macintosh computers ever made, with specifications, see 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apple-history.com/" target="_top">Apple-History</a>
   .
   For Linux installation reports see 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/apple.html" target="_top">Linux Laptop and Notebook Survey: Apple</a>.

   The proper place to 
   go for information on running Linux on m68k Macintoshes is 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/" target="_top">linux-m68k</a>.
</p><p>
   "Much like laptops of the Intel/Linux world, Mac laptops have generally
   different setups that can be very hard to figure out.  Also, because of
   a general lack of machines to test, we are only aware of boots on the
   Powerbook 145, Powerbook 150, Powerbook 170, Powerbook 180, and
   Powerbook 190. Even if it boots, we currently have no support for
   Powerbook-style ADB, the <acronym class="acronym">APM</acronym> support, or just about
   anything else on them. This means the only way to log in is with a
   terminal hooked up to the serial interface, this has been tested on the
   170."
</p><p>
   "Several Powerbooks have internal IDE which is supported.
   <acronym class="acronym">PCMCIA</acronym> drivers will be forthcoming if someone can
   supply the necessary hardware information to write a driver. As always,
   an FPU is needed also. Many of the later models have the 68LC040
   processor without FPU, and many of these processors are broken with
   respect to the FPU trap mechanism so they can't run regular Linux
   binaries even with FPU emulation. Current status on Powerbooks 140, 160,
   165, 165c, 180c, 190, 520 and Duos 210, 230, 250, 270c, 280, and 280c is
   unknown."
</p><p>
   Also there are two Atari laptops, for which I don't have enough information. 
   The following quotations are from the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://capybara.sk-pttsc.lj.edus.si/yescrew/eng/atari.htm" target="_top">Atari Gallery</a>.
</p><p>
   "The <span class="emphasis"><em>STacy</em></span> was released shortly after the
   <span class="emphasis"><em>Mega ST</em></span> to provide a portable means of Atari
   computing. STacy computers were shipped with TOS v1.04.
</p><p>
   Designed to replace the <span class="emphasis"><em>STacy</em></span> as the defacto
   portable ST computer, the <span class="emphasis"><em>ST Book</em></span> brought the basic
   computing power of an ST to a lightweight notebook computer. This
   machine was only released in Europe and Atari only shipped a very small
   quantity. The ST Book was shipped with TOS v2.06."
</p><p>
   From Stok, Leon &lt;stok_AT_YIS.NL&gt;: The STacey and the ST Book, both
   can't run Linux since they are only shipped with an 68000 CPU, which
   doesnt have a MMU unit. 
</p><p>
   As far as I know Amiga has never produced laptops. One company
   manufactured kits to convert desktop Amigas to portables. These used
   regular Amiga motherboards so any Linux setup that supports the regular
   Amiga setups will support these.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   Alpha, Sparc, Sparc64 architectures: 
   These are currently under construction. As far as I know there are only the 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tadpole.com/" target="_top">Tadpole</a>
   SPARC and ALPHA laptops, and some other ALPHA laptops available. 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.naturetech.com.tw/" target="_top">NatureTech</a> 
   offers also SPARC CPUs in laptops. The TuxMobil survey of
   <a class="ulink" href="http://tuxmobil.org/mobile_solaris.html" target="_top">Solaris on laptops and notebooks</a>
   may also be helpful.

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
   StrongARM: 
   a very low-power CPU found in 
   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rebel.com/" target="_top">Rebel.com's</a>
   popular NetWinder (some kind of mobile computer, too),
   and actively supported in the Debian project, it is also in several 
   WinCE machines, such as HP's Jornadas. Only the lack of tech specs
   prevents Linux from being ported to these tiny, long-battery-life 
   machines. A full-scale StrongARM-based laptop would make a superb 
   Linux platform.

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm336"></a>4.4.2. Miscellaneous</h4></div></div></div><p>
   At higher speed, a CPU consumes more power and generates more heat.
   Therefore, in many laptops a special low-power CPU is used.
   Usually, this special CPU doesn't use as much power as a similar
   processor used in a desktop. These special CPUs are also more expensive.
   As a side effect you may find that laptops with a desktop CPU often have
   a quite noisy fan.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm339"></a>4.5. Number of Spindles</h3></div></div></div><p>
Laptops and notebooks are often described by the number of spindles.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
one spindle: harddisk. Usually sub-notebooks, often provided with
an external optical drive (CD/DVD).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
two spindles: harddisk, optical drive (CD/DVD).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
three spindles: harddisk, optical drive (CD/DVD), floppy drive. These laptops
are often used as desktop PC replacement.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm349"></a>4.6. Cooling</h3></div></div></div><p>
   An enormously important issue.  Anything based on PPC or Pentium will
   generate enormous amounts of heat which must be dissipated. Generally,
   this means either a fan, or a heat sink the size of the case. If it's a
   fan, the air path shouldn't get blocked, or it will overheat
   and burn out. This means machines with a fan mounted in the bottom are a
   big, big mistake: you can't use them on a soft surface.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm352"></a>4.7. Keyboard Quality</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Though you might use your desktop computer to do longer writings, a good
   keyboard can save you some head- and fingeraches. Look especially
   for the location of special keys like: <span class="command"><strong>&lt;ESC&gt;</strong></span>,
   <span class="command"><strong>&lt;TAB&gt;</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>&lt;Pos1&gt;</strong></span>,
   <span class="command"><strong>&lt;End&gt;</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>&lt;PageDown&gt;</strong></span>,
   <span class="command"><strong>&lt;PageUp&gt;</strong></span> and the cursor keys.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm361"></a>4.8. Price</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Laptops are quite expensive if you compare them with desktops (though
   maybe not if compared with <acronym class="acronym">LCD</acronym>, 
   <span class="trademark">IrDA</span>®, <acronym class="acronym">PCMCIA</acronym>
   capabilities). So you may decide between a brand or no-name product.
   Though I would like to encourage you to take a
   <span class="emphasis"><em>no-name</em></span> product, there are some caveats. I have
   experienced that laptops break often, so you are better off, when you
   have an after-sales warranty, which is usually only offered with brand
   products. Or you may decide to take a <span class="emphasis"><em>second hand</em></span>
   machine. When I tried this, I discovered that the laptop market is
   changing quite often.  A new generation is released approximately every
   three months (compared by CPU speed, harddisk capacity, screen size
   etc.). So laptops become old very quick. But this scheme often isn't
   followed by the prices for second hand laptops. They seem too expensive
   to me. Anyway if you plan on purchasing a second hand machine, review my
   recommendations on checking the machine.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm369"></a>4.9. Power Supply</h3></div></div></div><p>
   If you travel abroad pay attention to the voltage levels which are
   supported by the power supply. Also the power supply is usually one of the
   heavier parts of a laptop. Another caveat is the power plug, which often
   is different from country to country.
