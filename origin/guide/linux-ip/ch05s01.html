      Network address translation (NAT) is a technique of transparently mapping
      an IP address or range to another IP address or range.  Any routing
      device situated between two endpoints can perform this transformation of
      the packet.  Network designers must however take one key element under
      consideration when laying out a network with NAT in mind.  The router(s)
      performing NAT must have an opportunity to rewrite the packet upon entry
      to the network and upon exit from the network
      <a href="#ftn.idm2474" class="footnote" name="idm2474"><sup class="footnote">[30]</sup></a>.
    </p><p>
      Because network address translation manipulates the addressing of a
      packet, the NAT transformation becomes a passive but
      critical part of the conversation between hosts exchanging packets.
      NAT is by necessity transparent to the application layer endpoints
      and operates on any type of IP packet.  There are some application and
      even network layer protocols which will break as a result of this
      rewriting.  Consult
      <a class="xref" href="ch05s02.html" title="2. Application Layer Protocols with Embedded Network Information">Section 2, &#8220;Application Layer Protocols with Embedded Network Information&#8221;</a> for a discussion of these cases.

      Here are a few common reasons to consider NAT along with potential
      NAT solution candidates shown in parentheses.

          Publicly accessible services need to be provided on registered
          Internet IPs which change or might change.  NAT allows the
          separation of internal IP addressing schemes from the public IP
          space, easing the burden of changing internal addressing
          or external IPs.

          The network numbering scheme is changing.  Clever use of NAT

          Two networks share the same IP addressing space and need to

          NAT network spaces with different numbering schemes would
          allow each network to retain the addressing scheme while accessing

      These are the commonest reasons to consider and implement NAT.  Other
      niche applications of NAT, notably as part of load balancing systems,
      exist although this chapter will concentrate on the use of NAT 
      to hide, isolate or renumber networks.  It will also cover
      inbound connections,
      leaving the discussion of many-to-one NAT, SNAT and masquerading for
      <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Masquerading and Source Network Address Translation">Chapter 6, <i>Masquerading and Source Network Address Translation</i></a>.
    </p><p>
      One motivator for deploying NAT in a network is the benefit of
      virtualizing the network.  By isolating services provided in one network
      from changes in other networks, the effects of such changes can be
      minimized.  The disadvantage of
      virtualizing the network in this way is the increased reliance on the
      NAT device.
    </p><p>
      Providing inbound services via NAT can be accomplished in several
      different ways.  Two common techniques are to use
      <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> NAT and netfilter DNAT.
      Less common (and possibly less desirable) one can use port redirection
      tools.  Depending on which tool is employed,
      different characteristics of a packet can trigger the address
      transformation.
    </p><p>
      The simplest form of NAT under linux is 
      <a class="link" href="ch05s03.html" title="3. Stateless NAT with iproute2"><span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> NAT</a>.
      This type of NAT requires two matching commands, one to cause the kernel
      to rewrite the inbound packets (<strong class="userinput"><code>ip route add nat $NATIP
      via $REAL</code></strong>)
      and one to rewrite the outbound packets (<strong class="userinput"><code>ip rule add from
      $REAL nat $NATIP</code></strong>).  The router configured in this fashion will
      retain no state for connections.  It will simply transform any packets
      passing through.  By contrast, netfilter is capable of retaining state
      on connections passing through the router and selecting packets more
      granularly than is possible with only <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> tools.
    </p><p>
      Before the advent of the netfilter engine in the linux kernel, there
      were several tools available to administer NAT, DNAT and PAT.
      These tools were not included in many distributions and weren't
      adopted broadly in the community.  Although you may find references to
      <span class="command"><strong>ipmasqadm</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>ipnatadm</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>ipportfw</strong></span> across the Internet in older documentation,
      these tools have been superseded in functionality and widespread
      deployment by the netfilter engine and its userspace partner,
      <span class="command"><strong>iptables</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
      The netfilter engine provides a more flexible
      language for selection of packets to be transformed than that provided
      by the <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> suite and kernel routing functionality.
      Additionally, any
      NAT services provided by the netfilter engine come with the labor-saving
      and resource-consuming connection tracking mechanism.
      <a class="link" href="ch05s05.html" title="5. Destination NAT with netfilter (DNAT)">DNAT</a> translates the address on an
      inbound packet and creates an entry in the connection tracking state
      table.  For even modest machines, the connection tracking resource
      consumption should not be problematic.
    </p><p>
      Netfilter DNAT allows the user to select packets based on
      characteristics such as destination port.  This blurs the distinction
      between network address translation and port address translation.
      NAT always transforms the layer 3 contents of a packet.  Port
      redirection operates at layer 4.  From a practical perspective, there is
      little difference between a port redirection and a netfilter DNAT which
      has selected a single port.  The manner in which the packet and contents
      are retransmitted, however, is tremendously different.
    </p><p>
      One other less common technique for furnishing inbound services is
      the use of
      <a class="link" href="ch05s06.html" title="6. Port Address Translation (PAT) from Userspace">port redirection</a>.  Although
      there are higher layer tools which can perform transparent application
      layer proxying (e.g.
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" target="_top">Squid</a>), these are
      outside the scope of this documentation.
    </p><p>
      There are a number of IP addresses involved in any NAT transformations
      or connection states.  The following list identifies these names and the
      convention used to describe each IP address.  Beware that the prevalance
      of NAT to publish services on the Internet via public IP addresses has
      lead to the server/client lingo common in discussions of NAT.
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">server NAT IP, </span><span class="term">NAT IP</span></dt><dd><p>
            The IP address to which packets are addressed.  This is the
            address on the packet before the device performing NAT
            manipulates it.
            This is frequently also described as the public IP, although
            any given application of NAT knows no distinction between public
            and private address ranges.

            The IP address after the NAT device has performed its

            public and private address ranges.

            The source address of the initial packet.  The client IP in a NAT
            transformation does not change; this IP is the source IP address
            on any inbound packets both before and after the translation.  It
            is also the destination address on the outbound packet.
          </p></dd></dl></div><p>
      The above terms will be used below and in general discussions of NAT.
