      Proxy ARP is a technique for splitting an IP network into two
      separate segments.  Hosts on one segment can only reach hosts in the
      other segment through the router performing proxy ARP.  If a router sits
      between two parts of an IP network and is not running bridging software,
      then routes to hosts in each segment and proxy ARP are required
      on the router to allow each half of the
      network to communicate with the other half.
    </p><p>
      Occasionally, this technique is incorrectly called proxy ARP bridging.
      An Ethernet bridge operates on frames and a router operates on packets.
      The proxy ARP router should have routes to all hosts on both segments.
      Once the router can reach all locally connected destinations via the
      correct interfaces, you can begin to configure the proxy ARP
      functionality.
    </p><p>
      Although proxy ARP complicates a network, a great advantage of proxy ARP
      technique is the greater control over IP connections between hosts.
    </p><p>
      There are two primary proxy ARP techniques.  With the 2.4 kernel, it is
      possible to use the sysctl
      <code class="filename">net/ipv4/conf/all/proxy_arp</code> to perform proxy ARP.
      Alternatively, manual population of the ARP table reaches the same end.
    </p><p>
      The key part of the correct functioning of proxy ARP in a network is
      that the host breaking a network into two parts has correct routes for
      all destinations in both halves of the network.  If the host which has
      interfaces in both networks does not have an accurate routing table, IP
      packets will get dropped on the routing device.
    </p><p>
      One common method of breaking a network in two involves making a very
      small stub subnet at one end or the other of the IP range.  This small
      subnet (maybe as small as a /30 network, with two usable IPs) makes an
      excellent sequestered location for a host which requires more
      protection or even, a generally untrusted host which shouldn't have
      complete access to the Ethernet to which the other machines connect.
    </p><p>
      For a practical example of this, see the relationship between the
      <code class="systemitem">service-router</code>, <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> and <code class="systemitem">isolde</code> in the
      <a class="link" href="apas01.html" title="1. Example Network Map and General Notes">network map</a>.  <code class="systemitem">isolde</code> and
      <code class="systemitem">service-router</code> share the same IP network, 192.168.100.0/24.  If either
      has a packet for the other, it will generate an ARP request which should
      be answered by <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>.  Naturally, <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> has its routes
      configured in such a way that both hosts are reachable from it.  Thus,
      the packet will successfully pass through <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>.
    </p><p>
      Let's examine what the sequence of events is by which the packet will
      reach <code class="systemitem">service-router</code> from <code class="systemitem">isolde</code>.  In this example, <code class="systemitem">isolde</code> will
      send an echo request packet to <code class="systemitem">service-router</code>.  Please also refer to
      <a class="xref" href="apbs01.html" title="1. arp">Section 1, &#8220;<span class="command"><strong>arp</strong></span>&#8221;</a> for examples and command lines to create

      Where possible, a simplified network is easier to maintain, but
      occasionally, this sort of trickery is necessary.  This is an excellent
      way to insert a firewall into the middle of a network.  The firewall,
      naturally, has to have its routes set properly, and proxy ARP entries
      will be required for routers.

      Now, here's a short script and configuration file which can be run as a
      SysVInit style script.  This script provides a great deal of control
      over the ARP table directly so may be preferable in some cases to an
      alternate solution outlined below.  This
      <a class="link" href="ch11s01.html#ex-sc-proxy-arp" title="Example 11.1. Proxy ARP SysV initialization script">proxy-arp script</a> reads the
      following

      Each is commented heavily so it should be clear how to use them.

      techniques.  For another explanation of the same concepts, read the
