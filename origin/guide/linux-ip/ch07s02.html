      Although the functionality offered by linux kernels for protecting
      network resources with packet filtering allows tremendously specific
      network layer access control and auditing capability, it alone cannot
      successfully and completely protect network resources.  There are
      weaknesses in and limits to the usefulness of packet filters.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pf-limits"></a>2.1. Limits of the Usefulness of Packet Filtering</h3></div></div></div><p>
        In cases where a packet filter restricts access to a resource based on
        the source IP address attempting to access that resource, the packet
        filter cannot verify whether the packets originate from the real
        device or from a host or router spoofing this source address.
        A transparent proxy illustrates this problem perfectly.  A transparent
        proxy frequently runs on a masquerading or NAT host which is connected
        to the Internet.  This machine intercepts outbound connections for a
        particular protocol (e.g, HTTP), and simulates the real server to the
        client.  The client may have a packet filter limiting outbound
        connections to a single IP and port pair, but the transparent proxy
        will still operate on the outbound connection.
      </p><p>
        This is an innocuous example, indeed.  A potentially more threatening
        example is an ssh server which accepts connections only from an IP
        range.  Any router between the two endpoints which can
        <a class="link" href="ch09s07.html" title="7. Binding to Non-local Addresses">spoof IP packets</a> will be able
        to pass the packet filter, whether it is a stateful or a
        static packet filter.  This should underscore the importance of
        solid application layer security in addition to the need for
        judiciously employed packet filtering.
      </p><p>
        A packet filter makes no effort to validate the contents of a data
        stream, so data passed over a packet filter may be bogus, invalid or
        otherwise incorrect.  The packet filter only verifies that the network
        layer datagrams are correctly addressed and well-formed
        <a href="#ftn.idm2940" class="footnote" name="idm2940"><sup class="footnote">[35]</sup></a>.
        Many security devices, such as firewalls, include support for proxies,
        which are application aware.  These are security mechanisms which can
        validate data streams.  Proxies are often integrated with packet
        filters for a tight network layer and application layer firewall.
      </p><p>
        Tunnels are one of the most common ways to subvert a packet filter.
        They come in wide varieties: ssh tunnels which allow users to
        transport TCP sessions into or out of a network; GRE tunnels, which
        allow arbitrary packets to be encapsulated in an IP packet; UDP
        tunnels; VPN tunnels; TAP/TUN tunnels; and application layer transport
        tunnels, such as RPC over HTTP/HTTPS.  Some of these tunnels are very
        difficult to prevent with packet filtering, while others are trivial to
        block.
      </p><p>
        Perhaps it is apparent, why **FIXME** adversarial relationship between
        packet filters and content....limitation of packet filter....hence
        proxies...blah blah blah.
      </p><p>
        Use of ICMP, when to block ICMP; tunneling through lax packet filters
        with ICMP (trinoo, ICMPchat).
      </p><p>
        Another area of network security which is not addressed by packet
        filtering is encryption.  Encryption can be used at a number of
        different layers in a networked environment.  Compare IPSec, encrypted
        packets, with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts a single
        application layer session.  IPSec operates at layer 3, while SSL
        operates above layer 4.  Packet filtering does not directly address
        the issue of encryption in any way.  Both are tools used in an
        ongoing effort to maintain and secure a network.
      </p><p>
        There are a few good starting place for those needing
        guidelines on securing machines.  First, the
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Security-Quickstart-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">Security
        Quickstart HOWTO</a> is a good place to begin.  There is also the
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Security-HOWTO/" target="_top">Security
        HOWTO</a>.  These and several other good general security
        resources are also available via
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/docs/" target="_top">linuxsecurity.com's
        documentation area</a>.
      </p><p>
        Much of the previous discussion applies to packet filtering
        in general, and linux suffers from the same limitations of packet
        filtering.  It is folly to assume that a good packet filter makes a
        network immune from security issues.

        The weaknesses of static (or stateless) packet filters and stateful
        packet filters are different in a few ways.  Stateless packet filters
        frequently block SYN scans of networks, but ....
      </p><p>
        Stateless packet filters. (cf. iptables connection tracking), cf. state
        vs. stateless discussion.
      </p><p>
      </p><p>
        confounded application layer protocols like FTP, H323
      </p><p>
        Because of the nature of connection tracking and state awareness,
        stateful packet filters are vulnerable to resource exhaustion and
        deliberate attempts to trip rate-limiting features.
      </p><p>
        DoS on connection tracking packet filters
        DoS on rate limiters ?

            In truth, there is some examination of data inside the network
            layer datagram.  Almost all packet filtering engines allow the
            user to distinguish between the different IP protocol types, such
            as GRE, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and even attributes of these datagrams and
            segments.  The important thing to realize is that a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>packet filter</em></span> makes no effort to examine the
            data stream.
