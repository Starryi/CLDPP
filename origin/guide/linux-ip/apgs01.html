        <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is one of the oldest IP utilities around.
        Simply put, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> asks another host if it is alive,
        and records the round-trip time between the request and the reply.
      </p><p>
        In this section, we'll look at several examples of the use of
        <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> to

      </p><p>
        The <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> utility has a simple and elegant design.
        When run, it will craft a packet bound for the specified destination,
        send the packet, and record the time it took that packet to reach its
        destination.  The generated packet is an ICMP packet known as an
        echo-request.  If the destination host receives the packet, it should
        generate an echo-reply.  The success or failure of this very simple
        operation can provide some insight into the state of a network or a
        series of networks.
      </p><a class="indexterm" name="idm5740"></a><p>
        In most cases, the ICMP echo-request packets and echo-reply packets,
        upon which <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span>'s functionality relies, are allowed
        through routers and firewalls, however with the advent of trojans and
        distributed denial of service tools which transmit information within
        ICMP packets, some networks and network administrators block ICMP at
        their borders.  For an example of such a trojan, see this
        <a class="ulink" href="http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/tfn.analysis" target="_top">dissection
        of the trinoo</a> distributed denial of service tool.  As a result
        of these nefarious uses of echo-request and echo-reply packets, some
        cautious network administrators block all non-essential ICMP at their
        border routers.  See <a class="xref" href="ch04s10.html" title="10. ICMP and Routing">Section 10, &#8220;ICMP and Routing&#8221;</a> for a more complete
        discussion of ICMP.
      </p><p>
        Thus, we can no longer assume (as perhaps we once could) that simply
        because a host is not answering our <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> request,
        this host is down.  There may be a device which has been configured to
        filter out this traffic.
      </p><p>
        If a host is reachable and answering our echo-requests, then we may
        also wish to believe that the round-trip times recorded by ping are
        an accurate representation of network conditions.  This can be
        misleading.  Some routers are configured to give ICMP diagnostic
        messages the lowest priority of any IP packets travelling through
        them, in which case that router may contribute significantly to the
        round trip time of any echo-request packet passing through it.
      </p><p>
        With knowledge of these two potential roadblocks to the successful use
        of <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> as a network diagnostic tool, we can begin
        to explore how <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is useful.  In most internal
        networks, and many public networks, there are no filters to block our
        echo-request packets.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools-ping-simple"></a>1.1. Using <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> to test reachability</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="idm5758"></a><p>
          In its simplest form, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is used interactively
          on the command line to test reachability of a remote host.  Again,
          you'll see in all of the examples below the use of the
          <code class="option">-n</code> switch to suppress DNS lookups.  Since the
          proper functioning of DNS relies on a properly configured network,
          and <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is one of your tools for diagnosing
          network problems, it makes sense to suppress all name lookup until
          you have verified that the IP layer is functioning properly.
        </p><p>
          Let's see first if the host
          <code class="systemitem">morgan</code> can reach its default gateway.  This example is similar
          to the test we performed in <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#ex-basic-ping" title="Example 1.2. Testing reachability of a locally connected host with ping">Example 1.2, &#8220;Testing reachability of a locally connected host with
          <span class="command">ping</span>&#8221;</a>
          from <code class="systemitem">tristan</code>.
        </p><p>
          On many systems, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> can be used by non-root
          users, but there are some options and features to
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> which require the user to have
          administrative privilege or root-level access to the box.
          Therefore, all examples below will be run as the root user.  Please
          be aware, that many diagnostics can be run without this high a level
          of privilege.

          We have verified from 
          <code class="systemitem">morgan</code> that its default
          gateway, <code class="systemitem">branch-router</code>
          is reachable.  The first line of output tells us what the source
          and destination addresses (and names, if using DNS) are.
          Additionally, we learn the size of the data segment of the ping
          packet, 56 bytes, and the size of the entire outbound IP packet 84
          bytes.
        </p><p>
          Each subsequent line of output before the summary is a record of the
          receipt of a reply from the destination (and what IP address sent
          the reply).  Because <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> needs to keep track of
          the number of bytes
          it has sent, and the round-trip time, each time you run ping, it
          creates a sequence number inside the data of the ping packet and
          reports the sequence number on any packets which return.  By
          analyzing the timestamps on the returned packets,
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> can determine the round trip time of the
          journey and reports this as the final field in each line of output.
        </p><p>
          At the end of the run, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> summarizes the number
          of replies, and performs some calculations on the round-trip times.
          As with much data collection, you need a large sample set of data to
          draw conclusions about your network.  You can usually conclude that
          something is quite wrong if you cannot reach a remote host, but you
          should be cautious when concluding that your Ethernet card is bad
          simply because round-trip times to a destination on the LAN is high.
          It is more likely that there's another problem.  Collecting
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> data from a number of hosts to a number of
          destinations can help you determine if the problem is a localized to
          a single machine.
        </p><p>
          Frequently, you'll want to use <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> in a script,
          or you'll want to specify that <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> should only
          run for a few cycles.  Fortunately, this is trivial (and I'll use
          the count option many times further below in this section).  The
          <code class="option">-c</code> restricts the number of packets which
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> will send (or receive).  It can be combined
          with some of the other options for a variety of diagnostic purposes.

          possible, or in a carefully controlled setting.  Unless you want to
          alienate coworkers and anger your network administrator, you shouldn't
          start a ping flood and go home for the night.

          As always, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> summarizes the output after it
          has completed its run, but let's examine the new section.  By using
          the record route option, we are asking all routers along the way to
          include their IPs in the header.  Although some routers may not
          observe this courtesy, many do.  Unfortunately, there is only room
          to record 8 different hops (FIXME--verify this!), so the use of
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> <code class="option">-R</code> is mostly useful only
          in smaller networks.
        </p><p>
          The first IP we hit is our own IP on the way out our Ethernet
          interface, 192.168.98.82.  Then it is a palindromic journey through
          the network stacks of each of the following hosts in order:
          <code class="systemitem">branch-router</code>, <code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>, <code class="systemitem">tristan</code>, and back again
          in reverse order.
        </p><p>
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is even nice enough to report to us that a
          subsequent journey took the same route as the first packet.  If you
          have a statically routed internal network, any subsequent packets
          should look exactly like the second packet.  If dynamic routing is
          in use on your internal network, you may find that the routes change
          occasionally.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools-ping-ttl"></a>1.4. Setting the TTL on a <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> packet</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="idm5910"></a><p>
          Now, frankly, I'm not sure of a practical use for the following
          option to <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span>, however, you can specify the TTL
          for an outbound echo requust packet.  By setting the TTL you are
          specifying the maximum number of hops this packet will travel before
          it will be dropped.  Conventionally, the TTL is set by the kernel to
          a reasonable number of hops (like 64).  The <code class="option">-t</code>
          provides us the capability to force the TTL for our echo requests.
          Now that we know it takes four hops to get to 
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> from <code class="systemitem">morgan</code> we should be able
          to test whether setting the TTL makes any difference.

          Clearly, we are able to reach <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> if we set the
          TTL on our echo requests to 4, but as soon as we drop the TTL to 3,
          we get a reply from the third hop (<code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>), telling
          us that our packet was too old to be forwarded to its destination.
          If you are unclear on the rationale for TTL, I'd suggest reviewing
          some of the general IP documentation available in
          <a class="xref" href="apis01.html#links-general-ip" title="1.3. General IP Networking Resources">Section 1.3, &#8220;General IP Networking Resources&#8221;</a>.

          Type of Service (ToS) is increasingly in use on backbones across the
          Internet which has brought with it Service Level Agreements (SLA).
          If you have an SLA with your provider, you may find the use of
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> <code class="option">-Q</code> to set the IP packet ToS
          flags will help you to determine if your provider is holding up
          their end of the bargain.

          Naturally, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> reports to us the round-trip

          Occasionally, you'll find yourself on a heavily packet filtered
          host, or a host which employs conditional routing for packets with
          certain source addresses.  Such packet filtering can prevent or
          conflict with the use of <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span>.  Fortunately,
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> allows the user to specify the source
          address of an outbound packet, thus allowing traversal of packet
          filters and conditional routing tables.
        </p><p>
          My classic example of a need for specifying source address on a
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is a VPN connected network.  Let's assume 
          <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> has a <a class="link" href="apes01.html" title="1. Lightweight encrypted tunnel with CIPE">CIPE</a>peer in
          another city.  Let's assume the internal IP on the peer
          is 192.168.70.254.  If <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> sends a packet
          to the peer with a source address of 205.254.211.179, the peer might
          drop the inbound packet on a VPN interface from the public IP of the
          peer
          <a href="#ftn.idm5977" class="footnote" name="idm5977"><sup class="footnote">[59]</sup></a>.
          In this case, the peer should still accept traffic from <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>
          if the originating IP is inside the private network IP range.

          As you can see, <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> is a versatile tool in the
          network administrator's toolkit, and can be used for a wide range of
          tests beyond the simple reachability test.  For a brief and
          humourous introduction to the program itself, see <a class="ulink" href="http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html" target="_top">The Story of Ping</a>.
        </p><p>
          Now that we have a good idea of the uses of the
          <span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span> utility, let's move on to some other tools
          which can provide us other diagnostic data about our networks.

              If the admin controls both sides of the link, it is a matter of
              choice and preference whether traffic from the outside IP of the
              peer VPN endpoint should be allowed.  I'll argue that traffic
              from the peer endpoint should not be allowed, but this is
              opinion only.
