        In the same way that

        the venerable utility for IP address management,

      </p><p>
        Here we'll look at several tasks you can perform with
        <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span>.  You can <a class="link" href="apds01.html#tools-route-show" title="1.1. Displaying the routing table with route">display routes</a>, <a class="link" href="apds01.html#tools-route-add" title="1.4. Creating a static route with route add">add routes</a> (most importantly, the

        I will switch between traditional and CIDR notation for network

        When using <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>ip route</strong></span> on
        the same machine, it is important to understand that not all routing
        table entries can be shown with <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span>.  The key
        distinction is that <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> only displays
        information in the main routing table.  NAT routes, and routes in
        tables other than the main routing table must be managed and viewed
        separately with the <a class="link" href="apds02.html" title="2. ip route"><span class="command"><strong>ip
        route</strong></span></a> tool.

          By far the simplest and most common task one performs with
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> is 
          viewing the routing table.  On a single-homed desktop like
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code>, the routing
          table will be very simple, probably comprised of only a few routes.
          Compare this to a complex routing table on a host with multiple
          interfaces and static routes to internal networks, such as
          <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>.  It is by using
          the <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> command that you can determine where a
          packet goes when it leaves your machine.

          In the simplest routing tables, as in
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code>'s case, you'll
          see three separate routes.  The route which is customarily present
          on all machines (and which I'll not remark on after this) is the
          route to the loopback interface.  The loopback interface is an IP
          interface completely local to the host itself.  Most commonly,
          loopback is configured as a single IP address in a class A-sized
          network.  This entire network has been set aside for use on loopback
          devices.  The address used is usually 127.0.0.1/8, and the device
          name under all default installations of linux I have seen is
          <span class="command"><strong>lo</strong></span>.  It is not at all unheard of for people to
          host services on loopback which are intended only for consumption on
          that machine, e.g., SMTP on tcp/25.
        </p><p>
          The remaining two lines define how 
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> should reach any
          other IP address anywhere on the Internet.  These two routing table
          entries divide the world into two different categories: a locally
          reachable network (192.168.99.0/24) and everything else.  If an
          address falls within the 192.168.99.0/24 range, 
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> knows it can
          reach the IP range directly on the wire, so any packets bound for
          this range will be pushed out onto the local media.
        </p><p>
          If the packet falls in any other range
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> will consult its
          routing table and find no single route that matches.  In this case,
          the default route functions as a terminal choice.  If no other route
          matches, the packet will be forwarded to this destination address,
          which is usually a router to another set of networks and routers
          (which eventually lead to the Internet).
        </p><p>
          Viewing a complex routing table is no more difficult than viewing a
          simple routing table, although it can be a bit more diffiult to
          read, interpret, and sometimes even find the route you wish to
          examine.

          The above routing table shows a more complex set of static routes
          than one finds on a single-homed host.  By comparing the network
          mask of the routes above, we can see that the network mask is listed
          from the most specific to the least specific.  Refer to
          <a class="xref" href="ch04s05.html" title="5. Route Selection">Section 5, &#8220;Route Selection&#8221;</a> for more discussion.
        </p><p>
          A quick glance down this routing table also provides us with a good
          deal of knowledge about the topology of the network.  Immediately we
          can identify four separate Ethernet interfaces, 3 locally connected
          class C sized networks, and one tiny subnet (192.168.100.0/30).  We
          can also determine that there are two networks reachable via static
          routes behind internal routers.
        </p><p>
          Now that we have taken a quick glance at the output from the route
          command, let's examine a bit more systematically what it's reporting
          to us.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools-route-output"></a>1.2. Reading <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span>'s output</h3></div></div></div><p>
          For this discussion refer to the network map in the appendix, and
          also to <a class="xref" href="apds01.html#ex-tools-route-show-complex" title="Example D.2. Viewing a complex routing table with route">Example D.2, &#8220;Viewing a complex routing table with <span class="command">route</span>&#8221;</a>.
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> is a venerable command, one which can
          manipulate routing tables for protocols other than IP.  If you wish
          to know what other protocols are supported, try <strong class="userinput"><code>route
          --help</code></strong> at your leisure.  Fortunately,
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> defaults to inet (IPv4) routes if no other
          address family is specified.
        </p><p>
          By combining the values in columns one and three you can determine
          the destination network or host address.  The first line in 
          <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>'s routing table
          shows 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.252, which is more conveniently
          written in CIDR notation as 192.168.100.0/30.  This is the smallest
          possible network according to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1878.txt" target="_top">RFC 1878</a>.  The
          only two useable addresses are 192.168.100.1 
          (<code class="systemitem">service-router</code>)
          and 192.168.100.2
          (<code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>).
        </p><p>
          The second column holds the IP address of the gateway to the
          destination if the destination is not a locally connected network.
          If there is a value other than 0.0.0.0 in this field, the kernel
          will address the outbound packet for this device (a router of some
          kind) rather than directly for the destination.  The column after
          the netmask column (Flags) should always contain a
          <span class="command"><strong>G</strong></span> for destination not locally connected to the
          linux machine.
        </p><p>
          The fields Metric, Ref and Use are not generally used in simple or
          even moderately complex routing tables, however, we will discuss the
          Use column further in <a class="xref" href="apds01.html#tools-route-show-cache" title="1.3. Using route to display the routing cache">Section 1.3, &#8220;Using <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> to display the routing cache&#8221;</a>.
        </p><p>
          The final field in the <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> output contains the
          name of the interface through which the destination is reachable.
          This can be any interface known to the kernel which has an IP
          address.  In <a class="xref" href="apds01.html#ex-tools-route-show-complex" title="Example D.2. Viewing a complex routing table with route">Example D.2, &#8220;Viewing a complex routing table with <span class="command">route</span>&#8221;</a> we can
          learn immediately that 192.168.98.0/24 is reachable through
          interface <code class="constant">eth2</code>.
        </p><p>
          After this brief examination of the commonest of output from
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span>, let's look at some of the other things we
          can learn from <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> and also how we can change
          the routing table.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools-route-show-cache"></a>1.3. Using <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> to display the routing cache</h3></div></div></div><p>
          The routing cache is used by the kernel as a lookup table analogous
          to a quick reference card.  It's faster for the kernel to refer to
          the cache (internally implemented as a hash table) for a recently
          used route than to lookup the destination address again.  Routes
          existing in the route cache are periodically expired.  If you need
          to clean out the routing cache entirely, you'll want to become
          familiar with <a class="link" href="apds02.html#tools-ip-route-flush" title="2.9. Clearing routing tables with ip route flush"><span class="command"><strong>ip
          route flush cache</strong></span></a>.
        </p><p>
          At first, it might surprise you to learn that there are no entries
          for locally connected networks in a routing cache.  After a bit of
          reflection, you come to realize that there is on need to cache an IP
          route for a locally connected network because the machine is
          connected to the same Ethernet.  So, any given destination has an
          entry in either the arp table or in the routing cache.  For a
          clearer picture of the differences between each of the cached
          routse, I'd suggest adding a <code class="option">-e</code> switch.

          Static routes are explicit routes to non-local destinations through
          routers or gateways which are not the default gateway.  The case of
          the routing table on 
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> is a classic
          example of the need for a static route.  There are two routers in
          the same network, 
          <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>.  If 
          <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> has packets for
          the 192.168.98.0/24 network, they should be routed to 192.168.99.1
          (<code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>).  Refer
          also to <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#basic-changing-static" title="3.3. Adding and removing a static route">Section 3.3, &#8220;Adding and removing a static route&#8221;</a> for this example.
        </p><p>
          As with <a class="link" href="apcs01.html" title="1. ifconfig"><span class="command"><strong>ifconfig</strong></span></a>,
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> has a syntax unlike most standard unix
          command line utilities, mixing options and arguments with less
          regularity.  Note the mandatory <code class="option">-net</code> or
          <code class="option">-host</code> options when adding or removing any route
          other than the default route.
        </p><p>
          In order to add a static route to the routing table, you'll need to
          gather several pieces of information about the remote network.
        </p><p>
          In our example network, 
          <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> can only reach
          10.38.0.0/16 through 
          <code class="systemitem">service-router</code>.  Let's
          add a static route to the masquerading firewall to ensure that
          10.38.0.0/16 is reachable.  Our intended routing table will look
          like the routing table in
          <a class="xref" href="apds01.html#ex-tools-route-show-complex" title="Example D.2. Viewing a complex routing table with route">Example D.2, &#8220;Viewing a complex routing table with <span class="command">route</span>&#8221;</a>.
          Let's also view the output
          if we mistype the IP address of the default gateway and specify an

          It should be clear now that the gateway address must be reachable on
          a locally connected network for a static route to be useable (or
          even make sense).  In the first line, where we mistyped, the route
          could not be added to the routing table because the gateway address
          was not a reachable address.
        </p><p>
          Now, instead of sending packets with a destination of 10.38.0.0/16
          to the default gateway, 
          <code class="systemitem">wan-gw</code>,
          <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> will send this
          traffic to 
          <code class="systemitem">service-router</code> at IP
          address 192.168.100.1.
        </p><p>
          The above is a simple example of routing a network to a separate
          gateway, a gateway other than the default gateway.  This is a common
          need on networks central to an operation, and less common in branch
          offices and remote networks.
        </p><p>
          Occasionally, however, you'll have a single machine with an IP
          address in a different range on the same Ethernet as some other
          machines.  Or you might have a single machine which is reachable
          via a router.  Let's look at these two scenarios to see how we can
          create static routes to solve this routing need.
        </p><p>
          Occasionally, you may have a desire to restrict communication from
          one network to another by not including routes to the network.
          In our sample network, <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> may be a
          workstation of an employee who doesn't need to reach any machines in
          the branch office.  Perhaps this employee needs to periodically
          access some data or service supplied on 192.168.98.101.  We'll need
          to add a static route to allow this machine to access this single
          host IP in the branch office network

          Even rarer, you may encounter a situation where a single Ethernet
          network is used to host multiple IP networks.  There are reasons
          people might do this, although I regard this is bad form.  If
          possible, it is cleaner, more secure, and easier to troubleshoot if
          you do not share IP networks on the same media segment.  With that
          said, you can still convince your linux box to be a part of each
          network

          Let's assume for the sake of this example that NAT is not an option
          for us, and we need to move the machine 205.254.211.184 into another
          network.  Though it violates the concept of security partitioning,
          we have decided to put the server into the same network as
          <code class="systemitem">service-router</code>.
          Naturally, we'll need to modify the routing table on

          I'll leave as an exercise to the reader's imagination the question
          of how to send all traffic to a locally connected network to an
          interface.  In light of the host route above, it should be a logical
          step for the reader to make.
        </p><p>
          The above are common examples of the usage of the
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> command.
        </p><p>
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools-route-add-default"></a>1.5. Creating a default route with <span class="command"><strong>route add default</strong></span></h3></div></div></div><p>
          The default route is a special case of a static route.  Any machine
          which is connected to the Internet has a default route.  For the
          majority of smaller networks which are not running dynamic routing
          protocols, each machine on an internal network uses a router or
          firewall as its default gateway, forwarding all traffic to that
          destination.  Typically, this router or firewall forwards the
          traffic to the next router or device via a static route until the
          traffic reaches the ISP's service access router.  Many ISPs use
          dynamic routing internally to determine the best path out of their
          networks to remote destinations.
        </p><p>
          But we are only interested in adding a default route and
          understanding that packets are reaching the default gateway.  Once
          the packets have reached the default gateway, we assume that the
          administrator of that device is monitoring its correct operation.
        </p><p>
          With this bit of background about the default route, it is easy to
          see why a default route is a key part of any networking device's
          configuration.  If the machine is to reach machines other than the
          machines on the local network, it must know the address of the
          default gateway.
        </p><p>
          Because the default gateway is so important, there is particular
          support for adding a default route included in the
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> command.  Refer to
          <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#ex-basic-set-default" title="Example 1.8. Adding a default route with route">Example 1.8, &#8220;Adding a default route with <span class="command">route</span>&#8221;</a> for a simple
          example of adding a
          default route.  The syntax of the command is as follows:
        </p><div class="example"><a name="ex-tools-route-add-default"></a><p class="title"><b>Example D.7. Setting the default route with <span class="command">route</span></b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

          </pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>
          This is the commonest method used for setting a default route,
          although the route can also be specified by the following command.
          I find the alternate method more explicit than the common method for
          setting default gateway, because the destination address and network
          mask are treated exactly like any other network address and netmask.
        </p><div class="example"><a name="ex-tools-route-add-default-alt"></a><p class="title"><b>Example D.8. An alternate method of setting the default route with <span class="command">route</span></b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

          </pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>
          The alternate method of setting a default route specifies a network
          and netmask of 0, which is shorthand for all destinations.  I'll
          reiterate that the kernel sees these two methods of setting the
          default route as identical.  The resulting routing table is exactly
          the same.  You may select whichever of these
          <span class="command"><strong>route</strong></span> invocations you find more comfortable.
        </p><p>
          Now that we have covered adding static routes and the special static
          route, the default route, let's try our hand at removing existing
          routes from routing tables.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tools-route-del"></a>1.6. Removing routes with <span class="command"><strong>route del</strong></span></h3></div></div></div><p>
          Any route can be removed from the routing table as easily as it can
          be added.  The syntax of the command is exactly the same as the
          syntax of the <span class="command"><strong>route add</strong></span> command.
        </p><p>
          After we went to all of the trouble above to put our machine
          205.254.211.184 into the network with
          <code class="systemitem">service-router</code>, we
          probably realize that from a security partitioning standpoint, it is
          not only stupid, but also foolhardy!  So now, we conclude that we
          need to return 205.254.211.184 to its former network (the DMZ
          proper).  We'll now remove the special host route for its IP, so the
          network route for 205.254.211.0/24 will now be used for reaching
          this host.  (If you have questions about why, read

          Another possible example might be the prohibition of Internet
          traffic to a particular user.  If a machine does not have a default
          route, but instead has a routing table populated only with routes to
          internal networks, then that machine can only reach IP addresses in
          networks to which it has a routing table entry.  Let's say that you
          have a user who routinely spends work hours browsing the Internet,
          fetching mail from a POP account outside your network, and in short
          wastes time on the Internet.  You can easily prevent this user from
          reaching anything except your internal networks.  Naturally, this
          sort of a problem employee should probably face some sort of
          administrative sanction to address the real problem, but as a
          technical component of the strategy to prevent this user from
          wasting time on the Internet, you could remove access to the
          Internet from this employee's machine.
