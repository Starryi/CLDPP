      One of the most difficult aspects of working with the advanced routing
      features of linux is gaining an understanding the sequence of events
      as a packet traverses the kernel space.  It is, in fact, the key
      knowledge needed to grasp the potential of advanced routing scenarios
      and to troubleshoot successfully when things don't go as planned.

      If you are reading this for the first time, stop now and go visit and
      study 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://docum.org/stef.coene/qos/kptd/" target="_top">the kernel
      packet traveling diagram</a> and
      <a class="ulink" href="http://open-source.arkoon.net/kernel/kernel_net.png" target="_top">the
      kernel packet handling diagram</a> now.  These represent two
      different efforts to describe the order in which different
      networking subsystems inside the linux kernel have an opportunity to
      inspect, manipulate and redirect a packet.  Understanding this
      sequence of events is key to harnessing the power of linux networking.
    </p><p>
      Now, let's examine some of the different commands you can use to
      manipulate packets at each of these stages.  The list below describes
      the sequence of events for a packet bound for a non-local destination.

          All of the PREROUTING netfilter hooks are called here.  This
          means that we get our first opportunity to inspect and drop a
          packet, we can perform DNAT on the packet to make sure that the
          destination IP is rewritten before we make a routing decision
          (at which time the destination address becomes very important).
          We can also set ToS or an fwmark on the packet at this time.  If
          we want to use an IMQ device for ingress control, we can put our
          hooks here.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

          The input routing stage is traversed by any packet entering the
          local machine.  Here we concern ourselves only with packets which
          are routed through this machine to another destination
          Additionally, iproute2 NAT occurs here

        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The packet enters the FORWARD netfilter hooks.  Here, the packet
          can be mangled with ToS or fwmark.  After the mangle chain is
          passed, the filter chain will be traversed.  For kernel 2.4-based
          routing devices this will be the location for packet filtering
          rules.  If we are using ipchains, the forward chain would be
          traversed here instead of the netfilter FORWARD hooks.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The output chain in an ipchains installation would be traversed

          packet mangling, NAT and IMQ for egress.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Finally, the packet is transmitted via the outbound device per
          traffic control configuration on that outbound device.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      The above describes the sequence of events for packets passing through
      the linux routing device.  Let's look at a similar descriptions of the
      paths that packets bound for local destinations take through the
      kernel.

          The INPUT netfilter hooks are traversed.  Commonly this is

          The local destination process receives the connection.  If there
          is no open socket, an error is generated.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Naturally, packets need to go out from the machine as well, so let's
      look at the path for outbound packets which were locally generated.

          The routing decision is made.  This is frequently called output
          routing because it is only for packets leaving the system.  This
          routing code is (sometimes?) responsible for selecting the source
          IP of the outbound packet.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The netfilter OUTPUT hooks are traversed.  The basic filter, nat,
          and mangle hooks are available.  This is where SNAT can take
