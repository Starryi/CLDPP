      Crucial to the proper ability of hosts to exchange IP packets is the
      correct selection of a route to the destination.  The rules for the
      selection of route path are traditionally made on a
      
      hop-by-hop basis
      <a href="#ftn.idm1694" class="footnote" name="idm1694"><sup class="footnote">[18]</sup></a>
      based solely upon the destination address of the packet.  Linux
      behaves as a conventional routing device in this way, but can also 
      provide a more flexible capability.  Routes can be chosen and
      prioritized based on other packet characteristics.
    </p><p>
      The route selection algorithm under linux has been generalized to
      enable the powerful latter scenario without complicating the
      overwhelmingly common case of the former scenario.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="routing-selection-common"></a>5.1. The Common Case</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The above sections on routing to a
        <a class="link" href="ch04s02.html" title="2. Routing to Locally Connected Networks">local network</a> and
        <a class="link" href="ch04s03.html" title="3. Sending Packets Through a Gateway">the default gateway</a>
        expose the importance of destination address for route selection.
        In this simplified model, the kernel need only know the destination
        address of the packet, which it compares against the routing tables to
        determine the route by which to send the packet.
      </p><p>
        The kernel searches for a matching entry for the destination first in
        the routing cache and then the main routing table.
        In the case that the machine has recently transmitted a
        packet to the destination address, the
        <a class="link" href="ch04s07.html" title="7. Routing Cache">routing cache</a> will contain an
        entry for the destination.  The kernel will select the same route, and
        transmit the packet accordingly.
      </p><p>
        If the linux machine has not recently transmitted a packet to this
        destination address, it will look up the destination in its routing
        table using a technique known longest prefix match
        <a href="#ftn.idm1705" class="footnote" name="idm1705"><sup class="footnote">[19]</sup></a>.
        In practical terms, the concept of longest prefix match means that the
        most specific route to the destination will be chosen.
      </p><a name="routing-selection-lpm"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1709"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idm1712"></a><p>
        The use of the
        longest prefix match allows routes for large networks to be
        overridden by more specific host or network routes, as required in
        <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#ex-basic-del-static" title="Example 1.10. Removing a static network route and adding a static host route">Example 1.10, &#8220;Removing a static network route and adding a static host
          route&#8221;</a>, for example.  Conversely, it is
        this same property of longest prefix match which allows routes to
        individual destinations to be aggregated into larger network
        addresses.  Instead of entering individual routes for each host, large
        numbers of contiguous network addresses can be aggregated.  This is
        the realized promise of CIDR networking.  See
        <a class="xref" href="apis01.html#links-general-ip" title="1.3. General IP Networking Resources">Section 1.3, &#8220;General IP Networking Resources&#8221;</a> for further details.
      </p><p>
        In the common case, route selection is based completely on the
        destination address.  Conventional (as opposed to policy-based) IP
        networking relies on only the destination address to select a route
        for a packet.
      </p><p>
        Because the majority of linux systems have no need of policy
        based routing
        features, they use the conventional routing technique of longest
        prefix match.  While this meets the needs of a large subset of
        linux networking needs, there are unrealized policy routing features
        in a machine operating in this fashion.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="routing-selection-adv"></a>5.2. The Whole Story</h3></div></div></div><p>
        With the prevalence of low cost bandwidth, easily configured VPN
        tunnels, and increasing reliance on networks, the technique of
        selecting a route based solely on the destination IP address range no
        longer suffices for all situations.
        The discussion of the common case
        of route selection under linux neglects one
        of the most powerful features in the linux IP stack.
        Since kernel 2.2, linux has
        supported policy based routing through the use of
        <a class="link" href="ch04s08.html" title="8. Routing Tables">multiple routing tables</a> and the
        <a class="link" href="ch04s09.html" title="9. Routing Policy Database (RPDB)">routing policy database (RPDB)</a>.
        Together, they allow a network
        administrator to configure a machine select different routing
        tables and routes based on a number of criteria.
      </p><p>
        Selectors available for use in policy-based routing are
        attributes of a packet
        passing through the linux routing code.  The source address of a
        packet, the ToS flags, an fwmark (a mark carried through the kernel in
        the data structure representing the packet), and the interface name on
        which the packet was received are attributes which can be used as
        selectors.  By selecting a routing table based
        on packet attributes, an administrator can have
        granular control over the network path of any packet.
      </p><p>
        With this knowledge of the RPDB and multiple
        routing tables, let's revisit in detail the method by which the
        kernel selects the proper route for a packet.  Understanding
        the series of steps the kernel takes for route selection should
        demystify advanced routing.  In fact, advanced routing could more
        accurately be called policy-based networking.
      </p><p>
        When determining the route by which to send a packet, the kernel always
        <a class="link" href="ch04s07.html" title="7. Routing Cache">consults the routing cache first</a>.
        The routing cache is a hash table used for quick access to recently
        used routes.  If the kernel finds an entry in the routing cache, the
        corresponding entry will be used.  If there is no entry in the
        routing cache, the kernel begins the process of route selection.  For
        details on the method of matching a route in the routing cache, see
        <a class="xref" href="ch04s07.html" title="7. Routing Cache">Section 7, &#8220;Routing Cache&#8221;</a>.
      </p><p>
        The kernel begins iterating by priority through the routing policy
        database.  For each matching entry in the RPDB, the kernel will try to
        find a matching route to the destination IP
        address in the specified routing table using the aforementioned
        longest prefix match selection algorithm.  When a matching destination
        is found, the kernel will select the matching route, and forward the
        packet.  If no matching entry is found in the specified routing table,
        the kernel will pass to the next rule in the RPDB, until it finds a
        match or falls through the end of the RPDB and all consulted routing
        tables.
      </p><p>
        Here is a snippet of python-esque pseudocode to illustrate the
        kernel's route selection process again.  Each of the lookups below
        occurs in kernel hash tables which are accessible to the user through
        the use of various <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> tools.

        A common mistake when working with multiple routing tables involves
        forgetting about the statelessness of IP routing.  This manifests when
        the user configuring the policy routing machine accounts for outbound
        packets (via <code class="constant">fwmark</code>, or <span class="command"><strong>ip rule</strong></span>
        selectors), but forgets to account for the return packets.
