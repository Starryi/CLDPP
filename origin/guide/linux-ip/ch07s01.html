      Packet filtering refers to the technique of conditionally allowing
      or denying packets entering or exiting a network or host based on
      the characteristics of that packet.  There are two fundamental types of
      packet filters.  A static packet filter is a set of rules against which
      every packet is checked, and allowed or denied.
      A dynamic packet filter keeps track of the connections currently passing
      the firewall.  This is usually described as a stateful or dynamic packet
      filtering engine.  Netfilter provides the capability for linux (2.4+) to
      operate as a stateful packet filtering device.
    </p><p>
      For a brief digression, consider the term <em class="wordasword">stateful packet
      inspection</em>.  This term has been used in two distinctly
      different meanings.  At least one commercial security company
      differentiates between stateful packet filtering and stateful packet
      inspection
      <a href="#ftn.idm2911" class="footnote" name="idm2911"><sup class="footnote">[34]</sup></a>.
      Supposedly, a stateful packet inspection engine is able to examine the
      contents of a packet and make a limited guess as to the legitimacy of
      the application layer content.  While I would call this an application
      layer proxy, I do not use the product.  For the purposes of this
      documentation, the terms stateful packet inspection and stateful packet
      filtering are synonomous.
    </p><p>
      Packet filtering, the network layer portion of a firewall solution, is
      one part of a good security stance.  As the embodiment and manifestation
      of an organizational security policy for network layer traffic, the
      packet filter restricts traffic flows between networks and hosts.  There
      is tremendous value from a security perspective in enforcing these
      traffic flows, instead of allowing arbitrary traffic flow.
    </p><p>
      The use of packet filtering to enforce these traffic flows is not
      restricted to routers and firewalls alone.  Standalone servers and
      workstations can use these same tools to protect themselves.  There
      are a couple of common approaches to packet filtering.  Generally,
      network security professionals subscribe to the notion that the
      filtering policy should deny or drop all traffic and selectively allow
      desired traffic.  An alternate, more open, policy suggests allowing
      everything, selectively blocking undesirable traffic.
    </p><p>
      The languages used in most packet filtering tools for describing IP
      packets allow for a great deal of specifity when identifying traffic.
      This specifity enables an administrator a great deal of flexibility for
      protecting resources and limiting traffic flows.

        Packet filtering under linux has a long history, punctuated by major
        alterations in the packet filtering systems included in the kernel.  In
        the mid- and late-1990s, <span class="command"><strong>ipfwadm</strong></span> exposed the three
        packet filtering chains of kernel 2.0 to the user: in, forward, and out.
        Individual entries added to these chains would be traversed in order in
        each ruleset.  The first matching rule in each chain would be used, and
        every packet passing through a router would traverse these three
        chains.
      </p><p>
        With the advent of linux 2.2, users could create their own chains and
        chain structures.  The kernel architecture was different from that of
        the earlier kernel, but from the user's perspective, the manner in
        which the rules were written was only slightly different.  Rule
        chains, traversed rather like subroutines and manipulated with
        <span class="command"><strong>ipchains</strong></span>, could be arbitrarily complex and nested.
        The built-in packet filtering chains had names:  input, output and
        forward.  The first matching rule in any chain called from one of the
        built-in chains would be used.  Every packet passing through a router
        would traverse (at least) the three built-in rule chains.  There is
        backward compatible support for <span class="command"><strong>ipfwadm</strong></span> syntax via
        a wrapper shell script which converts the command to an
        <span class="command"><strong>ipchains</strong></span> syntax.
      </p><p>
        In kernel 2.4, the
        <a class="link" href="ch07s04.html" title="4. The Netfilter Architecture">netfilter architecture</a>
        which provides functionality other than packet filtering, allows users
        to create the arbitrary chains and chain structures similar to those
        supported by linux 2.2.  The built in chains are INPUT, FORWARD, and
        OUTPUT.  A major difference in the use of chains was introduced in
        linux 2.4; packets passing through a router will traverse the FORWARD
        chain only.  User-defined <span class="command"><strong>iptables</strong></span> chains resemble
        branches rather than subroutines.  Under linux 2.4,
        <span class="command"><strong>ipchains</strong></span> compatibility is maintained with a kernel
        module.  For <span class="command"><strong>ipfwadm</strong></span> compatibility, the kernel
        module and the aforementioned wrapper shell script function
        adequately.
      </p><p>
        The packet filtering support under linux has grown increasingly
        complex and mature with successive kernels and development efforts on
        the user space tools.  The netfilter architecture of linux 2.4
        represented a tremendous step forward in the packet filtering
        capabilities of linux with support for stateful packet filtering.
