      The questions summarized in this section should rightly be entered
      into the FAQ, since they are FAQs on the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://mailman.ds9a.nl/mailman/listinfo/lartc" target="_top">LARTC
      list</a>.
    </p><p>
      There are many places where a linux based router/masquerading device
      can assist in managing multiple Internet connections.  We'll outline
      here some of the more common setups involving multiple Internet
      connections and how to manage them with <span class="command"><strong>iptables</strong></span>,
      <span class="command"><strong>ipchains</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span>.  One of
      the first distinctions you can make when planning how to use multiple
      Internet connections is what inbound services you expect to host and
      how you want to split traffic over the multiple links.
    </p><p>
      In the discussion and examples below, I'll address the issues involved
      with two separate uplinks to two different providers.  I assume the
      following:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          You are not using BGP, and you do not have your own AS.  If you
          are using BGP and have your own AS, you have a different set of

      In the following sections we'll look at the use of multiple Internet

        Internet</h3></div></div></div><p>
        There are two main uses for multiple Internet links connected to the
        same internal network.  One common use is to select an outbound link
        based on the type of outbound service.  The other is to split traffic
        arbitrarily across multiple ISPs for reasons like failover and to
        accommodate greater aggregate bandwidth than would be available
        on a single uplink.
      </p><p>
        If your need is the latter, please consult the documentation on the
        <a class="ulink" href="http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html" target="_top">LARTC
        site</a>, as it does a good job of summarizing the issues
        involved and describes how to accomplish this.  This type of use of
        multiple Internet connections means that (from the perspective of
        the linux routing device), there is a multipath default route.  The
        LARTC documentation remarks that Julian Anastasov's patches "make
        things nicer to work with."  The patches to which the LARTC
        documents are referring are Julian's dead gateway detection
        patches (at least) which can help the linux routing device provide
        Internet service to the internal network when one of the links is
        down.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#routes" target="_top">here for
        Julian's route work</a>.
      </p><p>
        In the remainder of this section, we'll discuss how to classify
        traffic for different ISPs, how to handle the packet filtering for
        this sort of classification scheme, and how to create routing tables
        appropriate for the task at hand.
        If anything at all seems unclear in this section, you may find a
        quick re-reading of <a class="link" href="ch10s02.html" title="2. Overview of Routing and Packet Filter Interactions">the advanced
        routing overview</a> quite fruitful.
      </p><p>
        The simplest way to split Internet access into two separate groups
        is by source IP of the outbound packet.  This can be done most
        simply with <span class="command"><strong>ip rule</strong></span> and a second routing table.
        We'll assume that <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> in the example network gets a second,
        low cost network connection through a DSL vendor.
      </p><p>
        The DSL IP on <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> will be 67.17.28.12 with a gateway of
        67.17.28.14.  We'll assume that this is for outbound connectivity
        only, and that the IP is active on eth4 of the <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> machine.
        Before beginning let's outline the process we are going to follow.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Copy the main routing table to another routing table and set the

        Now, exactly what have we just done?  We have created two routing

        With these <span class="command"><strong>iptables</strong></span> lines we have instructed
        netfilter to mark packets matching these criteria with the fwmark
        and we have prepared the NAT rules so that our outbound packets will
        originate from the correct IPs.
      </p><p>
        Once again, it is important to realize that the fwmark added
        to a packet is only valid and discernible while the packet is
        still on the host running the packet filter.  The fwmark is stored
        in a data structure the kernel uses to track the packet.
        Because the fwmark is not a part of the packet itself, the fwmark is
        lost as soon as the packet has left the local machine.  For more
        detail on the use of fwmark, see
        <a class="xref" href="ch10s03.html#adv-routing-fwmark" title="3.2. Using fwmark for Policy Routing">Section 3.2, &#8220;Using fwmark for Policy Routing&#8221;</a>.
      </p><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> supports the use of fwmark as a selector
        for rule lookups, so we can use fwmarks in the routing policy
        database to cause packets to be conditionally routed based on that
        fwmark.  This can lead to great complexity if a machine has multiple
        routing tables, packet filters, and other fancy networking tools,
        such as NAT or proxies.  Caveat emptor.
      </p><p>
        A convention I find sensible is to use the same number for a routing
        table and fwmark where possible.  This simplifies the maintenance of
        the systems which are using <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> and fwmark,
        especially if the table identifier and fwmark are set in a
        configuration file with the same variable name.  Since we are
        testing this on the command line, we'll just make sure that we can
        add the rules first.
      </p><div class="example"><a name="ex-adv-multi-internet-outbound-ip-rule"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 10.3. Multiple Outbound Internet links, part III;

        The last piece is in place.  Now, users in the 192.168.99.0/24 subnet
        who are browsing the Internet should be using the DSL line instead
        of the T1 line for connectivity.
      </p><p>
        In order to verify that traffic is indeed getting marked and
        routed appropriately, you should use <span class="command"><strong>tcpdump</strong></span> to
        profile the outbound traffic on each link at the same time as you
        generate outbound traffic on both links.  
      </p><p>
        The above is a cookbook example of categorizing traffic,
        and sending the traffic out across different
        providers.  To my knowledge, the commonest reason to use this sort
        of solution is to separate traffic by importance and use a reliable
        (and perhaps more costly) link for the more important traffic while
        reserving the less costly Internet connection for other connections.
        In the above illustrative case, we have simply selected the web
        traffic for the less reliable (DSL) provider.
      </p><p>
        Once again, if you would like to split load over multiple links
        regardless of classification of traffic, then you really want a
        multipath default route, which is described and documented very well

        There are many different ways to handle hosting servers to multiple
        ISPs, and most of them are out of the scope of this document.  If
        you are in need of this sort of advanced networking, you probably
        already know where to research.  If not, I'd suggest starting your
        research in load balancing, global load balancing, failover, and
        layer 4-7 switching.  These are networking tools which can
        facilitate the management of a highly available service.
      </p><p>
        Publishing the same service on two different ISPs is can be
        formidable challenge.  While this is possible using
        some of the advanced networking features under linux, one should
        understand the greater issues involved with publishing a service on
        two public IPs, especially if the idea is to provide service to the
        general Internet even if one of the ISPs go down.  For a
        thorough examination of the topics involved with load balancing of
        all kinds, see Chandra Kopparapu's book Load Balancing Servers,
        Firewalls and Caches.
      </p><p>
        If you are aware of the many difficult issues involved in handling
        inbound connections to a network, and still want to publish a
        service on two different ISPs (perhaps before you have a more robust
        load balancing/upper layer switching technology in place), you'll
        find the recipe below.
      </p><p>
        Before we examine the recipe, let's look at a complex scenario to
        see what the crucial points are.  If you do not have the
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.docum.org/stef.coene/qos/kptd/" target="_top">kernel
        packet traveling diagram</a> memorized, you may wish to refer to
        it in the following discussion.  One other item to remember is that
        routing decisions are stateless
        <a href="#ftn.idm3426" class="footnote" name="idm3426"><sup class="footnote">[39]</sup></a>.
      </p><p>
        We'll assume that the client IP is a fixed IP (64.70.12.210) and
        we'll discuss how this client IP would reach each of the services 
        published on <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>'s two public networks.  The IPs used for
        the services will be 67.17.28.10 and 205.254.211.17.
        Now, whether you are using NAT with <span class="command"><strong>iproute2</strong></span> or
        with iptables, you'll run across the problem here outlined.  Here
        is the flow of the packet through <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> to the server and back
        to the client.

            packet is transmitted out eth1
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
        This is the problem!  The packet may have the correct source
        address, but it is leaving via the wrong interface.  Many ISPs
        filter traffic entering their network and will block traffic from
        your network with source IPs outside your allocated range.  To an
        ISP this looks like spoofed traffic.
      </p><p>
        The solution is marvelously elegant and simple.  Select one IP on
        the internal server which will be reachable via one provider and one
        IP which will be reachable via the other provider.  By using two IP
        addresses on the internal machine, we can use <span class="command"><strong>ip
        rule</strong></span> on <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> to select a routing table with a
        different default route based upon the source IP of the response
        packets to clients.  Below, we'll assume the same routing tables as
        in the previous section (cf.
        <a class="xref" href="ch10s04.html#adv-multi-internet-outbound" title="4.1. Outbound traffic Using Multiple Connections to the Internet">Section 4.1, &#8220;Outbound traffic Using Multiple Connections to the
        Internet&#8221;</a>).
      </p><p>
        Here we have a server <code class="systemitem">isolde</code> which needs to be accessible via two
        different public IP addresses.  We'll add an IP address to <code class="systemitem">isolde</code>
        so that it is reachable on 192.168.100.10 as well as 192.168.100.17.
        Then, the following rules on <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> will ensure that packets are
        rewritten and routed in order to avoid the problem pointed out

                Sometimes it may not be quite proper to simply copy the main
                routing table to another routing table.  You may want a
                subset of hosts on the internal network to access the
                alternate link.  Anybody have any sage advice here for the
                newbie in multiple routing tables?
