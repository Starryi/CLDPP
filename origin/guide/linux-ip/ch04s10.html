      ICMP is a very important part of the communication between hosts on
      IP networks.  Used by routers and endpoints (clients and servers)
      ICMP communicates error conditions in networks and
      provides a means for endpoints to receive information
      about a network path or requested connection.
    </p><p>
      One of the commonest uses of ICMP by the administrator of a network is
      the use of
      <a class="link" href="apgs01.html" title="1. ping"><span class="command"><strong>ping</strong></span></a> to detect the
      state of a machine in the network.  There are other types of ICMP which
      are used for other inter-computer communication.  One other common type
      of ICMP is the ICMP returned by a router or host which is not accepting
      connections.  Essentially, the host returns the ICMP as a polite method
      of saying <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Go away.</span>&#8221;</span>.
    </p><p>
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="routing-icmp-mtu"></a>10.1. MTU, MSS, and ICMP</h3></div></div></div><p>
        One important use of ICMP, which is completely transparent
        to most users (and indeed many admins), is the use of ICMP to discover
        the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU).  By discovering the Path MTU
        and transmitting packets with this the MTU, a host can
        minimize the delay of traffic due to fragmentation, and
        (theoretically) attain a more even rate of data transmission.  Because
        each destination may have a different MTU due to different network
        paths, the MTU is a per route attribute stored in the
        <a class="link" href="ch04s07.html" title="7. Routing Cache">routing cache</a>.
      </p><p>
        Path MTU can be quite easily broken if any single hop along the way
        blocks all ICMP.  Be sure to allow ICMP unreachable/fragmentation
        needed packets into and out of your network.  This will prevent you
        from being one of the unclueful network admins who cause PMTU
        problems.

        An ICMP redirect is a router's way of communicating
        that there is a better path out of this network or into another one
        than the one the host had chosen.  In
        <a class="link" href="apas01.html" title="1. Example Network Map and General Notes">the example network</a>, 
        <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> has a route to the world through <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> and a route to
        192.168.98.0/24 through <code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>.  If <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> sends a packet
        for 192.168.98.0/24 to <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>, the optimal outcome is for
        <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> to suggest with an ICMP redirect that <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> send such
        packets via <code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code> instead.
      </p><p>
        By this method, hosts can learn what networks are reachable
        through which routers on the local network segment.  ICMP redirect
        messages, however, are easy to forge, and were (at one time) used to
        subvert poorly configured machines.  While this is infrequently a
        problem on the Internet today,
        it's still good practice to ignore ICMP redirect
        messages from public networks.  Create static routes where
        necessary on private and public networks to
        prevent ICMP redirect messages from being generated on your network.
      </p><p>
        To examine an example of ICMP redirect in action, we simply
        need to send a packet directly from <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> to
        <code class="systemitem">morgan</code>.  We assume that <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> has a route to 192.168.98.0/24
        via 192.168.99.1 (<code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>), that <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> has no
        such route.

        There's a great deal of information above, so let's examine the
        important parts.  We have the first three packets which passed by our
        NIC as a result of this attempt to establish a session.  First, we see
        a packet from <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> bound for <code class="systemitem">morgan</code> with <code class="systemitem">tristan</code>'s source MAC
        and <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>'s destination MAC.  Because <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> is <code class="systemitem">tristan</code>'s
        default gateway, <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> will send all packets there.
      </p><p>
        The next packet is the ICMP redirect, informing <code class="systemitem">tristan</code> of a 
        better route.  It includes several pieces of information.
        Implicitly, the source IP indicates what router is suggesting the
        alternate route, and the contents specify what the intended
        destination was, and what the better route is.  Note that <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>
        suggests using 192.168.99.1 (<code class="systemitem">isdn-router</code>) as the gateway for this
        destination.
      </p><p>
        The final packet is part of the intended session, but has the MAC
        address of <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code>  on it.  <code class="systemitem">masq-gw</code> has (courteously) informed us
        that we should not use it as a route for the intended destination, but
        has also (courteously) forwarded the packet as we had requested.  In
        this small network, it is acceptable to allow ICMP redirect messages,
        although these should always be dropped at network borders, both
        inbound and outbound.
      </p><p>
        So, in summary, ICMP redirect messages are not intrinsically dangerous
        or problematic, but they shouldn't exist in well-maintained networks.
        If you happen to see them growing in the shadows of your network, some
        careful observation should show you what hosts are affected and which
        routing tables could use some attention.
