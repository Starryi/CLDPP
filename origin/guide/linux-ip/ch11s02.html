      The script will remove all NAT route entries and then all RPDB entries,
      other than the three default entries and anything saying "iif lo".  It
      will then populate the RPDB and create NAT route entries according to
      the configuration file.  Use this script with caution if you have
      customized your RPDB.

#
# -- field descriptions:
#    field 1   this field contains a network address.  Any packets from
#              this network will be translated according to fields two and
#              three, with the exception of any networks specified in fields
#              6 and higher
#    field 2   contains the NAT IP, the IP that only exists as a publicly
#              reachable IP for an internal host
#    field 3   contains the real IP of the machine, usually an internal IP
#    field 4   contains the priority for the NAT rule itself in the RPDB
#    field 5   contains the priority for the routing rule in the RPDB.  In
#              order for the internal networks to reach the real IP of the
#              server/host, this priority must be higher than the priority
#              for the NAT rule.  **lower numbers == higher priority**
#    field 6+  contains a whitespace separated list of networks which
#              should be able to reach the real IP (field 2) directly.
#              The entries into the rule policy database (RPDB) for these
#              networks will prevent packets from real-IP to dest-network
#              from being rewritten with the NAT IP as the source IP.
#              Networks specified here should be subnets of the network
#              specified in field 1.
#
# -- notes
#
#    - white space, lines beginning with a comment and blank lines are ignored
#    - field 5 should always be a lower number (higher priority) than field 4
#    - fields 5 and 6+ are optional
#    - fields 5 and 6+ must be used together, if used at all
#
# -- examples
#
#    - each example is commented with an English description of the network
#      address translation which will occur
#    - followed by a pseudo shellcode description of how to understand
#      exactly what the NAT will look like
#
# -- example #1; NAT a single IP from anywhere
#
# 0/0  10.10.0.14  172.31.254.1  1000
#
# for packets from any address (0/0);
#   if destination_address is 10.10.0.14 ; then
#      rewrite destination address from 10.10.0.14 to 172.31.254.1
#   fi
# done
#
# -- example #2; NAT an entire network (from anywhere)
#
# 0/0  10.13.0.0/16  172.17.0.0/16  1000
#
# for packets from any address (0/0); do
#   if destination_address is in 10.13.0.0/16 ; then
#      rewrite destination address from 10.13.x.x to 172.17.x.x
#   fi
# done
#
# -- example #3; NAT an entire network, but only from a specified nework
#
# 10.10.0.0/16  10.15.0.0/24  192.168.0.0/24  1000
#
# if packet is from 10.10.0.0/16 ; then
#    if destination_address is in 10.15.0.0/24 ; then
#       rewrite destination address from 10.15.0.x to 192.168.0.x
#    fi
# fi
#
# -- example #4; NAT an entire network, but only from a specified nework;
#                make an exception for certain IP ranges
#
# 10.10.0.0/16  10.15.2.0/24  192.168.2.0/24  1000  990  10.10.38.0/24
#
# if packet is from 10.10.0.0/16 and not from 10.10.38.0/24 ; then
#    if destination_address is in 10.15.2.0/24 ; then
#       rewrite destination address from 10.15.2.x to 192.168.2.x
#    fi
# fi
#
# -- example #5; NAT a single IP from anywhere; don't NAT if from specified
#                IP ranges
#
# 0/0  10.74.1.8  192.168.73.15  1000  990  192.168.71.0/24  192.168.70.0/24
#
# for packets from any address except 192.168.71.0/24 and 192.168.70.0/24; do
#    if destination_address is 10.74.1.8 ; then
#       rewrite destination address from 10.74.1.8 to 192.168.73.15
#    fi
# done
#
# -- example #6; NAT to the same IP differently based on the source
#                network IP ranges
#
# 0/0              10.74.1.8      192.168.73.15   1000
# 192.168.71.0/24  192.168.71.15  192.168.73.15    400
# 192.168.70.0/24  192.168.71.15  192.168.73.15    400
#
# N.B., the RPDB must traverse lines two and three first, hence the higher
#       priority.  If the source network is not 192.168.{71,70}.0/24 then
#       the we'll meet the next entry, 1000.
# N.B., the third entry in this example will cause an RTNETLINK: file
#       exists error, because there is already an entry in the local
#       routing table for 192.168.71.15 --NAT--&gt; 192.168.73.15.  Known bug.
