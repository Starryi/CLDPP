If you want to set up your site for dialing in, you have to permit logins on
your serial port and customize some system files to provide UUCP accounts, 
which we will cover in this section. </P

NAME="X-087-2-UUCP.DIALIN.ACCOUNTS"
>16.4.1. Providing UUCP Accounts</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
To begin with, you have to set up user accounts that let remote sites log into
your system and establish a UUCP connection. Generally, you will provide
a separate login name to each system that polls you. When setting up an
account for system <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>pablo</SPAN
>, you might
give it the username <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Upablo</SPAN
>. There is
no enforced policy on login names; they can be just about anything, but it
will be convenient for you if the login name is easily related to the remote
host name.</P
><P
>For systems that dial in through the serial port, you usually have to add
these accounts to the system password file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
>.
It is good practice to put all UUCP logins in a special group, such as
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uuguest</SPAN
>. The account's home directory
should be set to the public spool directory
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucppublic</TT
>&#8201;; its login shell must be
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
>.</P
><P
> 
To serve UUCP systems that connect to your site over TCP, you have to
set up <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inetd</B
> to handle incoming connections on the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
> port by adding the
following line to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

>&#13; 
A major problem with UUCP is that the calling system can lie about its name;
it announces its name to the called system after logging in, but the server
doesn't have any way to check it. Thus, an attacker could log into his or her
own UUCP account, pretend to be someone else, and pick up that other site's
mail. This is particularly troublesome if you offer login via anonymous UUCP,
where the password is made public.</P
><P
>You <EM
>must</EM
> guard against this sort of impostor. The cure
for this disease is to require each system to use a particular login name
by specifying a <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>called-login</SPAN
> in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sys</TT
>. A sample system entry may look like this:

<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>system          pablo
... usual options ...
called-login    Upablo</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The upshot is that whenever a system logs in and pretends it is
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>pablo</SPAN
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> checks whether it has logged in as
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Upablo</SPAN
>. If it hasn't, the
calling system is turned down, and the connection is dropped. You
should make it a habit to add the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>called-login</B
> command to every system entry
you add to your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sys</TT
> file. It is important that
you do this for <EM
>all</EM
> systems in your
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sys</B
> file, regardless of whether they will ever call
your site or not. For those sites that never call you, you should
probably set <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>called-login</SPAN
> to
some totally bogus user name, such as <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>neverlogsin</SPAN
>.</P

NAME="AEN13652"
>16.4.3. Be Paranoid: Call Sequence Checks</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;Another way to fend off and detect impostors is to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>call sequence 
checks</B
>. These help you protect against intruders who somehow manage to find out the password with which you log into your UUCP system.</P
><P
>When using call sequence checks, both machines keep track of the number of
connections established so far. The counter is incremented with each 
connection. After logging in, the caller sends its call sequence number, and 
the receiver checks it against its own number. If they don't match, the 
connection attempt is rejected. If the initial number is chosen at 
random, attackers will have a hard time guessing the correct call sequence 
number.</P
><P
>But call sequence checks do more for you. Even if some very clever
person should detect your call sequence number as well as your password, you
will find out. When the attacker calls your UUCP feed and steals your
mail, this will increase the feeds call sequence number by one. The next time
<EM
>you</EM
> call your feed and try to log in, the remote
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> will refuse you, because the numbers don't match
anymore!</P
><P
>If you have enabled call sequence checks, you should check your log files
regularly for error messages that hint at possible attacks. If your system
rejects the call sequence number the calling system offers,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> will put a message into the log file saying
something like, &#8220;Out of sequence call rejected.&#8221; If your system
is rejected by its feed because the sequence numbers are out of sync, it
will put a message in the log file saying, &#8220;Handshake failed
(RBADSEQ).&#8221;</P
><P
>To enable call sequence checks, add the following command to the
system entry:

></TABLE
></P
><P
>&#13;In addition, you have to create the file containing the sequence
number itself.  Taylor UUCP keeps the sequence number in a file called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.Sequence</TT
> in the remote site's spool
directory. It <EM
>must</EM
> be owned by <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
> and must be mode 600 (i.e., readable
and writeable only by <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
>). It
is best to initialize this file with an arbitrary, previously
agreed-upon start value. A simple way to create this file is:

></H2
><P

If you want to provide anonymous UUCP access to your system, you first have to
set up a special account for it as previously described.  A common practice 
is to give the anonymous account a login name and a password of
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>In addition, you have to set a few of the security options for unknown systems.
For instance, you may want to prohibit them from executing any commands on
your system. However, you cannot set these parameters in a
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sys</TT
> file entry because the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>system</B
> command requires the system's
name, which you don't have. Taylor UUCP solves this dilemma through the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>unknown</B
> command.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>unknown</B
> can be used in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config</TT
> file to specify any command that can usually
appear in a system entry:

<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

unknown         commands rmail</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>This will restrict unknown systems to downloading files from below the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pub</TT
> directory and uploading files to the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>incoming</TT
> directory below
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucppublic</TT
>. The next line will make
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> ignore any requests from the remote system to
turn on debugging locally. The last two lines permit unknown systems to
execute <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmail</B
>&#8201;; but the command path specified makes
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> look for the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmail</B
> command in
a private directory named <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>anon-bin</TT
> only. This restriction
allows you to provide some special <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmail</B
> that, for instance,
forwards all mail to the superuser for examination. This allows anonymous
users to reach the maintainer of the system, but at the same time prevents 
them from injecting any mail to other sites.</P
><P
>To enable anonymous UUCP, you must specify at least one
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>unknown</SPAN

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config</TT
>. Otherwise <B

>uucico</B

reject all unknown systems.</P
