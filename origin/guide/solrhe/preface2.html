Well for one the i have choosen a format, <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, unlike the original manuscript which was written in word, 
                   in this case has the advantage of source being one  and output can be in various format. That is if the source is in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, it is easier now to convert into <acronym class="acronym">HTML, PDF, RTF</acronym> <abbr class="abbrev">etc.</abbr> Also to 
                   prove to the sceptics that DocBook is very much suitable for large production quality projects, not that this is the first effort, in this case an entire book has been marked up in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>.
                 </p></div><p>Infact why <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> indeed? <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> -eXtensible Markup Language  has been able to do justice to a large extent to the hype. Maybe having a watch body like w3.org to monitor
                   has been advantageous; unlike HTML which lacked a formal monitoring, ability to extend, a weak structure and no support for validation,  <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> has all these and more. It is a system-independant, vendor-independant and
                   has behind it the proven experience of SGML implementation, XML being a subset of SGML. I concur with Tim Bray's reported comment that it is ridiculous to use an application like MS Word, Quark Express <abbr class="abbrev">etc.</abbr>for writing text which will be stored as a binary 
                   and proprietory format therby bloating it considerably. And unlike <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> which has about <abbr class="abbrev">aprox.</abbr> 50-60 pre-cooked tags, with <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> one can make up one's own. Infact this facility of having one's own
                   tag will make it very, very useful in the long run. And the inherent factor that <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> is all about content and nothing to do with presentation will be its greatest strength for years to come. The presentation part is taken care of by
                   Stylesheet or FO or some such thing.
