                   this entire book into DocBook/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>.That the source being Markedup in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>,
                   this ensures:
                   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
                         It will become platform independant and the source is not in any proprietory format like word.
                       </p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
                         It will be easy to have different outputs like <acronym class="acronym">HTML, PDF, RTF</acronym> <abbr class="abbrev">etc.</abbr>
                         With the never version of browsers supporting Raw <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> as input with stylesheet 
                         being a seperate component, that this remains ready for that day when it becomes possible to have it converted on the fly.
                       </p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
                         That in the eventuality of me not being involved in the project at a later date, with the 
                         advent of professionals, there will be enough warm bodies to do this job.   
                       </p></li></ul></div><p>
                 </p><p>My fond hope is that this should not turn out be just a futile excersize and it proves usefull to everybody;
                   atleast to some people even they are a small minority, the least of all to Gerhard Mourani, who is the author of 
                   this splendid book.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm127"></a>4.1. Bouquets Brickbats <abbr class="abbrev">Etc.</abbr></h3></div></div></div><p>
                       The idea behind this exercize primarily has been :
                       </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                           To give back something to the Linux community which has been instrumental in 
                           spearheading the spirit of sharing.
                         </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                           To create awareness about possibilities existing with the available tools set.
                         </p></li></ul></div><p>
                     </p><p>
                       But in the process some mistakes might have creeped in but there can be no excuse. Since this book has been looked at twice over; but still, i think the mistakes are entirely mine,
                       if at all and not Gerhard's. So if you spot some glaring mistakes whether be it in the form of wrong or mis-information, typos or grammatical mistakes  please do inform me at 
                       <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:needaguru@yahoo.com">needaguru@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</code> or you can even inform gerhard at <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:gmourani@openna.com">gmourani@openna.com</a>&gt;</code>. I am sure he will give a wallop on my backside( it is quite fragile!) so that such mistakes don't happen next time.
                       Also welcome are the suggestions on how we could improve on this, so that next time round it will much be better.
                     </p><p>
                       Here is hoping that this proves useful despite those already mentioned, creeped in mistakes, errors <abbr class="abbrev">etc.</abbr> and it kindles in you the same spirit which has embodied the growth of Linux as a powerful environement to work in.
                       And if that happens i would consider myself highly obliged and this will prove to be a satisfying endevour for me personally. I have a feeling that the orginal author of this book Gerhard Mourani shares this thought of 
                       mine and probably agrees with me.
