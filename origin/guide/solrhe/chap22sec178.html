           The <code class="filename">access</code> database file can be created to accept or reject mail from selected domains. For example, you may choose to reject all mail originating from known spammers, or to accept to 
           relay all mail from your local network since now relaying is denied by default with Sendmail -<span class="emphasis"><em>this is an Anti-Spam feature</em></span>. In the <code class="filename">access</code> file example below, we'll 
           allow relaying from localhost and all local network addresses beginning with the <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> address <code class="literal">192.168.1</code>. 
           </p><p>
           The files <code class="filename">access</code> and <code class="filename">access.db</code> are not required for Local or Neighbor Client setups. It is required only if you decide to set up a Central Mail Hub to handle all your mail. Also note 
           that the use of a Central Mail Hub will improve the security and the management of other servers and clients on your network that run Sendmail.

           # Description showing bellow for the format of this file comes from
           # the Sendmail source distribution under "cf/README" file.
           #
           # The table itself uses e-mail addresses, domain names, and network
           # numbers as keys. For example,
           #
           #        spammer@aol.com         	REJECT
           #        cyberspammer.com        	REJECT
           #        192.168.212             		REJECT
           #
           # would refuse mail from spammer@aol.com, any user from cyberspammer.com
           # (or any host within the cyberspammer.com domain), and any host on the
           # 192.168.212.* network.
           #
           # The value part of the map can contain:
           #
           #        OK           Accept mail even if other rules in the
           #                        running ruleset would reject it, for example,
           #                        if the domain name is unresolvable.
           #        RELAY   Accept mail addressed to the indicated domain or
           #                        received from the indicated domain for relaying
           #                        through your SMTP server.  RELAY also serves as
           #                        an implicit OK for the other checks.
           #        REJECT  Reject the sender or recipient with a general
           #                        purpose message.
           #        DISCARD    Discard the message completely using the
           #                        $#discard mailer.  This only works for sender
           #                        addresses (i.e., it indicates that you should
           #                        discard anything received from the indicated
           #                        domain).

           #                        the command.
           #
           # For example:
           #
           #        cyberspammer.com        550 We don't accept mail from spammers
           #        okay.cyberspammer.com   	OK
           #        sendmail.org            		OK
           #        128.32                  		RELAY
           #
           # would accept mail from okay.cyberspammer.com, but would reject mail
           # from all other hosts at cyberspammer.com with the indicated message.
           # It would allow accept mail from any hosts in the sendmail.org domain,
           # and allow relaying for the 128.32.*.* network.
           #
           # You can also use the access database to block sender addresses based on
           # the username portion of the address. For example:
           #
           #        FREE.STEALTH.MAILER@    550 Spam not accepted
           #
           # Note that you must include the @ after the username to signify that
           # this database entry is for checking only the username portion of the
           # sender address.
           #
           # If you use like we do in our "sendmail.mc macro configuration:
           #
           #        FEATURE(`blacklist_recipients')
           #
           # then you can add entries to the map for local users, hosts in your
           # domains, or addresses in your domain which should not receive mail:
           #
           #        badlocaluser            550 Mailbox disabled for this username
           #        host.mydomain.com       550 That host does not accept mail
           #        user@otherhost.mydomain.com     550 Mailbox disabled for this recipient
           #
           # This would prevent a recipient of badlocaluser@mydomain.com, any
           # user at host.mydomain.com, and the single address
           # user@otherhost.mydomain.com from receiving mail. Enabling this
           # feature will keep you from sending mails to all addresses that
           # have an error message or REJECT as value part in the access map.
           # Taking the example from above:
           #
           #        spammer@aol.com        	REJECT
           #        cyberspammer.com        	REJECT
           #
           # Mail can't be sent to spammer@aol.com or anyone at cyberspammer.com.
           #
           # Now our configuration of access file,
           # by default we allow relaying from localhost...
