can read, distribute and change code, the code will mature.  People can adapt 
it, fix it, debug it, and they can do it at a speed that dwarfs the performance 
of software developers at conventional companies.  This software will be more 
flexible and of a better quality than software that has been developed using 
the conventional channels, because more people have tested it in more different 
conditions than the closed software developer ever can.
</p><p>The Open Source<a class="indexterm" name="idm457"></a> initiative started to make this clear to the commercial 
world, and very slowly, commercial vendors are starting to see the point.  While
lots of academics and technical people have already been convinced for 20 years 
now that this is the way to go, commercial vendors needed applications like the 
Internet to make them realize they can profit from Open Source.  Now Linux has 
grown past the stage where it was almost exclusively an academic system, useful 
only to a handful of people with a technical background.  Now Linux provides 
more than the operating system: there is an entire infrastructure supporting the
chain of effort of creating an operating system, of making and testing programs 
for it, of bringing everything to the users, of supplying maintenance, updates 
and support and customizations, etcetera.  Today, Linux is ready to accept the 
challenge of a fast-changing world.

is another project that contributed enormously to the popularity of the Linux 
operating system.  This project is called SAMBA<a class="indexterm" name="idm463"></a>, and its achievement is the 
reverse engineering of the Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File 
System (CIFS) protocol used for file- and print-serving on PC-related machines, 
natively supported by MS Windows NT and OS/2, and Linux.  Packages are now 
available for almost every system and provide interconnection solutions in mixed
environments using MS Windows protocols: Windows-compatible (up to and includingWinXP) file- and print-servers.
</p><p>Maybe even more successful than the SAMBA project is the Apache HTTP 
server project.  The server runs on UNIX, Windows NT and many other operating 
systems.  Originally known as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">A PAtCHy server</span>&#8221;</span>, based on existing 
code and a series of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">patch files</span>&#8221;</span>, the name for the matured code 
deserves to be connoted with the native American tribe of the Apache, well-known
for their superior skills in warfare strategy and inexhaustible endurance.  
Apache has been shown to be substantially faster, more stable and more 
feature-full than many other web servers.  Apache is run on sites that get 
millions of visitors per day, and while no official support is provided by the 
developers, the Apache user community provides answers to all your questions.  
Commercial support is now being provided by a number of third parties.
</p><p>In the category of office applications, a choice of <span class="application">MS Office<a class="indexterm" name="idm471"></a></span> suite clones
is available, ranging from partial to full implementations of the applications 
available on MS Windows workstations.  These initiatives helped a great deal to 
make Linux acceptable for the desktop market, because the users don't need extra
training to learn how to work with new systems.  With the desktop comes the 
praise of the common users, and not only their praise, but also their specific 
requirements, which are growing more intricate and demanding by the day.
</p><p>The Open Source<a class="indexterm" name="idm475"></a> community, consisting largely of people who have been 
contributing for over half a decade, assures Linux' position as an important 
player on the desktop market as well as in general IT application.  Paid 
employees and volunteers alike are working diligently so that Linux can maintain
a position in the market.  The more users, the more questions.  The Open Source 
community makes sure answers keep coming, and watches the quality of the answers
with a suspicious eye, resulting in ever more stability and accessibility.
</p><p>Listing all the available Linux software is beyond the scope of this 
guide, as there are tens of thousands of packages.  Throughout this course we 
will present you with the most common packages, which are almost all freely 
available.  In order to take away some of the fear of the beginning user, here's
a screenshot of one of your most-wanted programs.  You can see for yourself that
no effort has been spared to make users who are switching from Windows feel at 
home:
