Their company, StarDivision, was acquired by Sun Microsystems by the end of the 1990s, just before the 5.2 release.  Sun continues development but restricted access to the sources.  Nevertheless, development on the original set of sources continues in the Open Source community, which had to rename the project to <span class="application">OpenOffice<a class="indexterm" name="idm6905"></a></span>.  <span class="application">OpenOffice</span> is now available for a variety of platforms, including MS Windows, Linux, MacOS and Solaris.  There is a screenshot in <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#sect_01_03_02" title="3.2. Ten years of experience at your service">Section 3.2, &#8220;Ten years of experience at your service&#8221;</a>.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, a couple of other quite famous projects took off.  Also a very<a class="indexterm" name="idm6910"></a> common alternative to using MS Office is <span class="application">KOffice</span>, the office suite that used to be popular among SuSE users.  Like the original, this clone incorporates an MS <span class="application">Word</span> and <span class="application">Excel</span> compatible program, and much more.</p><p>Smaller projects deal with particular programs of the MS example suite, such as <span class="application">Abiword</span> and MS <span class="application">Wordview</span> for compatibility with MS <span class="application">Word</span> documents, and <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> for viewing and creating <span class="application">Excel</span> compatible spreadsheets.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sect_06_03_02"></a>3.2. Suites and programs</h3></div></div></div><p>Current distributions usually come with all the necessary tools.  Since these provide excellent guidelines and searchable indexes in the <span class="guimenu">Help</span> menus, we won't discuss them in detail.

If you want to sign messages or files, use GPG, the PGP-compatible <span class="application">GNU Privacy Guard</span> or SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificates.</p><p>These users are not annoyed because they are unable to read these documents, or because they are worried that these formats typically generate much larger files, but rather because of the implication that they are using MS Windows, and possibly because of the extra work of starting some additional programs.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_06_03_03_02"></a>3.3.2. System and user configuration files</h4></div></div></div><p>In the next chapter, we start configuring our environment, and this might include editing all kinds of files that determine how a program behave.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don't edit these files with any office component!</em></span></p><p>The default file format specification  would make the program add several lines of code, defining the format of the file and the fonts used.  These lines won't be interpreted in the correct way by the programs depending on them, resulting in errors or a crash of the program reading the file.  In some cases, you can save the file as plain text, but you'll run into trouble when making this a habit.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_06_03_03_03"></a>3.3.3. But I want a graphical text editor!</h4></div></div></div><p>If you really<a class="indexterm" name="idm6960"></a> insist, try <span class="command"><strong>gedit</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>kedit</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>kwrite</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>xedit</strong></span>; these programs only do text files, which is what we will be needing.  If you plan on doing anything serious, though, stick to a real text mode editor such as <span class="command"><strong>vim</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>emacs</strong></span>.</p><p>An acceptable alternative is <span class="command"><strong>gvim</strong></span>, the <span class="application">Gnome</span> version of <span class="command"><strong>vim</strong></span>.
