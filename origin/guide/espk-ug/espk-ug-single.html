But Emacs is not just a text editor -- it is actually a desktop, in some ways like the graphical desktops that many use today. As a desktop, Emacs comes with all kinds of built-in functions, much like the Windows &#8482; desktop, including an e-mail application, calendar/appointment program, cd-player, games, and more. And like Windows &#8482;, there are many additional applications that you can download and add to Emacs that expand its functionality -- web browsers, the LaTeX text editor, mp3 players, and others. Unlike Windows, all of these powerful tools are under the GPL (Gnu Public License), so you can use them free of charge.</p><p>For visually impaired users, adding Emacspeak to Emacs might be compared to adding Jaws to Windows, except that instead of simply reading the screen to you as a standard "screenreader" might do, Emacspeak treats speech as first-class information about what is going on than a typical screenreader would. In addition, there are many special commands just for Emacspeak that enhance interaction with a variety of Emacs applications.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="about-this-tutorial"></a>2.2. About this tutorial</h3></div></div></div><p>Because Emacs and Emacspeak are unlike any environments you may have used before, it helps to know a little bit about how they work. This tutorial assumes that you have either used and are familiar with Emacs and Emacspeak or that you have completed some of the Emacs and Emacspeak tutorials. For a list of recommended tutorials, please refer to <a class="link" href="#getting-started" title="3.1. Getting started with Emacs and Emacspeak">Getting started</a>.</p><p>This tutorial is organized by task and sub-task.  For example, the Internet section contains sub-sections on browsing the Internet, using email, chatting online, and other tasks. The File Manipulation section contains information on downloading and installing files, finding files, etc. For a complete listing of the available tasks, refer to the table of contents.</p><p>Within this tutorial, you will find references to a number of Emacspeak-enabled applications, some that are included within the Emacs application, and some that are add-ons and must be downloaded.  Please note that the applications listed in this tutorial should not be considered a complete collection of applications but only a small subset. The complete list of Emacspeak-enabled applications is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html" target="_top">http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="before-you-begin"></a>3. Before you begin</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="getting-started"></a>3.1. Getting started with Emacs and Emacspeak</h3></div></div></div><p>Before you get started with Emacs and Emacspeak, you must install both. Most distributions come with Emacs, or you can download it from the Emacs home page at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</a>. If you have not already installed Emacspeak, you can download it from <a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/</a>. For Emacspeak installation information, please refer to the Emacspeak Installation HOWTO available at the Emacspeak home page, <a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net" target="_top">http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net</a>. </p><p>If you've never used Emacs or Emacspeak before, you'll probably want to try some of the following tutorials:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>"A gentle introduction to Emacspeak," by Gary Lawrence Murphy,
<a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak-guide.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html/" target="_top">http://emacspeak-guide.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html/</a>. Gary provides a lighthearted but thorough introduction to Emacs and Emacspeak, focusing on users who are not familiar with either application.  This introduction is recommend as a starting point, even before you do the Emacs tutorial (see next item).</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>"The (Official) Emacs Tutorial," by the Free Software Foundation. I call this the "official" tutorial because it is included with Emacs. To access this tutorial, start Emacs, then type <span class="command"><strong>C-h t</strong></span> (Control h t).  This tutorial discusses the basic Emacs commands, including navigation, using Emacs as a text editor, and a bit about how Emacs works "under the hood." For new users this tutorial is strongly recommended, and even those users who are familiar with Emacs might find something they didn't already know.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>"Emacspeak Tutorial," by Nita Van Zandt, available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mv.com/ipusers/vanzandt/emacspeak-tutorial-1.0.tar.gz" target="_top">http://www.mv.com/ipusers/vanzandt/emacspeak-tutorial-1.0.tar.gz</a>.

It is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html" target="_top">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html</a> and is also bundled into some of the newer Linux distributions. The Beginner's HOWTO discusses many of the topics discussed in the Emacs tutorial, and also includes overviews of some of the more popular Emacs packages, including VM, Gnus, BBDB, and AucTeX (some of which are discussed in this HOWTO).</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, you might want to peruse <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnusoftware.com/WebRing/zone.cgi?list" target="_top">http://www.gnusoftware.com/WebRing/zone.cgi?list</a>, which provides a list of Emacs resource sites.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="emacs-conventions"></a>3.2. Emacs Command Conventions</h3></div></div></div><p>Emacs commands are denoted by holding down either the <span class="command"><strong>Control</strong></span> key or the <span class="command"><strong>Meta</strong></span> key, then pressing one or more alphanumeric keys. On today's keyboards, the <span class="command"><strong>Alt</strong></span> key provides the same functionality as the old <span class="command"><strong>Meta</strong></span> key, or alternatively you can press the <span class="command"><strong>Esc</strong></span> key followed by the alphanumeric keys (you don't have to hold down the <span class="command"><strong>Esc</strong></span> key). Because different documents sometimes use different notation to denote these sequences, this section explains the notation used in this HOWTO.  For consistency, this HOWTO uses the same notation as is used in the Emacs menus.</p><p>There are a few different types of key sequences you may see. The first is commonly written in the form <span class="command"><strong>C-x C-s</strong></span>.  The letter "C," followed by a hypen, literally means "hold down the Control key" (the letter "M" would denote the Meta (Alt or Esc) key), and the additional letters denote specific commands.  This example, which saves the current file, should be interpreted as, "Hold down the Control key, press the letter x followed by the letter s, then release the Control key."</p><p>Another common  sequence is written in the form <span class="command"><strong>C-x d</strong></span>. Again, the letter "C" followed by a hyphen denotes holding down the Control key.  However, because the second letter of the sequence does not have a "C-" in front of it, you do not hold down the Control key while pressing the second letter. Thus, this command should be interpreted as, "Hold down the Control key and type x, then release the Control key and type d." Sometimes you may see commands with more than one letter after them, such as <span class="command"><strong>C-e d w</strong></span>. The same rules apply: you should hold down the Control key, press "e," release the Control key, then press "d" and "w".</p><p>Finally, you may see commands that use actual words, such as <span class="command"><strong>M-x emacspeak-toggle-word-echo</strong></span>. Fortunately, most of
	these longer commands have a shorthand command (in this case,
	<span class="command"><strong>C-e d w</strong></span>.  However, should you opt to type
	the entire command, you would hold down the Meta or Alt key,
	type x, release the Meta key, then type
	emacspeak-toggle-word-echo.

These pages cover just about every Linux command.  The only drawback to using the man pages is that you must know the name of the command you want information about. To read a man entry:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>From inside Emacs, type <span class="command"><strong>M-x man</strong></span>. You will be prompted for the manual entry you want to view.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type the manual entry name (for example, <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span>).

It is by no means an exhaustive list of what goes on in Linux system administration but rather a collection of a few common tasks that a new user may find useful. If you would like more information on Linux system administration, refer to the online Linux System Administrators' Guide, found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/gs/node6.html#chapsysadmnum" target="_top">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/gs/node6.html#chapsysadmnum</a>.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="changing-your-password"></a>4.1. Changing your password</h3></div></div></div><p>Every time you log onto a Linux system, you must provide a password for your account. Occasionally you may wish to change your password, and many systems require that you do so regularly for added security.</p><p>Changing your password is done in the Emacs shell. Normally, changing your password in the Emacs shell displays it on the screen and also speaks it aloud. However, Emacspeak adds a line to your <code class="filename">.emacs</code> file that keeps Emacs from echoing your password either visually or orally. Of course, it's still a good idea to change your password in a secure area where no-one is likely to watch you type it in. To change your password:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>From inside Emacs, type <span class="command"><strong>M-x shell</strong></span> to launch an Emacs shell.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span>. You will be prompted for both your current password and your new password.</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that some systems require passwords to be a certain length or contain certain characters such as numbers. If your password entry is rejected for some reason, keep trying.  In general, most 6-8 letter passwords that contain at least one number work well. Of course, be sure it's easy for you to remember!</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="installing-applications"></a>4.2. Installing applications</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="about-emacs-applications"></a>4.2.1. About Emacs applications</h4></div></div></div><p>As an Emacs user, you can mentally divide applications into two categories: those that are native to Emacs (that is, those applications written specifically for Emacs), and those that are not (for example, command-line applications). If an application is not Emacs-native, you can still run it from the Emacs shell command line.  To run the application, type the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x shell</strong></span> to start the shell then the appropriate command to start the application. If the application is native to Emacs, you can type <span class="command"><strong>M-x name-of-application</strong></span> to start the application. The application will run directly in the Emacs buffer.</p><p>Sometimes, even though an application wasn't designed specifically for Emacs, you can install a special wrapper file that makes Emacs think the application is Emacs-native. These special files have a <code class="filename">.el</code>, or Emacs-lisp, extension. After you've downloaded and installed a new application, if a <code class="filename">.el</code> file exists for it, you can download that file too.  Place it in the correct directory, add the appropriate line to your <code class="filename">.emacs</code> file so that Emacs will recognize the application, and you'll be able to run the application as if it were native to Emacs. </p><p>As an Emacspeak user, you'll also want to know which applications are Emacspeak-enabled. These Emacspeak-enabled applications have a second special <code class="filename">.el</code> wrapper file that contains Emacspeak-specific commands that provide audio feedback just for that application. For a complete list of Emacspeak-enabled applications, see <a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html" target="_top">http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html</a>. All avaliable <code class="filename">emacspeak-*.el</code> files are included with Emacspeak, so you won't have to download them.</p><p>So, when you install a new application, you'll need the following three things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>The application.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>A <code class="filename">.el</code> file for that application, if you want to run it directly from Emacs instead of from the Emacs shell command line.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>An <code class="filename">emacspeak-*.el</code> file for the application, if you want to run it directly from Emacs and have it Emacspeak-enabled. Check in the /emacspeak/lisp directory to see if one exists for your application.</p></li></ul></div><p>Whenever possible, this HOWTO tells you specifically whether or not an application is Emacs-native, and if not, where to get the special <code class="filename">.el</code> wrapper files if they are available.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="downloading-applications"></a>4.2.2. Downloading your application</h4></div></div></div><p>Once you've chosen a new application to install, you'll need to download it. Typically you'll use either <span class="application">FTP</span> application or the <span class="application">wget</span> application to download your new Linux application, since most of them are distributed only on the Internet. If you are unfamiliar with the <span class="application">FTP</span> and <span class="application">wget</span> applications, refer to, <a class="link" href="#downloading-files" title="5.1. Downloading files">Downloading files</a>, for information on how to use these applications to get your files.</p><p>Usually, the files you download will have some sort of extension (the letters after the "dot" or "period" in the file name) that denotes what type of file it is. If your file has a .gz or .tar extension, refer to 
<a class="link" href="#uncompressing-files" title="4.2.3. Uncompressing files">Uncompressing files</a>.  If your file has a .rpm extension, refer to 
<a class="link" href="#installing-rpms" title="4.2.4. Installing RPMs">Installing RPMs</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="uncompressing-files"></a>4.2.3. Uncompressing files</h4></div></div></div><p>Most files are compressed in at least one (and sometimes multiple) ways. You can tell how a file was compressed, and thus how to uncompress it, by the extensions on the file.  The most common extensions are .tar and .gz, though there are others.</p><p>If your downloaded file has multiple extensions, you'll have to uncompress it one step at a time, uncompressing the last extension first.  For example, if the file is named <code class="filename">foo.tar.gz</code>, complete the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Start the <span class="application">Emacs</span>shell using the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x shell</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If necessary, use the <span class="command"><strong>cd</strong></span> (change directory) command to move to the directory that contains your downloaded file.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the Emacs shell command prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>gunzip foo.tar.gz</strong></span>. The file will be unzipped, leaving you with a file called <code class="filename">foo.tar</code> in your directory. Files with a .tar extension are commonly known as "tarballs."</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the command prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>tar -xvf foo.tar</strong></span>. The tarball will be uncompressed, usually leaving either a single file or a new directory that contains a number of files.</p><p>Some recent versions of the <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> command will both uncompress and untar a file if you add the <span class="command"><strong>-z</strong></span> option. Thus, the command <span class="command"><strong>tar -xvfz foo.tar.gz</strong></span> would both uncompress and untar the file.</p></li></ol></div><p>If you ended up with a new directory after you uncompressed your files, it probably contains files with names like <code class="filename">INSTALL</code>, <code class="filename">NOTES</code>, or <code class="filename">README</code>, among others. These files usually include instructions for installing that specific application. As each application may have a different installation process, you should read these files carefully and follow any instructions they may provide. You'll probably need to be the root user to actually install any applications, as only root usually has the necessary permissions. </p><p>If you ended up with a single file after uncompressing, it probably has either a .rpm extension or some other type of extension, such as .el. If it has a .rpm extension, refer to <a class="link" href="#installing-rpms" title="4.2.4. Installing RPMs">Installing RPMs</a>. If the file has some other extension, refer to the website where you downloaded it for more information.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="installing-rpms"></a>4.2.4. Installing RPMs</h4></div></div></div><p>If you downloaded or uncompressed a file that has a .rpm extension, you're in luck! It is a Red Hat Package Manager file that contains all the information it needs to install itself automatically. Assuming that your distribution supports RPMs, you can install the file as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open a root shell using the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x emacspeak-root</strong></span>, which is bound to <span class="command"><strong>C-e C-r</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the command prompt, type <span class="command"><strong>rpm -xfv foo.rpm</strong></span>.

The calendar and diary support both US and European date formats, but default to the US format. The diary keeps track of appointments and reminders using a diary file, a text file that contains a list of events and their dates. You can have Emacs send you an email every day with your schedule, or you can look at the calendar to view the day's events.</p><p>To start the calendar application, use the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x calendar</strong></span>. Calendar navigation commands are, for the most part, identical to text navigation commands, and you can also use the arrow keys to navigate.</p><p>If you'd like to use the diary, you need to create a diary file that contains your events.  The diary file is a simple text file, and, by default, Emacs uses <code class="filename">~/diary</code> as the diary file. Although you'll need to create the file manually, there are commands that allow you to add, view, and change diary entries. Most of these commands are Emacspeak-enabled.</p><p>Diary entries come in a number of formats and entries can be set to repeat.  Below are some examples:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>12/22/2001</td><td>Mom arrives for visit</td><td>Appears once on 12/22/2001</td></tr><tr><td>October 17</td><td>Joe's birthday</td><td>Repeats yearly on October 17th</td></tr><tr><td>Friday</td><td>Time cards due</td><td>Repeats every Friday</td></tr></table><p>Of course, there are many more options than those shown here.

Alternatively, you can have the day's appointments automatically displayed when you enter Emacs by adding the following line to your <code class="filename">.emacs</code> file:</p><pre class="programlisting">(diary)</pre><p>You can also have your events emailed to you on a daily basis by running the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x diary-mail-entries</strong></span>.  You'll probably get an error message the first time you do this that says, "No buffer named *Fancy Diary Entries*." This error message was reported as a bug to the bug-gnu-emacs mailing list by Tim Hesterberg. However, the command does in fact work, so you can just ignore the error message. By default, you'll be e-mailed the calendar entries for the next seven days.  Also, when you enter Emacs it will automatically show you the calendar entries for the next seven days. According to the GNU Emacs Manual, there is a way to change the number of days the email covers, but according to Tim that feature also has bugs and doesn't seem to work. At the time of writing, these problems have not been addressed.</p><p>For complete instructions on using the calendar and diary, refer to the section on the calendar and diary in the GNU Emacs Manual, located at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html" target="_top">http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="writing-text"></a>7.5. Writing text in Emacs</h3></div></div></div><p>Emacs provides for many modes of text editing, and the tools you should use are task-dependent.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="writing-print-pdf-postscript"></a>7.5.1. Writing for print, PDF, or postscript</h4></div></div></div><p>If you want to output your writing in print, postscript, or PDF, <span class="application">LaTeX</span> is the way to go. <span class="application">LaTeX</span> is essentially a markup language that produces high-quality print, PDF, or postscript output.  <span class="application">LaTeX</span> was designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation, and in addition to allowing for detailed formatting, it also provides support for mathematical functions, automatic generation of bibliographies and indexes, graphics support, and much more.

You can download the file <code class="filename">mpg123-el-1.24-1.tar.gz</code> (the latest Emacs-enabled version) from Debian at <a class="ulink" href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mpg123-el/" target="_top">http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mpg123-el/</a>.  </p><p>Once you've downloaded the file, you'll need to install it using the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open an Emacs shell using the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x shell</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change directories to the directory containing the new file.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unzip the file using the command <span class="command"><strong>gunzip mpg123-el-1.24-1.tar.gz</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Untar the resulting <code class="filename">mpg123-el-1.24-1.tar</code> file using the command <span class="command"><strong>tar -xvf mpg123-el-1.24-1.tar</strong></span>. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change directories into the resulting <code class="filename">mpg123-el-1.24-1.tar</code> directory.

You'll be asked for a file name to play. Type in the name of the mp3 to play, then press Return. It should start playing immediately. </p><p>There are a number of commands that can be used with <span class="application">mpg123</span>; a few of the more commonly used ones are listed below:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>SPC</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Play or pause</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>RET</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Play</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>V</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Volume up</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>v</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Volume down</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>q</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Quit</p></dd></dl></div><p>For a full list of <span class="application">mpg123</span> commands, you can scroll up and down within the application to have them read aloud.</p><p>One note about volume in <span class="application">mpg123</span>: in my tests, I found that often the system volume would go way down when I started <span class="application">mpg123</span>, to the point where I could barely hear it. If I exited <span class="application">mpg123</span>, the volume in Emacspeak would continue to be extremely low, regardless of how it was set before I started <span class="application">mpg123</span>.  However, if I turned up the volume while in <span class="application">mpg123</span>, not only was it at an acceptable level in <span class="application">mpg123</span>, it was also loud after I quit <span class="application">mpg123</span>.</p><p>Another problem that I noticed when using <span class="application">mpg123</span> is that sometimes when you quit the application, it doesn't seem to relinquish control of the sound card. You'll see evidence of this behavior if you try to play a CD or restart <span class="application">mpg123</span> - you'll get an error message saying that your sound card is busy or that it's not installed correctly. If you check the list of open Emacs buffers, you'll see that <span class="application">mpg123</span> is still there, although it's apparently in a questionable state. I have not yet figured out how to remedy this problem; if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know so it can be added to the HOWTO. </p><p>If you find yourself listening to a lot of MP3s, there is an mp3 jukebox written by Karl Dahlke available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/jukebox" target="_top">http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/jukebox</a>, and a sample config file for the jukebox at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/sample.jukerc" target="_top">http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/sample.jukerc</a>.

The first step is to convert the tracks on an audio CD to <code class="filename">.wav</code> format, then convert the <code class="filename">.wav</code> files to MP3s.
