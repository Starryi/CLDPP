Gary provides a lighthearted but thorough introduction to Emacs and Emacspeak, focusing on users who are not familiar with either application.  This introduction is recommend as a starting point, even before you do the Emacs tutorial (see next item).</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>"The (Official) Emacs Tutorial," by the Free Software Foundation. I call this the "official" tutorial because it is included with Emacs. To access this tutorial, start Emacs, then type <span class="command"><strong>C-h t</strong></span> (Control h t).  This tutorial discusses the basic Emacs commands, including navigation, using Emacs as a text editor, and a bit about how Emacs works "under the hood." For new users this tutorial is strongly recommended, and even those users who are familiar with Emacs might find something they didn't already know.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>"Emacspeak Tutorial," by Nita Van Zandt, available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mv.com/ipusers/vanzandt/emacspeak-tutorial-1.0.tar.gz" target="_top">http://www.mv.com/ipusers/vanzandt/emacspeak-tutorial-1.0.tar.gz</a>.

On today's keyboards, the <span class="command"><strong>Alt</strong></span> key provides the same functionality as the old <span class="command"><strong>Meta</strong></span> key, or alternatively you can press the <span class="command"><strong>Esc</strong></span> key followed by the alphanumeric keys (you don't have to hold down the <span class="command"><strong>Esc</strong></span> key). Because different documents sometimes use different notation to denote these sequences, this section explains the notation used in this HOWTO.  For consistency, this HOWTO uses the same notation as is used in the Emacs menus.</p><p>There are a few different types of key sequences you may see. The first is commonly written in the form <span class="command"><strong>C-x C-s</strong></span>.  The letter "C," followed by a hypen, literally means "hold down the Control key" (the letter "M" would denote the Meta (Alt or Esc) key), and the additional letters denote specific commands.  This example, which saves the current file, should be interpreted as, "Hold down the Control key, press the letter x followed by the letter s, then release the Control key."</p><p>Another common  sequence is written in the form <span class="command"><strong>C-x d</strong></span>. Again, the letter "C" followed by a hyphen denotes holding down the Control key.  However, because the second letter of the sequence does not have a "C-" in front of it, you do not hold down the Control key while pressing the second letter. Thus, this command should be interpreted as, "Hold down the Control key and type x, then release the Control key and type d." Sometimes you may see commands with more than one letter after them, such as <span class="command"><strong>C-e d w</strong></span>. The same rules apply: you should hold down the Control key, press "e," release the Control key, then press "d" and "w".</p><p>Finally, you may see commands that use actual words, such as <span class="command"><strong>M-x emacspeak-toggle-word-echo</strong></span>. Fortunately, most of
	these longer commands have a shorthand command (in this case,
	<span class="command"><strong>C-e d w</strong></span>.  However, should you opt to type
	the entire command, you would hold down the Meta or Alt key,
	type x, release the Meta key, then type
	emacspeak-toggle-word-echo.
