You can invoke a major mode by creating and/or opening a file with the appropriate extension. For example, to invoke the c++ major mode, create a file with a <code class="filename">.cpp</code> extension and then open that file. You can also download additional major modes, such as SGML.</p><p>Because of the breadth of coding options, it is beyond the scope of this document to cover them all.

In a nutshell, auditory icons provide you with feedback when you perform different tasks in Emacs.  You can get audible feedback when you change buffers, quit a program, enter the buffers list, edit C code, etc.</p><p>If you want to use auditory icons and ViaVoice is your speech synthesizer, check to see whether or not you have a multi-channel sound card (try playing a CD and a .au file at the same time - if it works, you have a multi-channel card). If your card is not multi-channel, you must install the application <span class="application">stdiom</span> as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Download the application <span class="application">stdiosynth</span> from

You should get a message that says, "stdiosynth is up to date."</p></li></ol></div><p>Currently there are two auditory icon themes that you can download from the Emacspeak website, called Chimes and Cartoons.  Chimes is made up of different chimes and short notes from various instruments. The icons are high-quality 44K-mono, and can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/chimes-mono.tar.gz" target="_top">http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/chimes-mono.tar.gz</a>. The Cartoons theme was contributed by Bryan Smart and is made up of 22K-mono sounds.  You can download it from 
<a class="ulink" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/cartoons-mono.tar.gz" target="_top">http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/cartoons-mono.tar.gz</a>.</p><p>To install either of these themes, download and unpack the archives into the emacspeak/sounds directory in your emacspeak installation. You can then select themes you have already installed by using the Emacspeak command <span class="command"><strong>M-x emacspeak-sounds-select-theme</strong></span>.

The main website is at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/" target="_top">http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/</a>, and you can download a precompiled binary (unless, of course, you're interested in playing with the source code, in which case you'd download the source) from <a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tgz" target="_top">ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tgz</a>.</p><p>Assuming that you downloaded the binary file <code class="filename">xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tgz</code>, to install and run<span class="application">Xpdf</span>: </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open an Emacs command shell using <span class="command"><strong>M-x shell</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change to the appropriate directory where the <code class="filename">xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tgz</code> file is located, then unzip the file using <span class="command"><strong>gunzip xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tgz</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Decompress the resulting <code class="filename">xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tar</code> file using the command <span class="command"><strong>tar -xvf xpdf-0.92-linux2.0.tar</strong></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>The resulting directory will be called <code class="filename">xpdf-0.92-linux2.0</code>.

The calendar and diary support both US and European date formats, but default to the US format. The diary keeps track of appointments and reminders using a diary file, a text file that contains a list of events and their dates. You can have Emacs send you an email every day with your schedule, or you can look at the calendar to view the day's events.</p><p>To start the calendar application, use the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x calendar</strong></span>. Calendar navigation commands are, for the most part, identical to text navigation commands, and you can also use the arrow keys to navigate.</p><p>If you'd like to use the diary, you need to create a diary file that contains your events.  The diary file is a simple text file, and, by default, Emacs uses <code class="filename">~/diary</code> as the diary file. Although you'll need to create the file manually, there are commands that allow you to add, view, and change diary entries. Most of these commands are Emacspeak-enabled.</p><p>Diary entries come in a number of formats and entries can be set to repeat.  Below are some examples:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>12/22/2001</td><td>Mom arrives for visit</td><td>Appears once on 12/22/2001</td></tr><tr><td>October 17</td><td>Joe's birthday</td><td>Repeats yearly on October 17th</td></tr><tr><td>Friday</td><td>Time cards due</td><td>Repeats every Friday</td></tr></table><p>Of course, there are many more options than those shown here. You can find a complete listing of diary features in the GNU Emacs manual, located at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html" target="_top">http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html</a>.</p><p>You can view the diary entries for the current date using the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x diary</strong></span>. Alternatively, you can have the day's appointments automatically displayed when you enter Emacs by adding the following line to your <code class="filename">.emacs</code> file:</p><pre class="programlisting">(diary)</pre><p>You can also have your events emailed to you on a daily basis by running the command <span class="command"><strong>M-x diary-mail-entries</strong></span>.  You'll probably get an error message the first time you do this that says, "No buffer named *Fancy Diary Entries*." This error message was reported as a bug to the bug-gnu-emacs mailing list by Tim Hesterberg. However, the command does in fact work, so you can just ignore the error message. By default, you'll be e-mailed the calendar entries for the next seven days.  Also, when you enter Emacs it will automatically show you the calendar entries for the next seven days. According to the GNU Emacs Manual, there is a way to change the number of days the email covers, but according to Tim that feature also has bugs and doesn't seem to work. At the time of writing, these problems have not been addressed.</p><p>For complete instructions on using the calendar and diary, refer to the section on the calendar and diary in the GNU Emacs Manual, located at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html" target="_top">http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_376.html</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="writing-text"></a>7.5. Writing text in Emacs</h3></div></div></div><p>Emacs provides for many modes of text editing, and the tools you should use are task-dependent.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="writing-print-pdf-postscript"></a>7.5.1. Writing for print, PDF, or postscript</h4></div></div></div><p>If you want to output your writing in print, postscript, or PDF, <span class="application">LaTeX</span> is the way to go. <span class="application">LaTeX</span> is essentially a markup language that produces high-quality print, PDF, or postscript output.  <span class="application">LaTeX</span> was designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation, and in addition to allowing for detailed formatting, it also provides support for mathematical functions, automatic generation of bibliographies and indexes, graphics support, and much more.
